1024591620 [5830] <pam/#webco> josh:  i sent the support email for you to look at, thanks!
1024611102 [6912] <pam/#webco> josh:  she didn't bump it around a lot.  It was just heavy and she carefully dragged down
1024611137 [6920] <pam/#webco> it wasn't violent

1024689436 [8814] <pam/#webco> what is our option then?
1024689464 [8818] <pam/#webco> are there reasons why they weren't upgraded in the last round?
1024689656 [8838] <pam/#webco> adam:  they are some small things that they need but there are some other issues i thought the best place to start is get them on the latest version and then see what bugs we're still getting
1024690020 [8906] <pam/#webco> adam:  what then for uri?
1024690048 [8910] <pam/#webco> what is the EC error?

1025628974 [623] <pam/#webco> morning everyone
1025628984 [625] <pam/#webco> adam:  shall we reschedule our meeting for today?
1025629056 [633] <pam/#webco> adam: no, I am still digging through my mail, i'll go a lookin
1025629075 [635] <pam/#webco> sure, 4pm works for me
1025716641 [3122] <pam/#webco> hi hi
1025888432 [4725] <pam/#webco> adam: what up?
1025888613 [4743] <pam/#webco> adam:  i don't know where it is, i will take a few min to look around though
1026233527 [1121] <pam/#webco> adam:  are the flat fees being worked on in 2.0.9 going to allow a fee to be assigned to a resource in addition to the daily usage fee?
1026233775 [1129] <pam/#webco> can any one tell me how the flat fees are going to work in 2.0.9, please
1026233925 [1143] <pam/#webco> adam: ok, there
1026233965 [1155] <pam/#webco> ok
1026234030 [1165] <pam/#webco> ok, can a client do both flat and set a daily usage fee at the same time or does it have to be one or the other?
1026234062 [1175] <pam/#webco> hmm, denver has daily usage fees plus a "set up" fee for some resources, any ideas
1026234133 [1194] <pam/#webco> so for every resource that has the set up fee they would add this "rtype" to the allocation?
1026234173 [1202] <pam/#webco> yes
1026234185 [1210] <pam/#webco> ok
1026234262 [1222] <pam/#webco> ok, i get it, thanks
1026234282 [1230] <pam/#webco> yep, thank you
1026234351 [1240] <pam/#webco> and then the rsrc under "labor" rtype would be called like "set" or "strike", right?
1026238251 [1346] <pam/#webco> luck of the draw - or German relatives
1026238259 [1348] <pam/#webco> used to be Diamont
1026238305 [1356] <pam/#webco> my alter-ego
1026238339 [1366] <pam/#webco> we could put and act together
1026238349 [1368] <pam/#webco> hmmm, maybe not the gay porn...

1026837014 [2142] <pam/#webco> i know about those, I already talked to them and explained how they needed to be filled out, sorry I sould have advised support!
1026837043 [2149] <pam/#webco> they are supposed to be sending new ones to be checked out, hopefully they are better
1026837184 [2155] <pam/#webco> I tried, it was not easy!!  Try explaining excel and databases to the guy trying to complete the templates - it gave me a headache!!
1026837242 [2161] <pam/#webco> yes, after about 15 min of trying to explain that to him, he finally got it...i know you're jealous...

1029535681 [46773] <pam/#webco> adam:  all of the root resources i tried to open yesterday on usc were slow 
1029535883 [46797] <pam/#webco> adam: yes, it was reported yesterday and I have been working with usc so much lately that I would have noticed it b/f if it was happening
1029535899 [46801] <pam/#webco> adam: the import of the zemetkis center stuff happened
1029536427 [46845] <pam/#webco> joel and I were actually looking at both yesterday and they both were slow, I tried their site just now and it is much faster than the staged
1029536756 [46877] <pam/#webco> adam: i need to go, have an appointment.  I can do some more testing from home and give more info on bugzilla from there, ok?
1029873129 [49188] <pam/#webco> can someone tell me what it means if a resources status is RSVP-CANCELLED?
1029873891 [49193] <pam/#webco> why would that be the status of the resource though?  shouldn't it just be available?
1029873914 [49199] <pam/#webco> yes
1029874071 [49207] <pam/#webco> you can check it out but you can't take it offline
1029874399 [49217] <pam/#webco> squek squek
1029874788 [49231] <pam/#webco> adam: ok, doing a lot of 2.0.10 testing today, am finding some bugs that are not on the release notes, should those be logged and then milestoned for 2.0.10 or logged some other way?
1029874807 [49239] <pam/#webco> yes
1029874813 [49241] <pam/#webco> reported

1030035571 [52000] <pam/#webco> josh:  the one's he sent in last week, yes.  Yesterday's I havn't yet.  I called him because I need to clarify some things first.
1030035624 [52018] <pam/#webco> yea, one of those is even fixed already i think
1030035729 [52030] <pam/#webco> josh: the one's he sent in yesterday were on 2.0.9 and they are going to be using the new invoice section in 2.0.10.  I should still file those right?
1030035814 [52050] <pam/#webco> ok, the one is a ui issue and won't exist in 2.0.10 and the other one is the one I called him on because I can't figure out how he got it to do what it did
1030035874 [52062] <pam/#webco> ok
1030036024 [52070] <pam/#webco> adam:  that's what I figured.  I wasn't going to file the UI one and the other one needs furhter investigation
1030037155 [52107] <pam/#webco> josh:  on the uiuc printing issue, I walked her through adam's instructions he sent yesterday and they are all set on printing so you can mark that off the list!

1030134626 [53412] <pam/#webco> josh:  on that error for Airdri for UCB, is the reservation she is trying to edit have any scheduled repeating reservations on it?
1030134745 [53425] <pam/#webco> ok, was able to recreate the problem on the demo if I tried to edit one with repeats on it

1030134918 [53440] <pam/#webco> josh: are you working on gordon?  adam left me a msg to remind you but he left you a msg too
1030134930 [53443] <pam/#webco> editing the original with repeats, editing one of the repeats worked fine
1030139924 [53515] <pam/#webco> josh: you want me to report the error from evergreen or you got it?
1030140534 [53535] <pam/#webco> josh: joel on the phone - AAAAASAAAAAAA- is the cinapps thing still running?  wants to know what if they interrupt it now?

1030486449 [58287] <pam/#webco> adam:  I knew the delete bug was already filed and fixed but the bug on uiuc instance should still be filed, right?

1030561151 [60760] <pam/#webco> got it now, thx
1030569406 [61092] <pam/#webco> lee:  not being able to edit res with repeats on it?  4173
1030569852 [61118] <pam/#webco> adam:  it shouldn't cause a problem, there is nothing in there that is data they need
1030570038 [61186] <pam/#webco> lee:  you can't make a new repeating?  I did one on the demo
1030570436 [61246] <pam/#webco> ok
1030570609 [61271] <pam/#webco> adam:  what is the new Effective Patron Class on the Patron tab?
1030570716 [61286] <pam/#webco> craigl:  sorry, my mistake I think, are you on usc.webckeckout.net?  cause the problem is on their server instance
1030570988 [61311] <pam/#webco> craigl: weird, I hit the find groups button and nothing happens, what if you do it first before entering an id?
1030571041 [61315] <pam/#webco> craigl: it doens't allow you to search for the patron, what if you don't know the number right off?
1030572456 [61491] <pam/#webco> adam:  if the operator knows a partial id for the production group, should it populate or bring up a pick list?
1030572640 [61493] <pam/#webco> adam:  is the umich site I am testing supposed to have all of the fixes that craig has done?
1030572721 [61509] <pam/#webco> ok, so I should re-open any that still do not work 
1030572858 [61537] <pam/#webco> every thing i do is ill-stated but i'm getting better
1030572884 [61549] <pam/#webco> did I sound harsh?
1030572920 [61555] <pam/#webco> no harshing taken, just self-deprecating
1030572932 [61559] <pam/#webco> i think it is exhaustion
1030573059 [61563] <pam/#webco> adam: I have to fly, have stupid dinner with Gordon's business people, yuck, I will be back early tomorrow for a 1030 training with evergreen and will test the crap out of 2.1

1030635420 [62380] <pam/#webco> josh:  evergreen says they went down last night and now I am on their instance and I don't see any resources lists on the circulation applet, any ideas?
1030635525 [62384] <pam/#webco> i agree

1030653415 [63552] <pam/#webco> no, you don't have to, if you choose a preset it runs the report w/o the find button
1030653524 [63560] <pam/#webco> sorry, it's the way the app works, I assumed it wouldn't be needed
1030654008 [63629] <pam/#webco> craig:  I will try to be more detailed, in the mean time tell which bugs you are talking about, I will look at the status one and update
1030658363 [63881] <pam/#webco> josh: I updated the UCS bug with the resource/resource type weirdness - I tried to describe it best I could but it's kind of ugly

1033068623 [8157] <pam/#webco> did it get moved? cause it's not on the admin page
1033069112 [8179] <pam/#webco> adam: I can't find manange operators link on 2.1, is that a bug or did it get moved to another section of the app?
1033069422 [8188] <pam/#webco> ok
1033070675 [8243] <pam/#webco> adam: trying to figure out operators, if I go to the detail screen of the webcheckout preview user or boss the Operator tab says "not employee of FVL" how is this suppose to work?
1033072187 [8303] <pam/#webco> adam: if you add a person to a checkout you can get to their detail screen there and bypass the find people screen
1033073299 [8397] <pam/#webco> josh: bernie just called me, there is a tall ladder in the basement we can use to put in light bulbs, supplies come tomorrow so you will have light!
1033073497 [8401] <pam/#webco> I'll ask the guys on the first floor for access tomorrow when the light bulbs show up

1033418120 [2087] <pam/#webco> adam: thanks
1033418518 [2101] <pam/#webco> adam: I don't see the journal report functionality on 2.0.10 that is spec'd for ucb, am I missing something or is it a bug?

1033594476 [7199] <pam/#webco> love the tester
1033594595 [7234] <pam/#webco> adam: ok
1033594607 [7236] <pam/#webco> adam:  is media suppsed to be able to have usage fees?
1033595218 [7260] <pam/#webco> adam:  is umich suppose to have usage fees?  It doesn't but hm.onsd/adam/wco does 
1033595241 [7267] <pam/#webco> good question
1033595412 [7269] <pam/#webco> where on projex would I find that? I have to read the spec?
1033595527 [7280] <pam/#webco> sorry, forgot that it's a module and not included
1033664778 [7762] <pam/#webco> hi all, thanks lee but no chickie for pam
1033665095 [7791] <pam/#webco> adam:  cool, UWisc install = $$
1033665142 [7797] <pam/#webco> two and a half
1033666311 [7876] <pam/#onshored> you say that because you don't have school
1033682147 [8485] <pam/#webco> penny talky talky oy
1033751529 [9509] <pam/#webco> happy friday - i'm soaking wet :(
1033754804 [9690] <pam/#webco> adam: on 2.1 there is an Operators tab on the org detail screen, it gets error but is this where you should be able to see all operators at once?
1033754885 [9702] <pam/#webco> adam: i'm going to file a bug on it anyway, cause if it is it's in the wrong place - operators are assigned to checkout centers, not orgs
1033754969 [9713] <pam/#webco> adam: but you assign them to checkout centers in the work flow
1033754992 [9717] <pam/#webco> yep
1033755014 [9719] <pam/#webco> typing faster than i'm reading
1033755660 [9733] <pam/#webco> yes
1033755675 [9737] <pam/#webco> looking at it
1033755701 [9743] <pam/#webco> yeah, I see it's in applet mode now
1033756191 [9749] <pam/#webco> dan is at lunch, spank him later
1033761888 [9826] <pam/#webco> adam: light purple bar with current allocation link is cut off on 2.1 demo
1033761953 [9833] <pam/#webco> yeah
1033761965 [9839] <pam/#webco> color blind?>
1033761992 [9841] <pam/#webco> also, some of the root resource types show up twice in applet
1033762046 [9843] <pam/#webco> cameras, three times, misc - twice and recorders - twice, file bug?
1033762063 [9852] <pam/#webco> they look like duplicates, they have the same resources listed under them
1033762829 [9886] <pam/#webco> adam:  ok, I see that now.  I'll file
1033765027 [9956] <pam/#webco> adam: filed blocker on 2.1 demo site
1033765041 [9958] <pam/#webco> #4408
1033765538 [10009] <pam/#webco> adam: yeah, I tested on dan's windows box and got the same behavior
1033766078 [10023] <pam/#webco> adam: yeah, the status bar all better
1033766396 [10031] <pam/#webco> hrm, nope, guess I should do that
1033766606 [10058] <pam/#webco> adam: art center? no official purchase as of yet, you need a job number for something you are doing?
1033767273 [10102] <pam/#webco> adam: Uportland, install 16059, import 16060, support 16061, training 16062
1033767297 [10107] <pam/#webco> adam: uw, install 16063, import 16064, support 16065
1033767315 [10109] <pam/#webco> adam: art center, proof of concept 16066
1034278068 [17857] <pam/#webco> josh: utah on phone, when do you want to upgrade them to 2.0.9.2?
1034284185 [18246] <pam/#webco> josh: I am going to call utah back, you can do upgrade tonight?
1034284248 [18260] <pam/#webco> cool
1034284533 [18291] <pam/#webco> josh: 7pm mountain time
1034373269 [20921] <pam/#webco> cbl: can be set at resource type, checkout center or org levels like any other policy
1034373708 [20925] <pam/#webco> cbl: I think their status would go back to available since the allocation would cancel so you could only find them if you knew what ck to look for, I think
1034621093 [22728] <pam/#webco> josh: amanda from utah just called me about the dirty little error she just sent in, do you have time to take a look at it?
1034621994 [22750] <pam/#webco> adam: any news on patron import for portland?  I need to call Beth so she may ask
1034622703 [22776] <pam/#webco> tomorrow for me too, I have class tonight
1034627789 [23025] <pam/#webco> one more to come, testing now
1034627798 [23027] <pam/#webco> dirty rsvp status
1034628819 [23072] <pam/#webco> josh: i just filed blocker on 2.0.10
1034632995 [23295] <pam/#webco> off to class i go
1034702068 [24119] <pam/#webco> hey hey
1034703981 [24143] <pam/#webco> josh:  do you think #4444 really has to wait until 2.1 to fix?  I think it's going to some serious frustration to users
1034704002 [24145] <pam/#webco> it did for me
1034704083 [24161] <pam/#webco> hrmph
1034706374 [24169] <pam/#webco> hmm, I've hit it a lot and so has Dan and Eric while doing demos but I haven't heard from any clients about it.  It wouldn't be so bad if it at least said why you were getting the error
1034706543 [24182] <pam/#webco> cbl: yes
1034706751 [24208] <pam/#webco> no
1034706817 [24210] <pam/#webco> cause it updates if you make a payment but doesn't if you waive a line item - behavior is not consistent
1034707298 [24245] <pam/#webco> cbl: I am getting different results if I waive the last item on the invoice, still says status pending, can we go over together?
1034707755 [24251] <pam/#webco> cbl: yes, that works better
1034719872 [24698] <pam/#webco> josh: we need to talk bug 4444 again
1034719907 [24703] <pam/#webco> Eric and Dan both hit this in demos today and it seems like it will be a problem
1034719938 [24709] <pam/#webco> adam: i tried to find that one and can't, what CK was it again?
1034719960 [24711] <pam/#webco> you said CK16 but I can't find that in beta
1034720166 [24723] <pam/#webco> I said in the bug I thought it was a date issue, i did a lot of testing and it is the only thing I could find 
1034720203 [24731] <pam/#webco> josh said it was a "hidden" override in his response on the bug
1034720253 [24742] <pam/#webco> maybe so
1034720370 [24755] <pam/#webco> well, I thought I had it narrowed down to a date issue because I would try to pick one up and get the error and if I changed the date to todays date and picked it up it would allow it
1034720549 [24807] <pam/#webco> I did just pick up a reservation for a future date too, shit
1034720567 [24817] <pam/#webco> I'll have to do some more testing on this and nail it down more
1034720594 [24819] <pam/#webco> yeah but I was looking for that yesterday when I was testing
1034720612 [24823] <pam/#webco> i know i made sure the resource had a status of available
1034720645 [24826] <pam/#webco> too much testing, brain melting
1034720761 [24836] <pam/#webco> I know that it does it on that and should, I need to do more testing, sigh
1034720790 [24845] <pam/#webco> ok, can we leave as is and I will fry my brain on it more and see what I can come up with
1034787946 [25462] <pam/#onshored> hi jk!  how are you?
1034788395 [25466] <pam/#webco> adam: did more testing on why i was getting cannot commit error
1034788412 [25470] <pam/#webco> i was wrong about the date thing but here is what is happening
1034788423 [25474] <pam/#webco> i don't know if it is a bug or not so I could use some input
1034788469 [25477] <pam/#webco> if you try to pick up a reservation and any resource on that ck is reservered on a differnt reservation that takes place earlier than the one you are trying to pick up you get the cannot commit error
1034788501 [25483] <pam/#webco> just bad ui cause there is no feedback about what is happening
1034788537 [25493] <pam/#webco> did it ever give that feedback or am I just catching this now?
1034788646 [25507] <pam/#webco> ok, I'll file bug w/o milestone
1034788660 [25509] <pam/#webco> tried demo, same behavior
1034788739 [25514] <pam/#webco> yeah, if a resource has status rsvp, can we have it listed under the resource on ck just like if it was out on one?
1034795310 [25609] <pam/#webco> cbl: i didn't see your question
1034795314 [25611] <pam/#webco> my irc crashed
1034795456 [25619] <pam/#webco> nothing
1034795582 [25626] <pam/#webco> cbl: ok, I'll take a look
1034795599 [25628] <pam/#webco> on what url?
1034795643 [25635] <pam/#webco> ok
1034796750 [25652] <pam/#webco> ok josh, but remember you asked me too ;)
1034796809 [25654] <pam/#webco> cbl:  #4103 still not quite right.  The total current charges is correct but ther is still a line that says current fees for unreturned items with a higher charge
1034796831 [25656] <pam/#webco> look at returned checkout ck8
1034797476 [25672] <pam/#webco> cbl: i don't think it belongs there at all, all of the items have been returned.  make a no sense
1034798734 [25754] <pam/#webco> josh: i am about to file a blocker on the demo, getting error trying to return any checkouts :( so sad
1034798761 [25764] <pam/#webco> cool
1034798764 [25770] <pam/#webco> demo
1034798778 [25776] <pam/#webco> demo, demo, demo
1034798970 [25797] <pam/#webco> josh: dan and gary about to do a demo
1034798997 [25805] <pam/#webco> i did, found in the nick of time
1034799010 [25809] <pam/#webco> how long does it take?
1034799019 [25813] <pam/#webco> no, wait
1034799040 [25821] <pam/#webco> true
1034799071 [25829] <pam/#webco> yeah they do
1034799218 [25838] <pam/#webco> don little funny
1034800484 [25858] <pam/#webco> josh: you asked for bugs you got one, and it's a blocker #4434
1034800504 [25860] <pam/#webco> i'm like the bug fairy
1034800766 [25877] <pam/#webco> sure, np
1034800786 [25881] <pam/#webco> josh: dan says you can upgrade demo now ifin you want
1034800862 [25887] <pam/#webco> josh: i need id and pw for strings
1034801081 [25897] <pam/#webco> ok
1034802093 [25901] <pam/#webco> josh: still buggy but a little better.  Status bar updates fine but confirmation page still displays resources being removed and resource being added.  It does, however, check the ww pin correctly and does all allow ww to confirm if resource doesn't require authorization
1034802136 [25907] <pam/#webco> the confirmation page
1034802155 [25912] <pam/#webco> yes
1034802288 [25931] <pam/#webco> yeah you're right, i never saw the (this resource is being removed) thing - doh
1034802309 [25939] <pam/#webco> so bug fixed, just not on beta
1034802351 [25953] <pam/#webco> don't celebrate too much, I'm going back to find more bugs.....
1034802451 [25960] <pam/#webco> josh: updating beta now?
1034802600 [25973] <pam/#webco> cool
1034805079 [26079] <pam/#webco> found a bug, weeeeeeee
1034805152 [26091] <pam/#webco> josh: i am putting 2.0.10 but you may want to put it off, you be the judge
1034805198 [26095] <pam/#webco> #4462, all yours
1034874809 [27121] <pam/#webco> hi

1036001563 [46424] <pam/#webco> adam: ok
1036003941 [46501] <pam/#webco> adam: i thought we were going to have the search presets on screens be "settable" in 2.1, could be in my imagination i guess
1036004032 [46509] <pam/#webco> if you remove say earliest start and latest start do do a search, when you return to that screen is remembers that you removed them and does not put it back
1036004144 [46515] <pam/#webco> adam: hm.onshored.com is hanging
1036004167 [46521] <pam/#webco> ok

1036103619 [48146] <pam/#webco> ok, so then after the partial will be another one
1036103698 [48160] <pam/#webco> ok, under the resource task you have listed that there needs to be mtg with customer, what has to happen in that mtg?
1036103707 [48162] <pam/#webco> adam: yes I can do a timeline

1036104144 [48262] <pam/#webco> cool
1036104178 [48272] <pam/#webco> ok, those were my only questions unless you had more to add
1036104218 [48284] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks adam
1036174699 [48796] <pam/#webco> adam: operator training can be done in about 4 hours, manager training can take about 6 because it encompasses operator and mgr training.  I also like to do about an hour follow up for each after they have had a chance to use the system and have more questions
1036174719 [48804] <pam/#webco> adam: i have done much shorter sessions if need be
1036174782 [48810] <pam/#onshored> hey kathleen! did you find a home for your kitty?

1036188511 [49664] <pam/#webco> dern
1036189659 [49719] <pam/#webco> question about departments:
1036189693 [49721] <pam/#webco> i was on the phone with uiuc and did a search for departments for them and came up with 180+ results even though they did not set them up, where did this come from?
1036189782 [49738] <pam/#webco> the best i can figure is they came from setting up people and listing their deparment on their detail
1036189799 [49746] <pam/#webco> i was in the find department form page so def. not orgs
1036189825 [49762] <pam/#webco> ok, will ask on monday
1036190309 [49815] <pam/#webco> yo ayres, did you see my question on department?
1036190463 [49821] <pam/#webco> um, migration made them, migration from what/where, when we upgraded to 2.0.10 it happened?
1036190502 [49824] <pam/#webco> how come version 2.0.10 is not listed in bugzilla
1036190650 [49844] <pam/#webco> ayres: ok, did that happen on upgrade, will it continue to happen, like if you enter a new person with a new department will it add to the list?
1036190892 [49859] <pam/#webco> wacky
1036191406 [49985] <pam/#onshored> hehe
1036435089 [50770] <pam/#webco> josh: looks like wheaton needs upgrade, hours of operation in projex
1036435258 [50793] <pam/#webco> i dunno, i thought it had been done week b/f last but I just checked and it is still 2.0.9.2

1036435333 [50804] <pam/#webco> josh: did you know i am out the rest of the week?

1037058767 [58555] <pam/#webco> cbl: question about patron integration
1037058810 [58561] <pam/#webco> cbl: yea
1037058870 [58573] <pam/#webco> if you have a patron who has a patron class undergrad and they are changed manually to operator, will the daily import rewrite the patron class back to undergrad?
1037059023 [58579] <pam/#webco> ok, well lets say a student at the university is also an operator, then how can his status go to operator?
1037059264 [58613] <pam/#webco> cbl: forget about my question, i figured it out, thanks though
1037124761 [59081] <pam/#webco> adam: if a client wants to change some of the wording on email can we do that without charge or do we need to quote them for it?
1037127655 [59200] <pam/#webco> josh:  denver wants to know where on their server the email templates are, I don't know :0
1037128185 [59272] <pam/#webco> thanks all, i'll let denver know
1037128292 [59292] <pam/#webco> josh: yep
1037130816 [59542] <pam/#webco> pam causes double booking at gordon
1037130870 [59546] <pam/#webco> i thought it would be fun
1037130889 [59551] <pam/#webco> how close are you to getting the formula for causing it?
1037131000 [59584] <pam/#webco> yeah, CK 2513 and CK2516 conflict, cancel 2516 please
1037131015 [59588] <pam/#webco> i got an error but it still committed behind the scenes, did you know it was doing that?
1037131056 [59595] <pam/#webco> it didn't give me the confirmation page, it said error, cannont commit but then I went to resource detail and there it was listed as the next reservation and in conflict with the current one
1037131111 [59603] <pam/#webco> Cannon GL-1 - #3 (Soft Case) and it is still listed as available
1037131643 [59650] <pam/#webco> josh: werid though cuz i still never got a confirmation screen b/c i was trying to make a conflict,just gave me errors, somehow the system moved the time bar back to an acceptable time and then committed w/o letting me know???? oh weird indeed
1037131790 [59666] <pam/#webco> yeah, but it wasn't in the applet, it let me move the bars over a yellow reserved time without pulling it back like it normally would, then I hit commit and then got the error
1037131850 [59670] <pam/#webco> i will play with it some more on demo and let you know if i can recreate
1037131949 [59687] <pam/#webco> but without a confirmation page?
1037135364 [59779] <pam/#webco> josh: no, they are due by the 14th and I spoke to them yesterday and they say they should have them to us by then no problem
1037135411 [59787] <pam/#webco> nah

1037221075 [61243] <pam/#webco> josh: can patron import be logged under the patron drop file?
1037221197 [61257] <pam/#webco> ok
1037221344 [61264] <pam/#webco> they are usually put together so we can do that i think
1037221876 [61315] <pam/#webco> josh: yes to putting launches under pmgt
1037224178 [61535] <pam/#webco> does anyone know who gets mail to sysadmin@onshored.com?

1037309857 [63720] <pam/#webco> adam: there is no way to remove the checkout center box from the find reservation screen so there is no work around for that one

1038006788 [7957] <pam/#webco> josh: on phone with accd, what character do they need to add in front of the inches sign?  sorry, i forget

1038256302 [8318] <pam/#webco> josh: is the already set up artcenter site ok to use as their production site for the next four months?
1038256576 [8330] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1038256590 [8334] <pam/#webco> do you think you may take a swing at the accd resources today?

1038256652 [8354] <pam/#webco> say 4pm?
1038256662 [8360] <pam/#webco> tanks
1038257474 [8380] <pam/#webco> hmmm, i will work with them.  maybe we can create root types in the interface and move the 282 into them and avoid another import
1038262593 [8461] <pam/#webco> josh: saic is down, can you restart please?
1038331774 [9175] <pam/#webco> good snowy morning!
1038331830 [9188] <pam/#webco> josh: where is the earliest and latest start times default managed at?  UCB has a very big search by default and they want to change it
1038331869 [9194] <pam/#webco> yeah
1038331889 [9198] <pam/#webco> really?? huh, never would have thought of that
1038333827 [9418] <pam/#webco> every computer i touch today crashes :(
1038335589 [9562] <pam/#onshored> i went to robert morris for a couple of semesters, what is she teaching?
1038335615 [9566] <pam/#onshored> the students there can be quite a hand full sometimes! 
1038335632 [9568] <pam/#onshored> they complain A LOT about any amount of work
1038335639 [9570] <pam/#onshored> it was kind of weird
1038335658 [9574] <pam/#onshored> oh, cool
1038335717 [9583] <pam/#onshored> yeah, i was always amazed by what some of the students there could handle, full time job, 3 or 4 classes and a couple of kids!!  and then others would complain about the smallest requirements
1038335757 [9597] <pam/#onshored> and pay thousands of $$$
1038335782 [9604] <pam/#onshored> the nerve
1038352513 [10616] <pam/#webco> josh: in case you didn't notice I missed our 4pm mtg, can we reschedule for tomorrow?
1038352825 [10651] <pam/#webco> josh: if i have time tomorrow i will put all my questions/concerns and needed updates to projex in an email to you and we can discuss client status in that format this time, ok?
1038356740 [10889] <pam/#webco> adam: do you know what was decided to do for concordia resource swap, are we going to follow the original spec or the larger one?  do we have any idea on deliverable dates for it?
1038357194 [10900] <pam/#webco> don't know. I know dan spoke to them before he left but didn't get an answer
1038357239 [10905] <pam/#webco> i was on a call with concordia today and he mentioned that is was really needed for them but I think dan sold it with them knowing it was not in production yet, at least i hope so *sigh*
1038357331 [10916] <pam/#webco> i am sure he was too but you know how sometimes clients hear what they want to hear
1038357443 [10935] <pam/#webco> ok, as long as I have some idea of where it sits when they ask, cool module = more money :)
1038357522 [10948] <pam/#webco> yeah, all those little 2-3 k's add up
1038357699 [10974] <pam/#webco> any idea why artcenter.webcheckout.net now says Worlds most exciting index page! ??
1038357711 [10978] <pam/#webco> maybe, i'll go look and see where it is now
1038357747 [10988] <pam/#webco> hmm, maybe i am imagining that i filed it
1038357768 [10990] <pam/#webco> it was a while ago
1038357838 [10994] <pam/#webco> i didn't see it on the release notes
1038357878 [11003] <pam/#webco> adam: ok
1038357885 [11005] <pam/#webco> and thanks
1038357971 [11013] <pam/#webco> adam: would that have caused the password to artcenter to change?
1038358103 [11038] <pam/#webco> hmm, no point if their data is gone, i'll check in with josh in the morning
1038358296 [11061] <pam/#webco> adam: oh, i misunderstood you then
1038358303 [11063] <pam/#webco> adam: bug already filed
1038358305 [11065] <pam/#webco> bug 4461
1038358313 [11070] <pam/#webco> not milestoned
1038358361 [11075] <pam/#webco> i haven't tested it on 3.0 line, let me check if it occurs there first
1038358498 [11099] <pam/#webco> well, the work around is to look at the small print, a resource will say it is reserved on another CK in the contents list so it is not a big issue
1038358767 [11105] <pam/#webco> ok, put on 3.0
1038358769 [11108] <pam/#webco> i go home now
1038418736 [11746] <pam/#webco> does craig B smoke?
1038418767 [11757] <pam/#webco> cigarettes, i don't want to know anything else!
1038418779 [11764] <pam/#webco> cool

1038421655 [11930] <pam/#webco> trying to pull or resource types
1038421691 [11946] <pam/#webco> yeah i know, but it has been a looonnngg time. like two min and still nothing
1038421722 [11955] <pam/#webco> yeah, they do, we are already working on that
1038421748 [11959] <pam/#webco> nothing, i just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else slowing it down
1038428094 [12241] <pam/#webco> josh: i just wanted to go over client status and give you some updates to projex, i think it can wait or i'll send you an email
1038428233 [12253] <pam/#webco> oh yeah, no worky on friday :)
1038435231 [12777] <pam/#webco> i'm trying to make a checkout on beta.  once i hit commit button all i get is the commit failed: waiting for network to requests.  is this a bug?

1038867784 [13760] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1038868724 [13806] <pam/#webco> saic is down, help help says alex
1038868850 [13814] <pam/#webco> so how hard would it be to have the agreement forms and invoices print the resouce type AND the resource ID on 3.0?  everyone complains about just having the ID
1038869030 [13842] <pam/#webco> sorry lee, but thanks
1038869263 [13850] <pam/#webco> if a bug is milestoned for 3.0.x then it is not set to be fixed b/f 3.0 release, right?
1038869315 [13862] <pam/#webco> ok, i am going to move one to 3.0, you can kick it back if you want 
1038869552 [13873] <pam/#webco> yeah
1038869631 [13877] <pam/#onshored> cbl: do you know why components would be missing from beta then?
1038869970 [13887] <pam/#onshored> josh: for instance, on demo resource m-89-le contains two resources, but on beta it doesn't 
1038870474 [13900] <pam/#onshored> just doing some testing, i needed a break from eveything else but i can stop ifyou need to upgrade

1038937865 [14326] <pam/#webco> lee: on beta, i tried to return a reservation and got same error
1038937915 [14330] <pam/#webco> i was playing around with renew some feature yesterday before i tried to return any allocations, i don't know if that is related or not
1038938177 [14373] <pam/#webco> if you want to reload beta I can try to break again and give you more details about what I did, if that helps
1038938254 [14378] <pam/#webco> why?  isn't it just for testing currently?

1039043254 [16203] <pam/#webco> but i filed a 3.0 bug to finish my day!
1039111205 [16889] <pam/#webco> hey hey
1039113342 [16923] <pam/#webco> josh: did you update beta last night?
1039119768 [17106] <pam/#webco> josh: do you know what is up with sfsu? i would like to give laurie a call but it looks like their server is still down, what did their it guy have to say?
1039120174 [17132] <pam/#webco> oh, so we havn't reinstalled yet then
1039120222 [17143] <pam/#webco> yeah, i didn't really know though, i assumed
1039120291 [17157] <pam/#webco> ok, i'll give laurie a call and see if she wants to put pressure on her great IT guy from her end
1039127007 [17406] <pam/#webco> josh: i forgot i have an appointment in the morning and I don't know how long it will take so I may be a little late tomorrow
1039127050 [17413] <pam/#webco> thanks, phew
1039127075 [17422] <pam/#webco> i know, i was afraid to tell you
1039127146 [17425] <pam/#webco> is there a big reason why we can't update beta until after 5?
1039127548 [17437] <pam/#webco> "our testers" (meaning me) would really appreciate it if you would update it ;)
1039127636 [17441] <pam/#webco> adam: i logged into utexas.net and it doesn't look like they have made any attempt to enter media stuff yet, are you aware of any problems from them?
1039127651 [17443] <pam/#webco> should i try to get them moving on that
1039127713 [17447] <pam/#webco> tanks
1039127847 [17455] <pam/#webco> i see the part where we should make sure he is entering, i can contact him to see what is up since it doesn't look like they are
1039127872 [17457] <pam/#webco> are they planning on entering all their media by hand or are we migrating from another source
1039127925 [17461] <pam/#webco> cool
1039127929 [17463] <pam/#webco> you rock
1039128359 [17468] <pam/#webco> would that update include a fix lee did on bug 4593 yesterday?
1039128556 [17478] <pam/#webco> lee_pad: can you confirm if that fix for 4593 was checked in?
1039129351 [17484] <pam/#webco> adam: ok, thanks, i'
1039129468 [17493] <pam/#webco> i did a search on the media tab and nothing came up
1039129930 [17520] <pam/#webco> sorry, i didn't milestone them, i did say i was on beta in them though, i thought
1039129974 [17530] <pam/#webco> i'll go back and fix
1039130030 [17535] <pam/#webco> hmm, getting same error so i'm gonna reopen it
1039130103 [17546] <pam/#webco> josh did it about half hour ago
1039130141 [17550] <pam/#webco> adam: why would repeating reservations being broken not be a blocker, i know i get confused on the meaning of blocker sometimes
1039130272 [17566] <pam/#webco> ahh, ok
1039130673 [17575] <pam/#webco> lee_pad: error came up on beta when returning checkouts
1039130709 [17577] <pam/#webco> ok, i gotta go

1039202682 [18297] <pam/#webco> josh: did you get a chance to look at the Gordon error that came in this morning?  it looks like the same thing that came in yesertday from a couple of clients, maybe cbl can handle it?

1040061395 [9380] <pam/#webco> la is nutty
1040061435 [9388] <pam/#webco> it went well, i am soooo sick of webcheckout
1040064682 [9622] <pam/#webco> cbl: can we check the accd drop file and make sure it is running properly.  When I was training on wed there were 3500 patrons, now there are only 2400, just want to make sure it is not something on our end
1040064709 [9635] <pam/#webco> thanks
1040066642 [9733] <pam/#webco> cbl: no, they didn't say anything, I noticed the drop and wanted to check it out.  thanks
1040234373 [12899] <pam/#webco> hey hey
1040237326 [13140] <pam/#webco> josh: fyi, i moved my 130 mtg so I can do the whole bugzilla training thing and I won't bug you :) I know, you love me

1040243814 [13414] <pam/#webco> thanks josh
1040250816 [13705] <pam/#webco> josh: having trouble reaching alpa:5050 now, help pls
1040256008 [14199] <pam/#webco> josh: both uri and ucla need to be updated, i'm going to add that to the todo list :) both are running 2.0.8 still
1040256021 [14205] <pam/#webco> tornado watch in mid december - weird
1040318527 [1541] <pam/#webco> morning
1040318567 [1545] <pam/#webco> josh: denver has the same problem that jhu had about auto-circulate reservations cancelling at the grace period time :( i'm going to log it 
1040318664 [1547] <pam/#webco> should I log a new bug or open the old one and change it to denver?
1040319751 [1598] <pam/#webco> josh: it looks like the bug was never fixed for Utah (not jhu like i thought)  so I am going to add Denver to the bug #4568 but it is pretty critical for denver because it is keeping them from doing billing
1040322386 [1694] <pam/#webco> josh: uri asked to be upgraded either on the 23rd or 24th.  I think you are out on those days and I would like to suggest to them that we do it sometime this weekend, what do you think?
1040322419 [1699] <pam/#webco> cool

1041957382 [16768] <pam/#webco> ayres: we didn't see the same kind of lag in response when you and I were working together, it does deserve some more testing but you can close if for now until I get a chance to revisit it
1041958473 [16810] <pam/#webco> adam: do you think you would have some time on monday or tuesday to have a mtg with Rick from ACCD to nail down the specifics of the enhancement requests so we can get them a quote?

1041958785 [16821] <pam/#webco> criagb: there is nothing for you to do with Administaff to come back on, just stuff for me to do so you don't need to hunt be down, unless you just missed me and want to say hi
1041959013 [16832] <pam/#webco> adam: is there a time that works well for you?
1041961261 [16887] <pam/#webco> josh: i just forwarded an email to support from concordia about patron import file structure, can you advise please?

1042495183 [26483] <pam/#webco> we gave accd a new ftp address but they can't get to it, should they just send the file to the old one until we can get it worked out?
1042495229 [26498] <pam/#webco> nesta: i read it to them over and over and had them retype it plus gary is standing there so i wuold hope they were getting it right but you never really know... 
1042495255 [26516] <pam/#webco> can we move onto the ftp question please
1042495319 [26532] <pam/#webco> adam gave them a new ftp address with the same passwords but they can't get to it, they are sending email to support because of course they sent it to the wrong place but until we can get that worked out will their import run tonight using the old info?
1042495458 [26547] <pam/#webco> oy, they are going send email so we can get it worked out that way
1042496717 [26568] <pam/#webco> josh:  accd email regarding ftp came in, can i get your opinion on that?

1043435325 [44652] <pam/#webco> i saw it once the other day during testing but I was logged in as with just the capability to modify reservations, once i gave myself capability to perform checkouts and reservations it went away so I thought it was related to that
1043435410 [44662] <pam/#webco> i'm gonna ask scott some follow up questions unless you have any idea what this might be related to
1043436797 [44709] <pam/#webco> adam is at that conf thing today right?

1043446960 [45145] <pam/#webco> nesta: spoke to sara again.  Their sem. start date says 5/28/02 and the end date is 8/15/02 and there is already an existing bug about those dates not appearing to do anything, such as gather usage stats
1043446980 [45147] <pam/#webco> not sure it would be related to this current bug
1043447032 [45151] <pam/#webco> i think monday is the start of their quarter so she is hoping this can get looked at over the weekend

1043960383 [51861] <pam/#webco> i can go and retest all of their issues on beta and then figure out what we can put off for them or what they can't live without
1043960419 [51870] <pam/#webco> just give me a min to go over them please, i'm trying to keep up with 14 things at once here
1043960517 [51879] <pam/#webco> adam: don't remilestone them or close them yet, give me a little time to review them.  I don't want to make a snap decision where accd is concerned
1043960532 [51888] <pam/#webco> i'm not planning on asking them, i would like to review them myself and test
1043962723 [51975] <pam/#webco> where the bloop is ups
1043964951 [52054] <pam/#webco> cbl: I had the wrong ss# in my file, i misread your tax form, i'll get a corrected form for you
1043965224 [52088] <pam/#webco> adam: talked to dan about accd and we agree that we can push the bugs to 3.0.  I am not convinced that bug #4829 is version specific
1043965226 [52090] <pam/#webco> i will remilestone
1043965272 [52101] <pam/#webco> already did, two are fixed, one is still a bug that needs more detail from tester (me)
1043967427 [52333] <pam/#webco> cbl: i put the slowness i got in the bug but maybe we should coordinate a couple of us to work on it at once and see what happens
1043967438 [52335] <pam/#webco> josh: get back to work, you get nothing
1043967488 [52343] <pam/#webco> how about now?  me, you and eric and dan if they can?

1043969452 [52472] <pam/#webco> i also pulled up that same order and did an Edit reservation and it took 135 seconds for the applet to load all the resources
1043969706 [52474] <pam/#webco> cbl: do you need more?
1043973467 [52483] <pam/#webco> me too

1044291472 [54547] <pam/#onshored> gracchus: great, let me know if you need anything else.  Did you get the change form sent to Administaff?
1044295172 [54665] <pam/#webco> cbl: do you have a status on accd printing?

1044478114 [2744] <pam/#webco> hm, yeah you are correct, I just assumed one
1044478141 [2748] <pam/#webco> i don't see any home location info in his system, wonder if that was in his import
1044478151 [2750] <pam/#webco> yeah, that's what i figured
1044478168 [2758] <pam/#webco> but it is part of the import?

1044917207 [9179] <pam/#webco> ooohh, he will, in more ways than one
1044917412 [9202] <pam/#webco> sometimes if it is too messy they won't bother, i should be a bigger slob
1044917550 [9218] <pam/#webco> ouch, blood change
1044917717 [9226] <pam/#webco> we have a spot on the patron detail page for Academic level and no place to enter or edit it
1044917721 [9228] <pam/#webco> silly webcheckout
1044917855 [9236] <pam/#webco> ahhh, can we set it up to take info from accd patron drop file if they need same info?
1044917905 [9240] <pam/#webco> how bout in practice
1044917977 [9252] <pam/#webco> no, cbl
1044917992 [9256] <pam/#webco> coolio
1044918191 [9291] <pam/#webco> craig: ok
1044918199 [9293] <pam/#webco> gary: i have a meeting with them shortly
1044918410 [9299] <pam/#webco> maybe, I will be talking to them shortly, just wanted to make sure it was doable before telling them
1044918569 [9309] <pam/#webco> in the file that they send you mean, there is nothing that cooresponds to it?
1044918649 [9317] <pam/#webco> is deparment?
1044985981 [10645] <pam/#webco> josh: I was going to reply to Alberto and Dan email unless  you alredy did
1044986042 [10649] <pam/#webco> ??
1044986092 [10653] <pam/#webco> i don't understand, I am talking about the email dan sent to support cc'ing alberto
1044986207 [10682] <pam/#webco> yeah, I am going to explain how renew works and then ask him the purpose of needing it to remove resources from current checkout, after he replies we will explain to him how he is crazy to want such a thing
1044986245 [10686] <pam/#webco> oh, i see his second email now, didn't see it at first
1044986296 [10697] <pam/#webco> yeah, i don't understand why any one would want to remove a resource from a current checkout
1044986340 [10703] <pam/#webco> yeah, or if you want to use one reservation you can always renew to add a resource and then return the one item you want to off of it
1044987269 [10719] <pam/#webco> josh: trying to log onto LCC on gopher and it is coming back with connection failure.  Did we change their url from gopher.onshored.com/lansing/wco/?
1044987324 [10721] <pam/#webco> never mind just went through
1044987801 [10728] <pam/#webco> i have a mtg with them tomorrow afternoon to follow up on their status, the changes we made last week and to meet with Airdri and Richard about the problems they are having with fees

1044988288 [10756] <pam/#webco> adam: havn't had a chance to go back and look at them yet, i was at UCLA all thur and friday, it's on my to do list for today
1044988566 [10772] <pam/#webco> adam: maybe i am missing something in the process here.  So these changes that were made to their 2.0.11.1 instance should be staged, we tell to go take a look and let us know if that is what they want?  I am not sure if they were just patched to their instance or not, all the notes on the bugs just say fixed
1044991737 [10837] <pam/#webco> ayres: do you think you can patch ucb bug #4936 to their 2.0.11.1 instance?  
1044992482 [10910] <pam/#webco> adam: i thought i understood the process but it would be helpful if you would just write it up so it's clear
1044993273 [10942] <pam/#webco> ayres: give a couple min pls
1044994468 [10977] <pam/#webco> craig: so the accd sever is moving tomorrow morning?  are we giving their IT people enough time to make the change to their printing ip setup?
1044996167 [11035] <pam/#webco> craig: art center opens at 8am to faculty, is the hour between 7 and 8 enough to make sure the server is moved and up?
1044996183 [11037] <pam/#webco> do we need to maybe do it at 8 our time?
1044996217 [11043] <pam/#webco> ok
1044996615 [11072] <pam/#webco> cbl: I just forwarded an email to support about some trouble with ACCD patron drop file, can you look when you get a chance pls?
1044999153 [11288] <pam/#webco> craig: i don't think eric had a phone yet

1045006315 [12000] <pam/#webco> time to run payroll, craig who?
1045006465 [12039] <pam/#webco> sure, we should give eric the saic line, he said

1045071584 [12705] <pam/#webco> i think so
1045071631 [12707] <pam/#webco> you email came through but both janie @uri and joel @usc said they sent me mail that bounced back
1045071645 [12711] <pam/#webco> joel's i think was just to me
1045071915 [12729] <pam/#webco> i am going to try to make changes to the documentation, it's a time issue
1045072002 [12736] <pam/#webco> i have so many hats i can't get my head in the door any more
1045072168 [12752] <pam/#webco> yeah, i'm going to start putting in a couple extra hours in from home to try and start updating the docs.  The release notes will really help though, so cheers to lee!!

1045075380 [13061] <pam/#webco> ayres: do you have a few min. to reveiw a ucb issue with me?

1045076947 [13109] <pam/#webco> adam: i have mtg with ucb at 330 today, do you feel the need to be there?
1045077008 [13113] <pam/#webco> i can handle it, there are probably going to be a couple more isses they need fixed on their instance though
1045077041 [13127] <pam/#webco> josh: ok, i'll follow up on that
1045077206 [13133] <pam/#webco> ok
1045077707 [13163] <pam/#webco> ayres: all done, thanks
1045077755 [13169] <pam/#webco> adam: I think the meeting will be fine, is it ok to file the 2.0.11.1 milestoned bugs for them if I think it is appropriate?
1045078002 [13199] <pam/#webco> josh: yeah, i know but i meant milestoning to 2.0.x poop
1045078017 [13204] <pam/#webco> k
1045078149 [13218] <pam/#webco> well they sent a list of 8 issues and out of that there are 2 of them that I can see do cause problems that I dont' see a decent workaround for
1045078185 [13224] <pam/#webco> ayres: what kind of distinction outside of bugzilla do you mean?
1045078330 [13246] <pam/#webco> josh gets a new hat that says "Enforcer"

1045080624 [13290] <pam/#webco> josh: did you see email from accd about reporting tool?  I am going to answer with current version can use ODBC and point him to our docs on it but I don't fully underrstand the tool or how we work with it, is it ok just to tell him to read docs?

1045080697 [13309] <pam/#webco> reporting alternatives

1045089832 [14061] <pam/#webco> adam: ucb meeting when well, fyi
1045089854 [14067] <pam/#webco> si
1045089947 [14071] <pam/#webco> cbl: uh, I think accd sent an email a long time ago to re-int their patron file
1045089966 [14075] <pam/#webco> cbl: it hasn't been running this whole time?
1045090079 [14079] <pam/#webco> cbl: accd sent request to process patron file as normal as of 1/16
1045090220 [14119] <pam/#webco> cbl: i wish you had checked with me before sending that email :(
1045090286 [14126] <pam/#webco> if he is going to communicate with the client he should be up to date on their status, so is it a projex issue?
1045090406 [14163] <pam/#webco> those further instrux came, via communication with adam/support and it was never turned back on
1045090420 [14165] <pam/#webco> it's hard for adam too though being here and there
1045090425 [14167] <pam/#webco> i should have followed up too
1045090445 [14176] <pam/#webco> we just get their patron file drop running
1045090454 [14181] <pam/#webco> and let them know to check the data
1045090662 [14200] <pam/#webco> cbl: we can leave it at the email you sent and let them come back with "but we told you" if they do.  I didn't mean to sound harsh, irc has no inflection, it's a totally managable issue
1045090722 [14208] <pam/#webco> irc lessons from craig, priceless
1045090807 [14243] <pam/#webco> josh: scary email from wheaton just came in, can you take a look

1045158358 [15852] <pam/#webco> yo yo
1045158372 [15854] <pam/#webco> i miss my bed already
1045158606 [15876] <pam/#webco> craig: it was on UCB instance and it is a display issue, I haven't noticed anything like it on beta
1045159104 [15894] <pam/#webco> cbl: I just forwarded an email from Victor at ACCD to support, can you take a look pls
1045159115 [15898] <pam/#webco> thx
1045159237 [15904] <pam/#webco> ayres: on bug #4972 I noticed that you changed the milestone to 3.0 but ucb does need this to work on thier 2.0.11.1 instance in order to properly run invoice reports
1045159312 [15915] <pam/#webco> ayres: myabe but i get confused about head, branch, what that means blah blah
1045159335 [15922] <pam/#webco> great, thx
1045159384 [15932] <pam/#webco> thank you
1045159691 [15979] <pam/#webco> cbl: do you mind replying directly to victor since I don't really understand the issue?
1045159712 [15994] <pam/#webco> no, josh is good too
1045159723 [16000] <pam/#webco> word
1045159747 [16004] <pam/#webco> heh
1045161953 [16139] <pam/#webco> ayres: i am in ucb instance and was on phone with Richard with a nasty bug i can't figure out, do you have a min?
1045161985 [16147] <pam/#webco> do you mind coming up?
1045161991 [16149] <pam/#webco> yeah, please
1045164756 [16260] <pam/#webco> yeah, bug #4987
1045164767 [16267] <pam/#webco> didn't milestone it though
1045164844 [16282] <pam/#webco> well, it is really ugly, if we can fix it we should.  I couldn't figure out any way to get the task completed 
1045165168 [16319] <pam/#webco> well, I can ask Richard to cancel these and reenter them but if it comes up again we really have to do something, they think the application is very unstable because random, very frustrating things like this creep up for them a lot
1045165212 [16327] <pam/#webco> how do we know how ucb customization code is going to run on 3.0?
1045165326 [16350] <pam/#webco> craig: the only work around is to cancel existing reservation and re-enter all the data
1045165333 [16356] <pam/#webco> not really acceptable or easy
1045165371 [16366] <pam/#webco> well, in this case there are 5 resource, set strike info, account code info, etc
1045166148 [16422] <pam/#webco> cbl: can you do a mtg with LCC tomorrow at 130 to discuss their patron drop file?
1045166567 [16426] <pam/#webco> great
1045166656 [16442] <pam/#webco> covad in the house
1045166857 [16482] <pam/#webco> ayres: yes
1045166906 [16494] <pam/#webco> ayres: that is because I am a dodo and did not put the correct ck numbers in there
1045166923 [16502] <pam/#webco> hold on, i'll find them
1045167018 [16508] <pam/#webco> ok, good, sorry
1045167156 [16534] <pam/#webco> ayres: that is the deliver to location that Richard and I were trying to type back into the allocation cause when we pulled it up it said None
1045167461 [16540] <pam/#webco> i just change the date to 3/13/03 and left time alone, not the real date, just trying to get it to accept anything
1045167509 [16544] <pam/#webco> shit, is this just me not seeing the allocation times take place after the return online time
1045167528 [16548] <pam/#webco> ok
1045167684 [16552] <pam/#webco> ayres: I just checked, that first section is me being an idiot, sorry, I am trying to cut back on my morning caffeine and it's not working very well for me
1045167946 [16562] <pam/#webco> ayres: wait, there is still an problem becuase it won't commit taking the resource offline
1045167975 [16566] <pam/#webco> gives a cannot commit allocation with errors on the resource detail screen
1045168001 [16569] <pam/#webco> i'm going to add to the bug
1045168228 [16583] <pam/#webco> ayres: ok, I updated the bug, but just walk through the proces of taking that resource offline for repair, set return date before any fo the existing reservations, commit to take offline and see if you get the allocations error
1045171747 [16720] <pam/#webco> how weird would it be for 3.0 concordia to missing the created field on the confirmtion screen but beta has it
1045171766 [16722] <pam/#webco> i mean the created at: time field
1045171849 [16729] <pam/#webco> hm, well that's a weird one then cause it is missing
1045171939 [16743] <pam/#webco> i've checked several and don't see it
1045172122 [16762] <pam/#webco> i just found an ugly bug on concordia, ick

1045179376 [17000] <pam/#webco> craig: i think we can convince them to just use the invoice creation time to check fees no problem
1045179488 [17016] <pam/#webco> that's fine craig, no need to add in something that is not being demanded
1045244484 [17546] <pam/#webco> oh sure craig stop the story right at the part where I kick your ass, there's no shame in gettin beat up by a girl
1045246713 [17722] <pam/#webco> cbl: oh, I didn't notice that, so it must be an issue of reservations not becomeing cancelled reservations past their due back date

1046978515 [2195] <pam/#webco> nesta_pad: yeah, I know with a fine, but no way without assessing a fine.  Like if a patron is just a bad person and you want him to repent before using the equipment again but with no money involved?
1046979232 [2236] <pam/#webco> i filed an enhancement bug for it
1046979697 [2244] <pam/#webco> nesta_pad: is our dsl service on a specific phone line, one of our numbers?
1046979756 [2262] <pam/#webco> i don't know, I am trying to get good long distance rates and it seems cheaper to swith from ameritech to at&t but I don't want it to disrupt our dsl in any way and she asked me which line the dsl was coming on 
1046979763 [2267] <pam/#webco> ok, good, distinct is good
1046979770 [2269] <pam/#webco> thanks
1046981283 [2410] <pam/#webco> josh: did you get micheal at wheaton's email about container node error and email from yesterday? I don't see it and I they are issues out of my little world
1046982345 [2467] <pam/#webco> ok, I didn't even know there was a support action milestone, cool
1046986141 [2554] <pam/#webco> can beta get an update tonight?
1046986163 [2558] <pam/#webco> i need to call ufl but can't until the fixes lee made are in place
1046987100 [2575] <pam/#webco> thx
1046989418 [2703] <pam/#webco> none of the Add Search Term fields work on the contention report, they all act in the exact same manner, would you prefer one bug for all or seperate bug for each field?
1046989715 [2707] <pam/#webco> k
1046990935 [2732] <pam/#onshored> hey kristine!

1047060728 [3577] <pam/#webco> craig: on phone with evergreen, dave c
1047060748 [3579] <pam/#webco> he says you talked to a guy on their IT staff to set up the correct IP to get through their firewall
1047060764 [3581] <pam/#webco> after our changes, did you ever follow up with that guy?  I can not reach their instance
1047060784 [3587] <pam/#webco> dave is under the impression that you were going to follow up
1047060820 [3597] <pam/#webco> yes
1047060879 [3612] <pam/#webco> ok, dave crampton is contacting dave metzler
1047060892 [3616] <pam/#webco> 192.211.26.10
1047060942 [3620] <pam/#webco> yeah, me neither
1047061012 [3624] <pam/#webco> k, thanks
1047061205 [3642] <pam/#webco> boss and admin log in to beta not working
1047061211 [3644] <pam/#webco> :(

1047063531 [3782] <pam/#webco> cbl: billing starts with our friend dan
1047066966 [3853] <pam/#webco> cbl: dan is 117 but he is on the phone right now
1047067806 [3923] <pam/#webco> josh or cbl: do you think there will be some time next week to do the performance profile for evergreen that we ran for usc?
1047067922 [3927] <pam/#webco> should I file a bug for it?
1047068507 [3998] <pam/#webco> utexas claims they are going to start entering their media stuff into utexas.webcheckout.net next week, can we update that instance, I don't think it has been done for a while
1047068523 [4006] <pam/#webco> brian O is stink bomb
1047068594 [4017] <pam/#webco> criag: there is no data at all on utex.wb.net, they haven't done a thing yet so I don't know if what you are asking applies, maybe I just don't understand
1047068621 [4023] <pam/#webco> why does that matter? he wouldn't say
1047068694 [4039] <pam/#webco> he's not going to do it monday, this site has been there for quite some time and we have told him just to start entering, so why now would that change
1047068723 [4043] <pam/#webco> adam told them that
1047068786 [4058] <pam/#webco> ok, well brian otnes has many bugs up his butt, he really is not going to do anything before tuesday or wed.  he acts like I am inconveniencing him by getting this set up for him
1047068898 [4078] <pam/#webco> craig: i think that is fine.  Brian was like "well maybe we'll get to it next week, maybe the week after so I think if we could just work it into the schedule to get it done is fine
1047068911 [4084] <pam/#webco> you hope ;)
1047068926 [4086] <pam/#webco> i didn't make no promises to the stinkin poop head
1047068954 [4096] <pam/#webco> ok

1047321173 [5096] <pam/#webco> josh: yeah, it doesn't matter tho
1047322062 [5098] <pam/#webco> craig: do we have a modem name and model number for our dsl, I am filling out the rebate form
1047331656 [5466] <pam/#webco> cbl: what should I tell accd? That as far as we can tell it's up and they need to contact thier sysadmin?

1047420155 [8932] <pam/#webco> ayres: no need for 2.1 demo, take is away
1047420181 [8943] <pam/#webco> great, thanks
1047420188 [8945] <pam/#webco> none that I can think of 
1047423414 [9463] <pam/#webco> ayres: no, they did nothing to utexas.w.n, no additions at all, just reload their current data 
1047499592 [11307] <pam/#webco> josh/cbl: are we going to be able to get to the evergreen performance stuff this week?
1047499676 [11317] <pam/#webco> oh yeah, sorry, spaced on the router issue with them
1047499735 [11324] <pam/#webco> yeah, I know, I asked him the day before and on friday :)  but he keeps sending us stuff

1047664953 [15405] <pam/#webco> hi
1047664957 [15407] <pam/#webco> damn it's nice out today
1047666416 [15716] <pam/#webco> adam: I responded to the accd patron class email yesterday and I need further input from you please
1047666430 [15722] <pam/#webco> I would also like to discuss the idea of using academic level again
1047666449 [15726] <pam/#webco> I have given it some thought and I don't think this should be taken out of the Patron class detail
1047666462 [15729] <pam/#webco> but there should be some way that users can enter the information
1047671857 [15936] <pam/#webco> pins are still buggin  in 3.0 :(
1047671975 [15974] <pam/#webco> yep, trying to make some chgs in operator cap. and ever time I make chg, enter pin, system takes me back to org. detail screen w/o mkg chg
1047672169 [15988] <pam/#webco> beta
1047672339 [16027] <pam/#webco> craig: I go to operation detail screen, click on Manage Operators, ask for pin, I give it and it takes me to the correct screen.  I choose the operator I need to make a chg to, takes me to their detail screen, I make change and then hit button to save, asks for my pin again, then takes me back to the Operators tab in the org detail w/o making any change or giving any error
1047673116 [16179] <pam/#webco> craig: great, thanks for looking into it.  Can we get a beta update then?
1047677254 [16786] <pam/#webco> if accd moves their server to their campus will they see an improvement in application speed?
1047920114 [17856] <pam/#webco> good morning!  damn, lets go to the beach!
1047926256 [18010] <pam/#webco> yes, i will get you the number

1047926386 [18017] <pam/#webco> ayres: there is a migration bug on ucb test instance.  their resource hierarchy came in F-U-N-K-Y
1047926399 [18021] <pam/#webco> the root types listed on the applet are all wrong
1047926417 [18027] <pam/#webco> no, just found it but wanted to give you heads up
1047926781 [18032] <pam/#webco> ok, bug #5152
1047927421 [18094] <pam/#webco> thank you craig
1047927956 [18133] <pam/#webco> cbl: did you ever hear back from lcc regarding their file drop?  i don't remember seeing anything but maybe i missed it?
1047929434 [18147] <pam/#webco> accd is down
1047929676 [18156] <pam/#webco> thanks craig
1047929692 [18158] <pam/#webco> is there something that keeps causing this to happen, it seems to happen about once a week for them
1047930737 [18172] <pam/#webco> is anyone assigned to the bug?
1047930829 [18180] <pam/#webco> cbl: I am confused by your lcc comment, no bug, we did their patron drop file once I think, asked them to review data and accept so we could set up nightly drop, just wanted to know if we were running every night yet or still waiting
1047930948 [18187] <pam/#webco> can you check to be sure or are you sure?
1047931007 [18193] <pam/#webco> yep

1047932861 [18385] <pam/#webco> not yet but I see ellen sent in their patron load, the bug is actually on resource import structure though
1047932884 [18390] <pam/#webco> there are a couple of issues with ellen's spreadsheet so i will respond to her
1047933638 [18408] <pam/#webco> josh: shouldn't we send an email to users about the fact that they can't call in to us?
1047933663 [18410] <pam/#webco> I guess i don't mind if folks use my cell phone number
1047933900 [18423] <pam/#webco> craig: did at&t give any indication about how long it would take for them to look in to this?
1047934046 [18428] <pam/#webco> probably and I've got lots of muscle plus I'm pissed that they assured me that they could switch over without any disruption in service
1047934064 [18432] <pam/#webco> craig: can I get ticket number from you for at&t?
1047934102 [18448] <pam/#webco> is craig around?
1047934625 [18488] <pam/#webco> ok, at&t trouble ticket upgraded to 30min turn around from 24hr turn around
1047934658 [18496] <pam/#webco> i'm a very convincing consumer
1047934691 [18502] <pam/#webco> lots of "oh, I don't think sos" 
1047934727 [18512] <pam/#webco> good thing i'm not a webcheckout user, i'd me josh's and my own worst nightmare
1047934761 [18522] <pam/#webco> weeeell that's debatable!
1047934771 [18524] <pam/#webco> you should ask gordon about that

1048013141 [19938] <pam/#webco> cbl: do you know anything about umich patron load?

1048014566 [19956] <pam/#webco> cool, thanks
1048014608 [19964] <pam/#webco> well it seems that some folks are missing including jeff pearson, one of our main contacts, they are not being deleted but being marked as inactive, or is that the same thing
1048015102 [19970] <pam/#webco> ok, so they need to address their file, do you want to respond to the support email?

1048015234 [19986] <pam/#webco> why would he have to of been inactive in the earlier file, oh, so he is in the file?

1048020186 [20220] <pam/#webco> is rrt ready for testing yet?
1048020759 [20285] <pam/#webco> craig: I agree with Lee, or leave accom. people on patron tab for saic and add a field for set up people which is what most folks use accompy. for
1048020805 [20299] <pam/#webco> oh, when they are ready for 3.0?
1048020816 [20303] <pam/#webco> that would make more sense, less work now
1048020931 [20339] <pam/#webco> josh: i have never dealt with any client that uses those fields the way that saic does, everyone I have talked to used them to assign their own staff
1048020990 [20349] <pam/#webco> good impression
1048022540 [20477] <pam/#webco> gracchus: what's the url again?

1048025890 [20701] <pam/#webco> i think i need beta updated b/f i can test max's issues
1048025909 [20707] <pam/#webco> thanks
1048026997 [20761] <pam/#webco> gracchus: testing, if i add more than one of the same resource, one of them turns light purple, is there a reason for that?
1048027067 [20765] <pam/#webco> yeah, it's only happening on 35mm camera so far
1048029590 [20792] <pam/#webco> oh my god our phone work both in and out will wonders never cease
1048029632 [20798] <pam/#webco> i want a muzzle for rick torres, for my bday
1048029738 [20806] <pam/#webco> no
1048097831 [21125] <pam/#webco> hola
1048097866 [21133] <pam/#webco> i woke up this morning with my ears pluged up and I can hardly hear, very strange
1048104376 [21714] <pam/#webco> josh: I just forwarded Ithaca patron import to support
1048104470 [21732] <pam/#webco> cool
1048107373 [22078] <pam/#webco> vacuum warning: i know you folks on the second floor don't like it when mina vacuums but I have looked and can't find a replacement for the very broken push broom so I told mina she can vacuum once a week, please deal find a way to deal 
1048107391 [22083] <pam/#webco> yes
1048107399 [22087] <pam/#webco> you just want to run home
1048107435 [22105] <pam/#webco> maybe you could tie yourself to the vacuum in protest
1048108335 [22130] <pam/#webco> i need some clarification on some policy settings, i think i am staring at them too long so now I'm confused
1048108357 [22137] <pam/#webco> what is the differnce btwn ckt hours per week and max reser/chk hours
1048108376 [22141] <pam/#webco> here is what our docs say:
1048108376 [22143] <pam/#webco> Reserved hours per week specifies the maximum number of hours per week that a resource may be reserved by a patron.
1048108377 [22145] <pam/#webco> Max. Checkout/Reserve maximum amount of time that a patron may check out or reserve a resource.
1048108493 [22163] <pam/#webco> so the reserved p/week is for all patrons
1048108508 [22165] <pam/#webco> that's what i thought but the longer i looked at it the less sure i became, thanks
1048108755 [22176] <pam/#webco> oh, so you're not really limiting the hours a resource can be used overall, you are only limiting the number of hours an individual patron can use it for the week?
1048108774 [22180] <pam/#webco> carried over multiple allocations?
1048108789 [22184] <pam/#webco> ahhhh, nice
1048114005 [22442] <pam/#webco> is there a record for the number of computer crashes in one day?
1048114019 [22448] <pam/#webco> i win
1048114633 [22486] <pam/#webco> josh: i gotta cut out soon cause I have an appoint with our accountant (jealous?) but i will do some testing on max's current reports later tonight to confirm they have gone away with the latest update
1048114718 [22494] <pam/#webco> k
1048183782 [23291] <pam/#webco> hi

1048188267 [23483] <pam/#webco> ok, she said sorry she should have been more patient
1048190530 [23544] <pam/#webco> josh: i was not able to reproduce any of max's pin problems last night but I did find several other bugs in 3.0 that i am in the process of filing
1048190552 [23551] <pam/#webco> yeah
1048191052 [23568] <pam/#webco> josh: pls ignore that uri email that just came in to support,  i need to discuss with eric and then will get back to the guy
1048191168 [23576] <pam/#webco> josh: did you get any time to look into that one report max sent in about a reservation being picked up after being cancelled by adminstrator?

1048199553 [24047] <pam/#webco> ayres: before upgrading to 3.0 we may need to address that bug I just filed where you get an error in the left frame when returning an overdue allocation, nothing less convincing than an ugly error in the middle of a demo
1048199976 [24074] <pam/#webco> i have some time to do some rrt testing now, should i go to jesses instance or is there a merged 3.1 instance for me to test on?

1048278519 [25825] <pam/#webco> yes please
1048532026 [488] <pam/#webco> josh: they already have it and use it so it wasn't really giving them anything new, it just *sounds* like I am so very helpful ;)
1048532109 [500] <pam/#webco> josh: so we need a game plan for the several back logged evergreen issues now, are you going to look into their 'i swear i returned these' thing?

1049749124 [2571] <pam/#webco> ...Often, these staffers generally are not themselves entered as WebCheckout patrons...
1049749158 [2577] <pam/#webco> hmm, then the spec contridicts itself
1049749204 [2589] <pam/#webco> yeah i know but it also states that these fields have no logic nor integration with other parts of the application
1049756556 [2811] <pam/#webco> has any one else had Internet issues today?  I keep getting failed attempt errors when trying to reach different sites
1049756596 [2817] <pam/#webco> is it fucking covad issue you think?
1049757022 [2843] <pam/#webco> 66.146.194.10
1049759111 [2866] <pam/#webco> this is sooooo frustrating, is this stupid dns thing going to go away eventually?
1049823044 [3378] <pam/#webco> josh: what is the dealio with the chapman patron import.  We have the file so we can load it and make sure it's in the correct format.  They did purchase file drop which we will have to set up but can we load what they sent first?
1049823430 [3401] <pam/#onshored> hey kristine!
1049823479 [3403] <pam/#webco> we had to send their resource file back, not the patron one I think
1049824122 [3413] <pam/#webco> josh: looking over the patron file it looks like it is in pretty good shape
1049824160 [3417] <pam/#webco> thanks man
1049824161 [3421] <pam/#webco> dude
1049825562 [3492] <pam/#onshored> nice surprise!
1049826119 [3562] <pam/#webco> thanks josh
1049826128 [3564] <pam/#webco> did beta get an update last night?
1049827026 [3580] <pam/#webco> josh: does that email from max with steps taken by operator need testing or is it something you are already working on?
1049827041 [3582] <pam/#webco> problems in the IITS Cinema CC
1049827045 [3584] <pam/#webco> is the email
1049827352 [3603] <pam/#webco> josh: Patrick Cunningham is the tech contact there, not sure what his cred are but they did send their server here for install so that is probably not a good sign
1049827360 [3605] <pam/#webco> i mean chapman
1049827439 [3630] <pam/#webco> cbl: patrick just sent an info for an ftp account for patron filedrop for chapman, can you look this over, he of course, sent the password in the email
1049828103 [3657] <pam/#webco> crack, definitely crack
1049834262 [3959] <pam/#webco> i am still having dns problems with internet, is this going to go away on its own or do I have to do some vodoo
1049834351 [3969] <pam/#webco> thanks josh
1049834824 [3974] <pam/#webco> coffee, k00phi
1049835612 [4001] <pam/#webco> josh: no root resources on strigs resv page
1049835676 [4004] <pam/#webco> i don't see any resources on strings
1049836889 [4022] <pam/#webco> import can handle two different orgs being created, right?
1049836901 [4026] <pam/#webco> sweeyt
1049838390 [4038] <pam/#webco> josh: what is the skinny on the evergreen email issues? davec sent in another weird thing today
1049838425 [4041] <pam/#webco> cbl: do we need any other info from Chapman other than the ftp account stuff patrick sent to get their drop file running?
1049838464 [4047] <pam/#webco> cbl: also, can you check on the accd file drop, is that running normal or did we open it up to include all past deleted folks because of problems they had?
1049838481 [4051] <pam/#webco> yeah, I think josh is working that out, the subnet stuff, right?
1049838522 [4059] <pam/#webco> woohoo, all the answers i wanted :)
1049842068 [4142] <pam/#webco> yikes
1049909345 [5087] <pam/#webco> josh: what do you think about upgrading chapman before I do their training next tues/wed
1049909537 [5094] <pam/#webco> ok, cool, when can you fit that in do you think?
1049910431 [5152] <pam/#webco> i logged on to usc zem. center and it is really slow, josh, would you like me to send an email to support?
1049910509 [5159] <pam/#webco> ok

1049910876 [5189] <pam/#webco> what is the difference btwn Printer queue and printer host on 3.0?
1049911173 [5220] <pam/#webco> craig: UI on contact looks good, covres more, me likey
1049911262 [5236] <pam/#webco> craig: which will take precidence, meaning if I find a match in the database and then I decide I want a different phone number there, will typing in a new one replace the one on the patron file?
1049915194 [5458] <pam/#webco> josh: on phone with Chris at Gordon, I can't get in to their instance, subnet issue?
1049915516 [5468] <pam/#webco> chris sending email describing problem he is having with setting schedule and the schedulator, I told him we would respond with what we needed to be able to get into his system and go from there
1049915637 [5478] <pam/#webco> josh: max just sent in email, i will check it out
1049915693 [5488] <pam/#webco> josh: can i get concordia's IP?  i only seem to have our staged instance stuff for them
1049915711 [5492] <pam/#webco> thx
1049915989 [5514] <pam/#webco> josh: can't get in, getting server not found error from browser
1049916031 [5521] <pam/#webco> yep
1049916035 [5523] <pam/#webco> can you get it?
1049916061 [5543] <pam/#webco> oh, ok
1049916075 [5545] <pam/#webco> damn canadians
1049916359 [5568] <pam/#webco> josh: can't find any record of ck max sent in, no cks at all for the patron he mentioned, do you want to check the logs?
1049916386 [5570] <pam/#webco> may be an order that was never fully committed
1049916408 [5572] <pam/#webco> i can just email max and ask for more info
1049916752 [5579] <pam/#webco> cbl: is lansing cc file drop running and all good?
1049917310 [5582] <pam/#webco> what version are we on in 3.0 line?  should i be milestoning to 3.0.1 or 3.0.2?
1049917391 [5595] <pam/#webco> error on ucb test instance of in current weekly schedule, well, they are running 3.0.1 so i guess 3.0.2 would make more sense, duh
1049917431 [5601] <pam/#webco> k
1049917713 [5610] <pam/#webco> yeah, needs a lot more testing in my op
1049917773 [5614] <pam/#webco> actually i could use the most recent update.  i could do some testing today if I can get that soon, even though I know adam doesn't like it but I am the only one testing
1049918014 [5621] <pam/#webco> do you think you could update it or bug one of your friends down there to?
1049920024 [5821] <pam/#webco> testing priting on 3.0.1, just to clarify, if I have an IP I am supposed to put it in the printer host and it should work, right?  Cause I did that and it said no printer configured, if I put the IP in the Printer queue line, then it printed, that's a bug?
1049920062 [5838] <pam/#webco> upstairs 66.167.155.238
1049920117 [5860] <pam/#webco> ucb.webcheckout.net
1049921040 [5968] <pam/#webco> ayres: cbl called me and explained printing thing
1049921595 [6007] <pam/#webco> ayres: having momentary loss of brain funtion, what is an 'incomplete recharge' invoice?
1049921639 [6016] <pam/#webco> oh, so it is missing account codes or dept codes?
1049921833 [6047] <pam/#webco> poop, ok
1049921893 [6051] <pam/#webco> ayres: so an invoice that is 'incomplete recharge' will come up when you search for 'recharge' too, so it is really just a way to pull invoices that may be missing some info they want, cool
1049922038 [6061] <pam/#webco> please let me know when ucb is back up
1049922040 [6064] <pam/#webco> thanks

1050005874 [245] <pam/#webco> josh: so to test ucs contact note issue, just make fake reservation and then take a look tomorrow and see if note is gone?
1050005911 [248] <pam/#webco> nesta: kelly from ucla just emailed to support to stop development on Full Day delivery, they aren't going to do them any more
1050007453 [295] <pam/#webco> josh: I will call patrick with admin password
1050007465 [311] <pam/#webco> yes
1050007474 [319] <pam/#webco> opus is driving me nuts

1050010716 [505] <pam/#webco> josh: looking at chapman instance, find resource types form and something funky happened, can you take a look?
1050010866 [516] <pam/#webco> the camera-film rtypes went nuts
1050010871 [520] <pam/#webco> yep

1050080925 [1287] <pam/#webco> there is a bug in chapman resource import
1050080933 [1289] <pam/#webco> unless josh fixed that this morning
1050081026 [1316] <pam/#webco> bug #5305
1050082401 [1363] <pam/#webco> nesta: you around?

1050095658 [1792] <pam/#webco> am i stupid
1050095706 [1802] <pam/#webco> what am i looking for
1050095844 [1824] <pam/#webco> ok, he is sending another file anyway, i can get him to fix it
1050095874 [1828] <pam/#webco> i didn't know before but now i guess they are adding a lot of media as resources
1050096074 [1847] <pam/#webco> ok
1050334109 [2117] <pam/#webco> ok
1050334118 [2121] <pam/#webco> we should talk, i will come down in a min
1050337974 [2184] <pam/#webco> josh: umil resource list came into support finally, they are not using yet, we need to decide if they should get 3.0 and import or just import, they still have to get us their patrons
1050338825 [2204] <pam/#webco> johs:ok, can you let me know when you will be able to fit that in and I will contact jon and let him know
1050339245 [2211] <pam/#webco> thanks
1050340675 [2230] <pam/#webco> josh: usc guy smokin pipe.  I set up two test reservations per his instructions and both still have the contact note I put in for them
1050341951 [2269] <pam/#webco> josh: i think I didn't follow rich's instructions correctly :(  I made reservations but didn't actually check out equipemtn and return it cause I didn't want to mess with their availablity so the reservations cancelled because they were not picked up. Do you think this makes a difference?  I can redo it
1050342358 [2292] <pam/#webco> that's what I said in meeting today
1050342363 [2294] <pam/#webco> yes
1050342394 [2308] <pam/#webco> can you check their import stuff, it really shouldn't over write that field
1050342412 [2317] <pam/#webco> i would think, but maybe i is wrong
1050342418 [2321] <pam/#webco> oh, ok
1050342440 [2328] <pam/#webco> yeah
1050342463 [2335] <pam/#webco> do you want to respond to rich or would you like me to?
1050342476 [2339] <pam/#webco> np
1050342579 [2348] <pam/#webco> josh: baylor job number is 16111
1050349286 [2632] <pam/#webco> josh: do you know what problem max is asking us to look at in that screen shot he sent?
1050349820 [2777] <pam/#webco> josh: hmm, well the not available is probably coming up because the reservation isn't for 8 more days i bet, ill log into their instance and see
1050352644 [3174] <pam/#webco> nesta: just entered new ucla bug, bug #5312

1050941041 [808] <pam/#webco> hi all
1050947559 [925] <pam/#webco> josh: the file from ellen is the corrected file with updated pclass and removal of duplicate IDs so is needs to loaded
1050955167 [1155] <pam/#webco> josh: for the acces. field on the resource import, do items have to be seperated by | or does it work to have / also?
1050955287 [1176] <pam/#webco> josh: every time I get a sample file customers use / instead of |, even though I go over it with them and documentation is very clear, no worries, I will correct them again :)
1050955418 [1197] <pam/#webco> josh: i can file a bug on it but I wouldn't worry about it
1050955439 [1203] <pam/#webco> vertical bar, very high-tech
1050959729 [1470] <pam/#webco> can i get a beta updatey?
1050959760 [1476] <pam/#webco> yipeeeeeeee
1050959768 [1478] <pam/#webco> coffeeeeeeeeee
1050959876 [1488] <pam/#webco> what about an update for ucla.webcheckout.net so they stop reporting old buggies to me?
1050959899 [1492] <pam/#webco> oh wait, they have put in a bunch of their own data, don't do that, they will be sad
1050959935 [1499] <pam/#webco> nothing but they wanted to test with their own data so they have been entering in some stuff
1050959943 [1503] <pam/#webco> they know it will go away never to be seen again
1050959946 [1506] <pam/#webco> eventually
1050959979 [1511] <pam/#webco> where are the baristas?
1050960078 [1517] <pam/#webco> i make bad coffee, i will ask dan

1051031359 [2662] <pam/#webco> hiya
1051032807 [2768] <pam/#webco> if I find a bug in 3.0.1 does it get milestoned to 3.1 or is there going to be a 3.0.2?
1051210720 [390] <pam/#webco> adam: chris jones
1051210830 [402] <pam/#webco> uiuc is up and on 3.0.1 i think
1051210841 [406] <pam/#webco> i don't know about ku and I think everyone else is at lunch
1051211851 [460] <pam/#webco> i can't get to beta :(
1051211888 [464] <pam/#webco> well that would explain it
1051211907 [468] <pam/#webco> really?
1051211951 [478] <pam/#webco> np, just let me know when it is back pls
1051218633 [630] <pam/#webco> what is the url that will get me to bugzilla now?
1051218642 [632] <pam/#webco> i didn't save it from yesterday
1051222264 [1158] <pam/#webco> there doesn't seem to be a milestone drop down on bugs anymore
1051222323 [1171] <pam/#webco> ok
1051222393 [1177] <pam/#webco> cool, thx
1051222963 [1267] <pam/#webco> adam: in response to some earlier comments you made on irc, ucb has been looking at their 3.0.1 instance and have even sent in lists of comments/bugs; just because they didn't catch what went wrong this morning with UIUC doesn't mean they haven't been doing anything
1051290497 [1726] <pam/#webco> mmm, what kind?
1051290505 [1728] <pam/#webco> is mail down?
1051290516 [1736] <pam/#webco> yummmmmmmmmm
1051295123 [2198] <pam/#webco> usc just report the container node not found error on 2.0.11
1051295137 [2202] <pam/#webco> cbl: can you take that if I file it since josh is out ?
1051295207 [2208] <pam/#webco> ok, filed 5353
1051295244 [2215] <pam/#webco> I think the only association between patron and org is if they are employed 
1051295262 [2218] <pam/#webco> but I guess they can be employed by more than one org too
1051295280 [2226] <pam/#webco> i don't know, maybe just take away that field altogether then if it don't make no sense
1051295289 [2231] <pam/#webco> agreed
1051295370 [2237] <pam/#webco> cbl: is that patch something you can do today for usc or should I respond to them and say it will get fixed after hours?
1051295476 [2246] <pam/#webco> ok
1051296351 [2277] <pam/#webco> cbl: Micheal Trainer is from Zem. Equipment Center and he reported, I think they only have a live instance
1051296524 [2296] <pam/#webco> cbl: it is actually on the Hours tab in the Admin page at the Zem. Equipment center
1051296632 [2308] <pam/#webco> cbl: thanks can you either repond to m. trainer when it is done or let me know and I will let him know it is fixed
1051300736 [2344] <pam/#webco> sure
1051300739 [2346] <pam/#webco> bug #5288
1051300795 [2351] <pam/#webco> ok
1051301595 [2357] <pam/#webco> they have been busy for a couple of weeks but they were looking and sent a list of comments that I have been going back and forth with them on but I don't think it has gotten a lot of attention over the last couple of weeks
1051302269 [2382] <pam/#webco> on beta, the weekly schedule has disappeared and I think it was updated last night, is that a migration bug?
1051302462 [2396] <pam/#webco> ok, so if it normally rebuilds with a schedule and didn't this time, what would that be?
1051302481 [2398] <pam/#webco> just a bug
1051304874 [2415] <pam/#webco> gracchus: on 3.1 there is a new item added to the Find People with Holds report.  It is a statement on the search parameter side that says "Converd to hold?" with a check box, Do you know what is this suppose to mean/do?
1051305090 [2436] <pam/#webco> used to be covered by Status of Invoice being set to Hold so maybe when that bug is worked out it should go back to that
1051305109 [2440] <pam/#webco> "that bug" being the one on missing invoice status
1051305165 [2449] <pam/#webco> it should returns the invoice with a hold
1051305201 [2455] <pam/#webco> oh, ok, well that reports interface may need some work then cause it just runs in the Find Invoice function
1051305693 [2459] <pam/#webco> there seems to be several ugly new bugs on 3.1 today, after yesterday's update
1051305708 [2461] <pam/#webco> can't even confirm an allocation anymore :(
1051546556 [3235] <pam/#webco> howdy
1051546572 [3241] <pam/#webco> we are rescheduling meeting for tomorrow since craig, lee and adam are all away
1051547269 [3335] <pam/#webco> lee_pad: on pliskin, there seems to be an invoice type "normal" should this be non recharge?
1051547630 [3339] <pam/#webco> hmm, seems like i found a different bug

1051731947 [6507] <pam/#webco> ucla has been entering some of their data into their test instance, can we give them an update to the latest 3.1 code without losing all of that so they can continue testing?
1051732037 [6534] <pam/#webco> ok
1051732102 [6538] <pam/#webco> an idea why i would get this error trying to reach ucla production instance
1051732103 [6540] <pam/#webco> mod_webapp(warp) error
1051732103 [6542] <pam/#webco> Unable to connect (-2) to Host: 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) Port: 8007 
1051732146 [6550] <pam/#webco> i've tried that, it doesn't come p
1051732147 [6552] <pam/#webco> up
1051732195 [6562] <pam/#webco> craig: is that something they need to fix or us?
1051732240 [6584] <pam/#webco> josh: i don't know, i was trying to reach their instance, not on phone with them or anything
1051732289 [6599] <pam/#webco> josh: can you take a look, I do have to call them 
1051732302 [6603] <pam/#webco> cool
1051733425 [6674] <pam/#webco> cbl: we need to address the error that ACCD when they tried to run their inventory report or we will be forced to do that report for them again, did you file a bug for it?
1051733503 [6678] <pam/#webco> josh: on 3.0.1? update?
1051733521 [6686] <pam/#webco> k
1051736693 [7009] <pam/#webco> josh: is it possible to load ucla data from their 3.0.1 instance to their 3.1 testing data so they don't have to reenter stuff to continue testing?
1051736736 [7013] <pam/#webco> ayres: same question :)
1051736845 [7025] <pam/#webco> i am going to call kelly now so I will let you know shortly
1051737103 [7049] <pam/#webco> ayres: tomorrow would be great if you can give it a go
1051737111 [7056] <pam/#webco> thanks
1051738277 [7071] <pam/#webco> what does anybody think about dave c's request to have evergreen data put in 3.1 so they can test rrt?  they are currently still on 2.0.12 i think, i can tell him it is not feasible currently if it's too much of a pain
1051738611 [7101] <pam/#webco> josh: sara at saic just called, they are down
1051738645 [7105] <pam/#webco> ayres: ok, that would be great, can i give him a rough estimate of when?
1051742673 [7247] <pam/#webco> oy, peapod now charges $25 to deliver an order, yow
1051742698 [7251] <pam/#webco> no more peapod for us
1051890386 [10605] <pam/#webco> morning
1051890596 [10621] <pam/#webco> ayres: ok, just let me know when i can call ucla 
1051890616 [10628] <pam/#webco> josh: i have another training session in about 10 min so i won't be much help until after 3pm today
1051894488 [10867] <pam/#webco> grrrr i hate training on new releases, bugs, bugs
1051897549 [10937] <pam/#webco> what does the "hold days" on general tab of org level mean?
1051897727 [10943] <pam/#webco> that's what I thought
1051897792 [10946] <pam/#webco> what is "Allow multiple IP per session?"
1051908817 [11877] <pam/#webco> ayres: what's the update on the ucla testing instance?
1051908945 [11889] <pam/#webco> no problem, i was in a training session so I wasn't on irc
1051911598 [11929] <pam/#webco> josh: don't do anything with that chapman file yet.  i am sending patrick an email to let him know we need to nail this down a final file so we should wait for confirmation from him
1051911738 [11935] <pam/#webco> i figured but thought i would warn just in case :)
1051912270 [11947] <pam/#webco> was there any movement on getting evergreen a testing instance of 3.1?
1051913109 [11970] <pam/#webco> yeah but they need to test rrt so its just for that not for using
1051913140 [11972] <pam/#webco> they really just want their data in a test instance, they didn't ask for 3.0.2 yet
1051913153 [11976] <pam/#webco> confused
1051913207 [11992] <pam/#webco> well if you want to put them on the list to get it that is fine but I really need a sign off on rrt from them cause we have cashola waiting on it
1051913222 [11998] <pam/#webco> thanks
1051913244 [12006] <pam/#webco> cool, i'll email davec and let him know we can get him a site next week to look at
1051913247 [12009] <pam/#webco> meeee toooooo
1051913256 [12013] <pam/#webco> i missed that party!
1051913390 [12027] <pam/#webco> and you sit at your desk coding with a one legged parrot on your shoulder
1051913406 [12035] <pam/#webco> ah yes, it is all coming back
1051913425 [12037] <pam/#webco> i like it when we make cbl walk the plank for kicks

1052150677 [12989] <pam/#webco> meeting time
1052158653 [13175] <pam/#webco> when is the last time beta got an update?
1052158663 [13177] <pam/#webco> maybe time for one for testing?
1052164304 [13353] <pam/#webco> does the beta data set normally have media data in it or am i imagining it used to?
1052164472 [13384] <pam/#webco> weird, i don't get any results on the media page
1052164555 [13396] <pam/#webco> strange, i get results from find resources if i look for type media but i don't get any results searching from media page
1052164564 [13398] <pam/#webco> locations seem fine
1052168915 [13518] <pam/#webco> cbl: are you looking into the gordon issue?  it looks like that resource is on an allocation which is why it is status reserved
1052169106 [13525] <pam/#webco> it's on ck4090 but it does look like the resource then becomes unavailable indefinitely after that allocation's return time
1052171589 [13544] <pam/#webco> cbl: sorry wasn't paying attention to irc, did you get it or do you need my help with something?
1052240522 [14547] <pam/#webco> did anyone ever get anywhere with an evergreen 3.1 instance?
1052240552 [14551] <pam/#webco> josh: did you see patrick from chapman sent what he says is the last file of resource data?
1052254881 [14988] <pam/#webco> johs: fyi, i am out next wed 1/2 day and thur and fri training lcc

1052329001 [1067] <pam/#webco> my stupid computer keeps crashing
1052331741 [1133] <pam/#webco> josh: lcc is sending resource file again, making a few small changed i noticed 
1052331751 [1137] <pam/#webco> so disregard first email with file in it
1052331785 [1140] <pam/#webco> we will need to run that as soon as possible cause I want to make sure we get the revision process going cause I gots to train their butts next week
1052331806 [1146] <pam/#webco> when the new file comes in, in a few min
1052331812 [1148] <pam/#webco> would be great
1052332917 [1172] <pam/#webco> josh: lcc new file just came in so when ever you get a chance
1052332953 [1176] <pam/#webco> you rock, they need an upgrade to 3.0.2 also
1052334040 [1247] <pam/#webco> josh: i was looking at the file with the guy and made reference to the last item at 682 so I would go with yes
1052334069 [1260] <pam/#webco> me neither
1052336987 [1498] <pam/#webco> altogether or they have root but no type
1052337143 [1504] <pam/#webco> hmm, so if they don't need more levels they should populate the resource type and not the root?
1052337648 [1510] <pam/#webco> k, i'll get with paul again
1052338020 [1522] <pam/#webco> kreig: did you say in the meeting on monday you were going to be on 3.1 bugs? there hasn't been much movement on it over the last couple of weeks
1052338948 [1629] <pam/#webco> kreig: can you see my question about please
1052338956 [1631] <pam/#webco> above i mean

1052339087 [1650] <pam/#webco> kreig: no, i was in the meeting but i just wondered when 3.1 bugs were going to get some attention
1052339289 [1669] <pam/#webco> uh oh, icky problem at uiuc
1052342448 [1874] <pam/#webco> cbl: i can stop testing if you want to take alpha down
1052345515 [2039] <pam/#webco> cbl: ok, i filed lots of bugs today so i think i am done anyway
1052346268 [2054] <pam/#webco> lata
1052501494 [202] <pam/#webco> josh: after a long wait my irc finally connected
1052501507 [210] <pam/#webco> yeah, i just left it alone, computer magic
1052501794 [215] <pam/#webco> ucla.webcheckout.net is getting WCO errors all over the place that are not coming up in beta
1052502051 [223] <pam/#webco> well, they were updated with their own data last week at the same time beta so I don't know what the deal is, maybe it's cause of the migration?
1052502117 [226] <pam/#webco> can we get their instance updated then?  they are one of the only customers who actually is testing
1052502318 [263] <pam/#webco> do we keep logs of when the last time ucla instance was updated?  I don't want to tell them we are going to update and then have them get the same errors
1052503211 [275] <pam/#webco> sorry, didn't know both craigs were out, i thought we weren't going to do that
1052504183 [338] <pam/#webco> rimpoche: that's coolio, i'll just keep piling crap on josh til he cries :) love the pain
1052507864 [418] <pam/#webco> josh: new lcc import came in, now i feel bad asking you for anything
1052509502 [518] <pam/#webco> josh: i know you are working on test migration for saic but i really need to try to get lcc resources in before i go out there on wed. and i am sure there are more problems with the file so can you run that, please, pretty please, with support sugar on top?
1052509523 [523] <pam/#webco> thank you
1052509538 [527] <pam/#webco> ok, ill just bug you every 10 min or so then
1052511510 [683] <pam/#webco> josh: do you need me to communicate something to lcc?
1052513152 [754] <pam/#webco> josh: i assume you did see that chapman doesn't have their container info like uiuc
1052513259 [765] <pam/#webco> only an hour and 20min to go josh
1052513330 [772] <pam/#webco> silly boy
1052513366 [782] <pam/#webco> sorry i'm not much help but let me know if there is anything you can pass on to me

1052514041 [857] <pam/#webco> don't ignore my call josh ;)
1052514059 [859] <pam/#webco> any way we can run that for him, maybe lee if he's feeling generous?

1052762705 [2940] <pam/#webco> cbl: lcc has sent in a cleaned up version of the resource import, josh was working on that, do we need to wait for him to come back tomorrow or can you do it?
1052763351 [2974] <pam/#webco> cbl: i think josh was going to clear out their instance and reload everything, we can wait for him to return tomorrow, no biggie i think
1052765360 [3020] <pam/#webco> does any one have some time to deal with UCLA problems, bug #5387

1053375285 [3630] <pam/#webco> st joe, evergreen, what's the difference really?  yeah, sorry
1053375331 [3638] <pam/#webco> good plan
1053384383 [4335] <pam/#webco> goin home
1053540739 [587] <pam/#webco> cbl: you around?
1053540765 [589] <pam/#webco> what do you mean in msg to lcc that most of the resource file was rejected due to "missing names"?
1053540807 [591] <pam/#webco> also, the file only has 677 pieces of equipment, what's with the 1300 rejected records?
1053540988 [595] <pam/#webco> clients are stupid
1053541145 [599] <pam/#webco> so is any one at work?
1053541177 [609] <pam/#webco> great, i'd like to be the guy who mops the greasy floors
1053541210 [623] <pam/#webco> so we keep going around and around about the "empty rows"  
1053541226 [629] <pam/#webco> the client can't tell if the rows are "empty"
1053541233 [631] <pam/#webco> cause they look "empty"!!
1053541249 [633] <pam/#webco> can't we remove them from the file?
1053541296 [643] <pam/#webco> ok, well any way, don't run it again cause I don't think the dope got it right again, i have told him about a billion time that rtype is REQUIRED and of course there are some empty rtype fields
1053541330 [652] <pam/#webco> it's only 677 records, how hard is that to get right for fuck sakes???
1053541370 [662] <pam/#webco> and every time a resource is missing a rtype they get put in the i'm fucking stupid default type
1053541383 [666] <pam/#webco> sweet
1053541448 [670] <pam/#webco> josh: i don't know if it is because the import was unsuccessful or what but the admin log in for lansing does not work today
1053542269 [725] <pam/#webco> josh: yes 
1053542444 [742] <pam/#webco> josh: sure
1053545746 [803] <pam/#webco> cbl: do you know what the status of the lcc filedrop is?  It did not seem to be running when I was training last week, i checked the logs and so none for filedrop
1053547658 [865] <pam/#webco> johs: i am about to go and file some 3.0.2 bugs i found in training last week
1053548389 [904] <pam/#webco> cbl: can you send me an update email on lcc filedrop to forward to them to let them know what exactly we are still waiting on, or you can send it directly, which ever?
1053552063 [1271] <pam/#webco> krieg: some guy from onshore si on the phone asking about our mail server, can i transfer to you?
1053552086 [1273] <pam/#webco> some one hit craig for me
1053552152 [1277] <pam/#webco> what ext again?
1053552193 [1281] <pam/#webco> he's calling you, i couldn't get transfer to work, weird
1053552224 [1285] <pam/#webco> we'd all be screwed
1053555051 [1506] <pam/#webco> cbl: did you get a chance to email lcc?  
1053555104 [1516] <pam/#webco> cbl: ok, you said earlier or maybe mark did that there was some back and forth between you and paul about the resource file, do you know what the status is on that? is he revising again?
1053555166 [1521] <pam/#webco> so you didn't talk to paul after your email yesterday?
1053555219 [1527] <pam/#webco> ok, tks
1053555567 [1550] <pam/#webco> adam: just in the mode of filing several 3.0.4 bugs, remilestone til your hearts content
1053555592 [1554] <pam/#webco> ok
1053555598 [1557] <pam/#webco> i'll try to control myself
1053555664 [1570] <pam/#webco> i think its on hold till we can get enough client interrest and cash baby
1053555762 [1594] <pam/#webco> josh: since i am out in new york for wed, thur, friday it may be best if you get a floating day but we should run that by eric
1053555799 [1596] <pam/#webco> so maybe a different week you get a three day week since monday is your normal day off
1053555933 [1608] <pam/#webco> cbl: i will be out tomorrow so I just want to make sure some one contact lcc when/if we get a fix ready or they send a file for another import, just tell me you're on it and I will stop asking you a zillion questions about it
1053555940 [1612] <pam/#webco> adam: i agree with the logic, just not the timing
1053555967 [1620] <pam/#webco> since i am out training at ithaca it's bad to have both support peeps out on the same day
1053558208 [1698] <pam/#webco> lame?
1053558847 [1700] <pam/#webco> im outtie
1053558855 [1702] <pam/#webco> see ya all on friday
1053710297 [4868] <pam/#webco> howdy
1053710332 [4878] <pam/#webco> did dan asks some one down there to hook up our lovely young tenant with internet upstairs in the back?
1053710339 [4882] <pam/#webco> josh: ok

1053710402 [4905] <pam/#webco> she is staying in that back bedroom up here, poor thing
1053710420 [4913] <pam/#webco> dan told her we would set up one of the ports in the back to our dsl i think
1053710433 [4923] <pam/#webco> yeah, living, and she doesn't know any one in chicago either, i feel bad for her
1053710503 [4939] <pam/#webco> port 0316A
1053711148 [4941] <pam/#webco> josh: lcc instance keeps getting flipped back to central time, any way to keep this from happening?
1053711170 [4945] <pam/#webco> i'll file bug for it
1053717562 [4964] <pam/#webco> josh: you saw container bug?  i saw that in lcc training too but was having trouble reproducing it
1053717679 [4975] <pam/#webco> yes, I added an item as a contained resource and then tried to remove it and got error and it would not remove
1053723736 [5179] <pam/#webco> josh: new file coming from accd for new department, we don't have a PO yet so feel free to ignore for now :)

1054051502 [5948] <pam/#webco> josh:  can ithaca get an update to the latest release soes i can train them with a whole new set ofbugs
1054053243 [6153] <pam/#webco> josh: did you see my request for Ithaca?  do you want me to file a bug for it?
1054053309 [6165] <pam/#webco> josh: ok, no problem, training is not until thursday morning so it can wait for tomorrow but i am on a plane tomorrow so i won't be here to bug you about it
1054055857 [6343] <pam/#webco> josh: i will file and respond to laurie for sfsu container-node error, should i ask her if she wants to upgrade?
1054056066 [6378] <pam/#webco> sfsu is not in production so you can easily move their upgarde off until next week or when ever you feel you have more time
1054056088 [6380] <pam/#webco> but she will need the schedule fix
1054056101 [6384] <pam/#webco> ok, i'll ask her
1054056103 [6388] <pam/#webco> when
1054060599 [6802] <pam/#webco> oy, auto circulate problems at gordon
1054060810 [6824] <pam/#webco> josh: sure thing, do you know what date you upgraded gordon?
1054060836 [6838] <pam/#webco> no is the wrong answer, try again
1054060861 [6855] <pam/#webco> ok
1054064352 [7151] <pam/#webco> josh: would gordon issue be a 3.0.4 or support action?
1054064387 [7155] <pam/#webco> auto-circulate issue
1054064407 [7160] <pam/#webco> ok
1054068739 [7298] <pam/#webco> time to kiss dan, josh first
1054068771 [7303] <pam/#webco> yep
1054070472 [7341] <pam/#webco> ayres: i found allocation failing back to 3/5/03 for that resource type on Gordon, bug not prior to that date
1054070628 [7346] <pam/#webco> so it was happening prior to upgrade but they didn't notice or didn't report
1054070712 [7358] <pam/#webco> ok, still boogie that the auto-circulate box was checked and said it was coming from org policy when it really wasn't set there
1054072238 [7445] <pam/#webco> ayres: ok on bug to closey, they will let us know if something more goes wonky
1054074688 [7460] <pam/#webco> ok, i'm out, call me on cell if ya need me, otherwise, see you monday

1054664968 [401] <pam/#webco> also, i am going to do a round of 3.1 smashing, can i get the latest update to that too?
1054665366 [458] <pam/#webco> gracchus: are you saying beta won't be up or that if i do testing it will be on non-updated version?
1054665494 [475] <pam/#webco> ok, would you prefer i delay testing until it is updated
1054665576 [483] <pam/#webco> ok, i will test my little heart out, concordia is testing now too, yay
1054665585 [485] <pam/#webco> also, can i get a response on the demo update request
1054665595 [490] <pam/#webco> sorry ayres, but what is a girl suppose to do?

1054666233 [586] <pam/#webco> ha
1054666621 [608] <pam/#webco> yes, i think so, we don't want to load it on their production instance yet do we?
1054666659 [613] <pam/#webco> well only you can tell me if that may cause problems for them or if they won't notice
1054666674 [615] <pam/#webco> i'm really just guessing it might
1054666704 [622] <pam/#webco> even if we do a staged instance?
1054666732 [626] <pam/#webco> right
1054666746 [630] <pam/#webco> josh: do you have an opinion on what would be best?
1054666788 [642] <pam/#webco> ok, that's what i thought
1054666831 [656] <pam/#webco> ignatius: no, they will have to review it too, we will send them the url

1054929167 [8234] <pam/#webco> josh: thanks, you so funny
1054932510 [8331] <pam/#webco> josh: looks like some the rtypes are duplicating on ithaca import still, check out PPCES cc, under Portable Equipment, 3 or 4 of them are doubles
1054934385 [8388] <pam/#webco> josh: my computer crashed so i didn't see if you responded to my comment about ithaca
1054934417 [8394] <pam/#webco> so sad
1054934524 [8400] <pam/#webco> then what?
1054934535 [8402] <pam/#webco> is it a problem with file or import?
1054939966 [8550] <pam/#webco> i'm outtie to check out monica's art
1055174704 [8703] <pam/#webco> mornin
1055175214 [8711] <pam/#webco> does jesse, craig or cbl take tuesdays off?
1055175498 [8715] <pam/#webco> hey josh
1055175528 [8719] <pam/#webco> what is the deal with the Ithaca import, she really needs to get going and we can't seem to get them in correctly
1055175534 [8721] <pam/#webco> how are you feeling?
1055175542 [8725] <pam/#webco> cool
1055175581 [8735] <pam/#webco> glad to hear you are improving
1055175609 [8739] <pam/#webco> ok, ellen emailed me again first thing this morning so when you know something pls let me know so I can advise her
1055176058 [8762] <pam/#webco> josh: can I just forwarded an email from ellen to support with a couple of other items she noticed with the import, can you take a look pls, i will add to bug too
1055176093 [8770] <pam/#webco> josh: remove the "can" from previous stmt, no coffee yet
1055176370 [8796] <pam/#webco> josh: i know it is your day off but I would really like to try and get this ithaca thing taken care of, ellen is loosing her patience with us, can cbl do it since you are not technically here today or are you too far into it?
1055176505 [8808] <pam/#webco> josh: I don't understand what you mean by specify parent types for those wacko looping?  like the ones i put in the bug?
1055176595 [8812] <pam/#webco> 55474
1055176597 [8814] <pam/#webco> 5544
1055178617 [8840] <pam/#webco> josh: do you just want me to put them in the bug? if you look at the heir on the find rtypes page it looks like they all do it
1055178651 [8842] <pam/#webco> some just not as much as others, some seem to just duplicate, some seem to loop
1055178694 [8844] <pam/#webco> there is also the issue that ellen wrote in about contained resources appearing in the drill down list as if they could be scheduled
1055178695 [8846] <pam/#webco> oy
1055178839 [8858] <pam/#webco> kreig: did you see that email from adam about renewing our domain name?
1055179250 [8874] <pam/#webco> josh: i put ellen's notes in the bug, do you want me to open an second one for the container issues?
1055179996 [8940] <pam/#webco> josh: i bumped the priority on the ithaca bugs, made them p1 crit but they should actually be blockers even i think
1055188617 [9427] <pam/#onshored> ignatius: did you take over the ithaca import stuff since josh is really out today?
1055189984 [9572] <pam/#onshored> josh: do you want to hand over the ithaca thing to cbl?
1055194365 [9854] <pam/#webco> josh: ucb go to go with upgrade in the morning? 9am?
1055194379 [9856] <pam/#webco> richard on phone, wants to make sure we are ready to go and they don't need to do anytihng on their end
1055194495 [9868] <pam/#webco> ok, tomorrow am it is.  Richard said he will be in about 730am pacific so he will be there if you need anything 
1055195065 [9914] <pam/#webco> josh: that is what they want, i went over it with them already

1055260234 [10510] <pam/#webco> josh: so what is the status of ithaca import?  we need to convice ellen to change her rtypes?
1055260273 [10522] <pam/#webco> josh: what does soon mean
1055260308 [10526] <pam/#webco> is that what is causing the other rtypes to douple up too? even though they don't loop like the lab-classroom thingy
1055260328 [10528] <pam/#webco> what about the containers coming into the applet as researvable resources?
1055260428 [10537] <pam/#webco> well she can't use it even if she does change the classroom thing if all the other stuff is still wonky
1055260495 [10543] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks, i am sure she will call me or email with her unhappy self
1055261052 [10581] <pam/#webco> josh: i just found some wrong crap with the ithaca spreadsheet, i quit by the way
1055261094 [10595] <pam/#webco> josh: i could never leave you josh
1055261102 [10599] <pam/#webco> i am calling ellen, she has some fixin to do
1055261463 [10673] <pam/#webco> don't cry josh
1055261489 [10677] <pam/#webco> it will all be over soon when all the webcheckout users get together and lynch us
1055261518 [10683] <pam/#webco> furni?
1055261524 [10689] <pam/#webco> ahhhhh
1055261540 [10691] <pam/#webco> you'll be like anne frank living in their basement?
1055268198 [10824] <pam/#webco> josh: ithaca import is back in ellen's hands, phew
1055268227 [10826] <pam/#webco> she is going to make the changes needed for rtype structure and remove the classroom-ilab-classroom crap
1055268531 [10832] <pam/#webco> thanks
1055268615 [10834] <pam/#webco> josh: when you get back from lunch, reminder that accd is set for upgrade tomorrow morning, can we check to make sure that they have all the upgrades to their server b/f trying to run it.  They had to make some adjustments to let us take over during operation hours and postponing them would make them unhappy and therefore make me unhappy when they bitch at me :)
1055275743 [11119] <pam/#webco> any body know what the ip address is of the printer on 2nd floor?
1055276664 [11246] <pam/#webco> josh: i will tackle ukansasss email and ask you question if i need help, probably get to it tomorrow
1055277162 [11288] <pam/#webco> josh: i am sending email to davec at evergreen regarding upgrade to 3.0, does he need to do anyting on his end?
1055286885 [12029] <pam/#webco> outtie
1055351056 [12553] <pam/#webco> josh: what needs to be cleaned up?  i haven't gotten to your email yet, ill read that first...
1055351397 [12565] <pam/#webco> josh: why are the rtypes showing up several times in ithaca, is there an extra space or something causing that or is ther another bug?
1055351521 [12582] <pam/#webco> I would, i don't know if my phone works with the email thing
1055351611 [12598] <pam/#webco> josh: i don't think we can pass onto ithaca the removal of all that bad crap, they would end up deleting stuff they need, I am sure of it
1055351647 [12602] <pam/#webco> if need be I can convince ellen that we need to reinstall and just let her reset up users and policy that she has
1055351661 [12608] <pam/#webco> ahhh, a lot of this was us and not her
1055351700 [12621] <pam/#webco> it is suppose to work that way, so =bug
1055351722 [12625] <pam/#webco> i certainly thought it should so I didn't tell her there was anyting wrong with that approach
1055351791 [12631] <pam/#webco> sorry man
1055351850 [12647] <pam/#webco> i'm going to call ellen and give her the choice of reinstall and up soon or longer and clean up and delay
1055352696 [12693] <pam/#webco> my computer = suckie
1055354021 [12707] <pam/#webco> hey hey
1055354054 [12711] <pam/#webco> ok :) why now
1055354088 [12715] <pam/#webco> and bugging you in the process?
1055354130 [12723] <pam/#webco> yeah, and he makes sure we get paid, which is nice, not that that is the only reason we love him
1055354166 [12729] <pam/#webco> ok, gone long?  ping when back and we can go over support dealios
1055357330 [12807] <pam/#webco> josh: accd on the phone, they want to do upgrade on weekend now and they now feel they deserve it, what do you think?
1055357372 [12825] <pam/#webco> what is better for you? rik says saturday morning is better but they could do either
1055357407 [12833] <pam/#webco> uh, they were down this morning when they thought we upgrading them :)

1055357544 [12859] <pam/#webco> not open on sunday, rick is going to go in for it, so he would like to do it in the morning
1055357736 [12871] <pam/#webco> ok, quote from rick "ok as long as he walks in on monday and things work and nothing blows up....."
1055358075 [12885] <pam/#webco> rick torres
1055358112 [12887] <pam/#webco> ok, got off phone with ellen at ithaca, she says to go ahead and just wipe and reinstall and import the spreadsheet, weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
1055358269 [12897] <pam/#webco> no problemo, rick is a maniac work martyr and thinks every one should be, i told him to chill
1055358283 [12903] <pam/#webco> gots ya back
1055360377 [12924] <pam/#webco> groovy thanks
1055360385 [12926] <pam/#webco> yep
1055372020 [13274] <pam/#webco> josh: you still around
1055373715 [13300] <pam/#webco> me too
1055522230 [15208] <pam/#webco> hola
1055522757 [15285] <pam/#webco> ignatius: did you see email from Anita at LCC and does that mean we can turn their patron integration back on?
1055523045 [15298] <pam/#webco> ignatius: thanks, it came in on wed when you were off I think
1055523588 [15306] <pam/#webco> yes
1055523616 [15310] <pam/#webco> hm, I don't think it is that ambiguous and if you feel it is then you can reply and clarify or I can and let you know
1055523674 [15322] <pam/#webco> ]exactly
1055526726 [15448] <pam/#webco> ignatius: i don't think you should spend any time with the Ithaca holiday thing and leave to be fixed in a future release since the workaround for ellen it pretty easy, i emailed her btw
1055526979 [15451] <pam/#webco> ignatius: is that accd tool crib resource file still loaded at that url from your email from 6/3?
1055527303 [15460] <pam/#webco> ignatius: ok, I will call them to see what is up, I have sent two emails with no response
1055528719 [15467] <pam/#webco> josh: did you do something to ucb after email from alberto about no resource came in?  i see their resources fine, did he smokey some cracky this morning?
1055528763 [15477] <pam/#webco> i'll email albertro back
1055530362 [15485] <pam/#webco> shoot, i was in syracuse instance and now it is not responding, just hanging browser, can someone take a look for me?
1055530449 [15489] <pam/#webco> oh wait, just came back but took a lonooooooong time
1055530455 [15491] <pam/#webco> weird
1055531121 [15503] <pam/#webco> hi craig
1055532637 [15588] <pam/#webco> josh: did you see response from alberto?  he can't see resources but we can
1055532815 [15596] <pam/#webco> how could that happen?
1055533041 [15602] <pam/#webco> they only have one and then the webcheckout default
1055533224 [15618] <pam/#webco> ok, maybe i will give him a callio
1055534531 [15662] <pam/#webco> is the fact that the contents tab clears out all data of an order is cancelled a bug or a feature?
1055534641 [15674] <pam/#webco> there is the list on the left that stays in tact listing the resource but the contents tab becomes a blank grey screen, hence ucb problem of not being able to go back and add a charge thro a cancelled order
1055534646 [15676] <pam/#webco> webfuckit
1055534714 [15688] <pam/#webco> ok
1055534856 [15694] <pam/#webco> man bugzilla is slooooooww today
1055534899 [15696] <pam/#webco> the recharge/non-recharge flip happened  when we gave them a testing instance and i think lee fixed it once
1055535303 [15709] <pam/#webco> josh: i don't think it was that late in the game
1055535311 [15712] <pam/#webco> is lee around?
1055536029 [15744] <pam/#webco> josh: old bug for same problem bug #5288
1055536236 [15758] <pam/#webco> josh: the recharge/non-recharge issue
1055537530 [15805] <pam/#webco> feexed alberto problemo
1055537564 [15811] <pam/#webco> his station some how became a station in webcheckout instead of dwin
1055538809 [15885] <pam/#webco> good luck with that
1055541531 [15970] <pam/#webco> josh: what is the status of the ucb thingys?
1055541546 [15972] <pam/#webco> richard just called and said he was sending faxes with more bugs on it, sigh
1055541770 [15981] <pam/#webco> yeah, holly will send over to me as pdfs
1055542053 [16007] <pam/#webco> yeah, i think i did, i will double check
1055542072 [16009] <pam/#webco> yep
1055784200 [16721] <pam/#webco> adam: are we not going to get max a testable instance of 3.1 anymore?  I noticed you closed the bug on his instance on friday saying they weren't going to be testing
1055784885 [16779] <pam/#webco> ignatius: utah is taken care of, It was just cache memory setting issue
1055785776 [16840] <pam/#webco> ignatius: clark is going to do some cleaning up on his resource structure and resend file, we can load when we have time, his is not being pushing
1055792208 [17174] <pam/#webco> ignatius: can you send update on the accd issues to support list so I can be up to date on the dealio with them?
1055809091 [17797] <pam/#webco> adam: I will test the invoice search bug on demo and let you know what i find
1055809270 [17800] <pam/#webco> it's a bug in 3.0.3; tested on beta and got same behavior, i will add comment to the bug
1055809373 [17804] <pam/#webco> np
1055809394 [17807] <pam/#webco> ok, me go home now
1055809407 [17813] <pam/#webco> how was tennis?
1055809425 [17822] <pam/#webco> did you really play or just drink ice tea and sit on the court
1055809459 [17828] <pam/#webco> nice
1055809474 [17832] <pam/#webco> who was the ball boy?
1055809512 [17844] <pam/#webco> at least you are evenly matched
1055809545 [17852] <pam/#webco> sweet, did you hit any cars or small childre
1055809558 [17858] <pam/#webco> damn
1055809581 [17864] <pam/#webco> it's his own fault for haning out at the tennis court
1055809608 [17868] <pam/#webco> ok, outtie, tomorrow is another day to put out ucb and accd fires, weeeeeeeeeeee
1055809642 [17875] <pam/#webco> it's really not that bad anymore, i am being dramatic, but it is more fun that way
1055809675 [17888] <pam/#webco> hehe
1055809686 [17890] <pam/#webco> ok, piece out
1055870282 [18546] <pam/#webco> shit, my email is not working
1055870382 [18557] <pam/#webco> yeah, getting some weird errors back sometimes
1055870789 [18599] <pam/#webco> sigh, i need help, keep getting msg from mail server that can not send mail because an address is too long or malformed even tho they are correct addresses, the test I sent to support worked fine 
1055871058 [18638] <pam/#webco> ayres: i can't copy and past from the error, it says what I typed in irc, starts with Error while sending from <<Dominant>> then says address is too long or mailformed, cannot send to that address
1055871200 [18656] <pam/#webco> ayres: that is all the error says, do you want to come look at it?
1055871260 [18666] <pam/#webco> ayres: i tried sending the same email four times to get the error and now they all whent through together and was delivered four times
1055872067 [18691] <pam/#webco> josh: we need to install RPI server and send back, can i milestone a bug to support for that?
1055872126 [18699] <pam/#webco> ok, when can we fit it in to our current support back log, i have mtg with client in 20 min and would like to tell them when we can install
1055872178 [18708] <pam/#webco> josh: no, we have a very short turn around on this client
1055872322 [18720] <pam/#webco> ignatius: we need to get that server down there installed with red hat and webcheckout to send back to RPI
1055872370 [18726] <pam/#webco> ignatius: well, as soon as possible, when can you fit it in?
1055872389 [18732] <pam/#webco> now is good :)
1055872420 [18743] <pam/#webco> ignatius: i will open bug and assign to you
1055872545 [18751] <pam/#webco> ignatius: what are you working on now? is it more of a hot issue than this install?
1055872690 [18773] <pam/#webco> josh: sorry i have not had time to order, if need is that urgent than microcenter should do the deed
1055872787 [18784] <pam/#webco> ignatius: ok, i would say to finish the squeaky wheel client issues, such as the accd thing you are working on, before starting the install, if we can get it in the next couple of days that should be good
1055872802 [18788] <pam/#webco> josh: who makes the call on urgency?
1055872967 [18822] <pam/#webco> josh: i about to get pulled into a meeting that will last about an hour so I cannot respond to support, leave what ever is for 1st level for me and I will caught up afta
1055873216 [18853] <pam/#webco> ignatius: i  could not assign bug #5621 to you, can you just accept it please
1055875610 [19118] <pam/#webco> josh: i filed bug for this error issue with ucb a long time ago, every client complains and it is painful to explain it to them, someone moved the milestone of the bug to 3.1.x, do you think I can remilestone for 3.0.5 or something?
1055875649 [19125] <pam/#webco> bug #5243
1055875815 [19129] <pam/#webco> yes, that would help, it would be more helpful to say has prior commitment on ck# whatever or something, but if it is easer to do unavailable for pickup that is fine too
1055875844 [19137] <pam/#webco> that would make me happy and i know how badly you want me to be happy :)
1055876305 [19148] <pam/#webco> adam: looked good, consulted with airdri and made small change and noted the bug
1055876649 [19168] <pam/#webco> accd is on the phone, they are down
1055877287 [19216] <pam/#webco> josh: rik says that a lot of their active patrons are now listed as inactive, would any of the integration code get affected by the upgrade or is it something they need to contact their IT person about?
1055877340 [19220] <pam/#webco> accd and ubc upgrades at the same time = support suicide
1055877359 [19228] <pam/#webco> me too, after :)
1055877383 [19240] <pam/#webco> yep
1055877391 [19244] <pam/#webco> ok
1055877404 [19246] <pam/#webco> they are sending list of 3.0 stuff that is 'wrong', o joy
1055877418 [19252] <pam/#webco> sure thing
1055877899 [19276] <pam/#webco> josh: is there a setting that the user can set the amount of time until a session times out?
1055878509 [19295] <pam/#webco> ignatius: is there some reason they are coming in as inactive to the user then?
1055878775 [19303] <pam/#webco> uhhh, try all :() patron look to be inactive in accd interface, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1055878826 [19307] <pam/#webco> ayres: it looks like all are being sent
1055878894 [19313] <pam/#webco> ignatius: it appears that there are 14 patrons in accd with the status of active, ones they have probably changed themselves today so they can make reservations to them
1055878899 [19315] <pam/#webco> accd hates us
1055878976 [19321] <pam/#webco> hm, no so I don't know why 14 are active, maybe they are ones they added to the system outside of the integration
1055878982 [19324] <pam/#webco> duh
1055879125 [19345] <pam/#webco> ok, well they are all inactive from the file, including the 3505 that should be active, only the 14 local ones are active
1055879212 [19349] <pam/#webco> look at the interface, none come up active
1055879241 [19351] <pam/#webco> except the 14
1055879472 [19359] <pam/#webco> grrr
1055879503 [19363] <pam/#webco> if you do a search and limit the max results to say 3000 it only returns 14 active users so to the user it looks like there are no active patrons
1055879510 [19365] <pam/#webco> it is a differnt bug, not integration
1055879552 [19371] <pam/#webco> if you do a search for 30000 max results it will pull the whole db and give you the correct results but you have to know how many bad records the system is throwing away before you can run an effective search
1055879798 [19393] <pam/#webco> can i get a developer to repond to the support email about msu server so they can purchase their server, email subject: [Fwd: Red Hat question]
1055882404 [19505] <pam/#webco> josh: is there currently any bug reports that you know of for 3.0.3 that say restrictions on rtypes not working?
1055882546 [19523] <pam/#webco> josh: yeah, i think its broken, must do testing, oy
1055883859 [19654] <pam/#webco> josh: there is a problem on ithaca instace, there are three rtypes that are not picking up authorization restrictions even though it turned on, all others turned on as well but the system is picking them up just fine, sigh, i will file boooooogggg, weirdy tho
1055884094 [19662] <pam/#webco> josh: would that be production instance or group authorization?
1055885408 [19868] <pam/#webco> fuck fuck fuck accd is missing a big chunk of their rtype heirarchy in the applet
1055885423 [19872] <pam/#webco> josh can you please come upstairs and look at what I am seeing so i can talk to you about it?
1055886247 [19995] <pam/#webco> josh: left rik a msg, let you know when he calls back
1055886251 [20000] <pam/#webco> i need a drink
1055886361 [20031] <pam/#webco> i am sure as long as he could join me
1055886939 [20127] <pam/#onshored> is prep now called ghostface killer?
1055886954 [20131] <pam/#onshored> i don't see prep in the chooser but i see ghostface killer
1055886969 [20133] <pam/#onshored> prep is where i back up to, or did
1055886987 [20141] <pam/#onshored> hm
1055886993 [20143] <pam/#onshored> where is prep then?
1055887001 [20145] <pam/#onshored> i hate my life today
1055887009 [20153] <pam/#onshored> hehe
1055887878 [20230] <pam/#webco> josh: ucb complaining about cancelled reservation in set/strike, already filed at bug #5596 which is currently milestoned for 3.0.4, do you think this will really get addressed here or moved to 3.0.5?
1055887956 [20232] <pam/#webco> josh: i still dont' see prep in appletalk, do i need to restart?
1055887969 [20238] <pam/#webco> i mean the chooser
1055887980 [20242] <pam/#webco> ok, i will let air-dry know
1055889864 [20489] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i am about to order equipment, josh said earlier there may be a need to get the disk drive from microcenter to be faster, do you think that is true or should i just order
1055890069 [20506] <pam/#webco> sorry, phone call, back with you in a min
1055890677 [20539] <pam/#webco> gracchus: ok, back, you mean to order all parts from newegg instead of two orders? is doesn't matter to me
1055890702 [20545] <pam/#webco> that's cool
1055890724 [20555] <pam/#webco> i'll let you know when they should arrive, any reason to send more expensive shipping method or is ground ok?
1055890803 [20562] <pam/#webco> ok, a little more than getting at the other place but it may make up for it in shipping all together instead of seperate
1055890815 [20566] <pam/#webco> cool
1055890823 [20570] <pam/#webco> i like free
1055892226 [20707] <pam/#webco> crap, newegg is a pain to ship to an adress that is not the billing address of the credit card, if I order from them i can't do it until thursday when I can get eric to add onshore address to his ccard
1055892373 [20719] <pam/#webco> i think i can use other card, i'll let you know if i run into trouble
1055892714 [20731] <pam/#webco> ok, put the order in, I will let you know if they come back with any problemos
1055892746 [20734] <pam/#webco> this is the first time i have had a problem with a vendor not allowing shipping to address different from cc billing address too
1055894037 [20883] <pam/#webco> looks like newegg order went through ok so should be here by early next week
1055894059 [20888] <pam/#webco> no problemo, sorry for the delay
1055894166 [20899] <pam/#webco> adam: there has been an outstanding question from msu about their server on support email, can you respond so they can get their server?  header  [Fwd: Red Hat question]
1055894182 [20901] <pam/#webco> josh deferred to development staff
1055894257 [20907] <pam/#webco> i dont' understand that question adam
1055894338 [20920] <pam/#webco> oh, they already confirmed the size of the server they are ordering in previous email, this is just about os
1055894516 [20934] <pam/#webco> yeah, 3.1, thanks adam
1055894884 [20959] <pam/#webco> josh!
1055894916 [20973] <pam/#webco> josh: i talked to rik at accd, if you need to get take them down to pull the indexes then either tonight when theya re closed or first thing in the morning should be ok

1055895131 [21000] <pam/#webco> i don't think he has ever committed, sometimes he seems to take fridays, sometimes wed
1055895159 [21002] <pam/#webco> but i made sure he was going to be here tomorrow
1055895364 [21014] <pam/#webco> i am down with that, does it cause a problem this week?
1055895394 [21022] <pam/#webco> sure thing
1055895456 [21038] <pam/#webco> josh: cbl has seemed reluctant to set a day but I may be reading him wrong, I am sure he would go on tuesdays if we push him on it, or whatever set day
1055895473 [21045] <pam/#webco> o right
1055895482 [21047] <pam/#webco> i try to block that out
1055895513 [21053] <pam/#webco> start playing loud music...
1055895840 [21112] <pam/#webco> adam: i didn't get your resonse to the redhat question, did you cc support on it?
1055895898 [21122] <pam/#webco> thank you
1055895936 [21130] <pam/#webco> ok, really going home this time
1056038525 [24694] <pam/#webco> josh rules

1056038574 [24711] <pam/#webco> is there something going on with evergreen?  
1056038588 [24717] <pam/#webco> i got two msg from wyatt wanting to know if they can use their system
1056038633 [24730] <pam/#webco> i havn't read my mail yet from yesterday
1056040160 [24835] <pam/#webco> josh: ok, i just got all the way tho yesterdays evergeen emails, damn, I have to call wyatt back, you think they are goog to go right?
1056040271 [24845] <pam/#webco> ew, no, so they set it and then we un-set it based on wyatts request?
1056040291 [24847] <pam/#webco> was there an email on that?
1056040421 [24859] <pam/#webco> josh: wait, i'm confused, was there a migration bug or did they have auto-circulate on b/f update?
1056040488 [24865] <pam/#webco> oy
1056040526 [24869] <pam/#webco> oh, cool :)
1056040800 [24873] <pam/#webco> josh: alberto from baylor email a couple days ago asking is 3.0 is stable enough for them, silly alberto, when you want me to try and schedule them?
1056040886 [24881] <pam/#webco> josh: we have a little backlog of imports to do too, accd, uw, RPI will send theirs by monday
1056040901 [24885] <pam/#webco> i don't think they are, should I tell him to ping us in a couple of weeks?
1056040920 [24889] <pam/#webco> ok
1056040931 [24893] <pam/#webco> absolutly
1056041144 [24905] <pam/#webco> josh: bug #5617 is milestoned for 3.0.5, ucb has sent it in three seperate times so they are hitting it a lot in their workflow, any chance it can get bumped up to 3.0.4 or is it too late?
1056041328 [24925] <pam/#webco> hmm, well maybe they can go with the fix and if they bitch too much we may have to patch them b/f 3.0.5 but we can see
1056041342 [24927] <pam/#webco> i meant without the fix
1056041727 [24934] <pam/#webco> adam: there is an unanswered support email from alex at saic that seems like a question for you or craigB, subject: intermittant SAIC server problem, sent on Tuesday
1056043275 [25040] <pam/#webco> josh: i have laurie on phone from sfsu, she is trying to set up her printer, but can't get it to print, its now past my knowledge, do you have a min to talk to her?
1056043288 [25046] <pam/#webco> adam: ok, a craigB thning then
1056043316 [25053] <pam/#webco> 4pm your time it that still works
1056043366 [25064] <pam/#webco> adam: sure, 3pm your time then
1056043427 [25072] <pam/#webco> that will work for her, she will figure it out
1056046219 [25122] <pam/#webco> josh: when you have a chance please review dave c's latest email and give me your opinion please
1056047576 [25130] <pam/#webco> josh: sent dave email, he left off support
1056047988 [25144] <pam/#webco> adam: you around?
1056051873 [25202] <pam/#webco> why why why can accd work without setting up stations!!!!!!!! we need to turn that off again for them, grrrrrr
1056052073 [25208] <pam/#webco> they had the stupid custom thing to take away the ability create stations which f(*^ks up printing and it was lost in the upgrade, i think cbl filed a bug for it
1056052097 [25212] <pam/#webco> so now they keep creating stations even tho we have told them a billion times not to
1056052636 [25227] <pam/#webco> josh: i tried to do a serach for photo as the type in accd find types form and is appears to have hung them
1056052670 [25229] <pam/#webco> please help
1056052835 [25231] <pam/#webco> they are back
1056052876 [25241] <pam/#webco> i don't knwo
1056052893 [25245] <pam/#webco> i don't know
1056052895 [25250] <pam/#webco> i don't know
1056052901 [25253] <pam/#webco> aughhhhhhj
1056054569 [25398] <pam/#webco> o my god accd is sooo slow everywhere, much slower after upgrade
1056054599 [25404] <pam/#webco> much slower than before upgrade i mean
1056054634 [25408] <pam/#webco> in general, just changing pages, doing most searches, drilling through ther hierarchy is painful
1056054953 [25413] <pam/#webco> they are complaining and i am noticing
1056056088 [25478] <pam/#webco> so you can't take something offline for repair if it is non-circulating? is that a bug or a feature?
1056056326 [25498] <pam/#webco> well, its kinda conected to components too, in 2.0.x if you made something a component the system made it non-circulating, now it appers in 3.0.x it stays circulating
1056056332 [25500] <pam/#webco> which makes sense and it a good thing, I think
1056056367 [25502] <pam/#webco> but it only happens moving forward so accd has a ton of stuff in kits that was migrated in as non-circulating
1056056390 [25504] <pam/#webco> so now they can't take those items offline for repair unless they go in and take them out of the kit and make them circulating
1056056397 [25506] <pam/#webco> this is making my head hurt
1056056493 [25514] <pam/#webco> well, yes they are if circulating means leaving the checkout center and going someplace else, they do, they just aren't the Resource ID that you choose in webco
1056056538 [25516] <pam/#webco> ok, then the bug is that now if you make something a component it stays as ciruculating
1056129318 [27271] <pam/#webco> hey
1056129332 [27273] <pam/#webco> adam: today is fine for a status mtg
1056129339 [27275] <pam/#webco> what time works for you 
1056129345 [27277] <pam/#webco> later in the afternoon is better for me
1056129482 [27284] <pam/#webco> adam: ok, 4pm your time?
1056130297 [27330] <pam/#webco> josh: what was in Frank Tate's voicemail to you today?
1056130867 [27354] <pam/#webco> josh: thats cool I just wanted to know his tone, he is going to be high maint. and seems a little panic-Y.  I am sending an email to him and just wanted to sooth his little webcheckout soul again
1056130909 [27359] <pam/#webco> ok
1056130990 [27367] <pam/#webco> yeah, that is the case, your email was good, as long as he knows it all gonna be ok, i do wish dan had not told him they would get 3.1 tho
1056131153 [27382] <pam/#webco> josh: ok, cool, I would rather start them on 3.0 anyway
1056131520 [27405] <pam/#webco> oy, are you on with him now?
1056131526 [27407] <pam/#webco> or did he leave a msg?
1056131615 [27413] <pam/#webco> what is the problem, user stuff you don't know about?
1056131625 [27418] <pam/#webco> k
1056131629 [27420] <pam/#webco> send
1056133949 [27664] <pam/#webco> when you see the "Reservation can be picked up in 6 days 2 hours" thing in the Override section of an allocation, is that really associated with an override or is it just a warning?
1056134285 [27741] <pam/#webco> ignatius: what is the status of the RPI install on that server down there?
1056134305 [27745] <pam/#webco> you did not update the bug
1056134616 [27776] <pam/#webco> josh: no response yet to dave c's question about datamart to support yesterday, any idea on that?
1056136937 [28097] <pam/#webco> josh: that behavior is still a bug tho, if you hit an override you can't move through the reservation should not require the operator to reset, it should still have the pickup reservation options, don't you think?
1056137044 [28105] <pam/#webco> hehe
1056137086 [28111] <pam/#webco> my job would be so much worse without you!
1056138818 [28243] <pam/#webco> ignatius: i called rpi, they are all our for the day so we will see on monday if we will send back server or what, I don't really care which way we do it, dan told them we could load it all up here and ship it back so now that is what they want, i am sure i can get them to agree to remote data load
1056148676 [28948] <pam/#webco> be back later
1056387023 [29376] <pam/#webco> ignatius: what is on your to do list today?
1056389190 [29400] <pam/#webco> cbl: please call Jim Evans at RPI to discuss connectivity to their server at 518.276.4826
1056389768 [29413] <pam/#webco> kreig: talked to Kelly stack, ucla, adam had asked me to see if it was ok if we had the 3.1 testing instance down in the morning for any kind of maint and they could test in the afternoon but it actually works better for them to have testing in the morning and have us take it down in the afternoon, is that ok with you?
1056389847 [29423] <pam/#webco> kreig: i know, they are going to meeting tues-fri at 8am to go over 3.1 testing so that is really the time that they need access
1056389881 [29428] <pam/#webco> kreig: they don't care if we take over in the afternoon, they are too busy to test then anyway
1056389887 [29430] <pam/#webco> sweet
1056390021 [29434] <pam/#webco> ok
1056390772 [29441] <pam/#webco> cbl: i have already responded to marc at lcc twice, did you not see those emails?
1056390777 [29443] <pam/#webco> hi joshy
1056390826 [29447] <pam/#webco> cbl: so they are already scheduled, i opened a bug and they are good to go
1056390910 [29449] <pam/#webco> josh: denver just emailed me requesting upgrade to 3.0, should I put them off a couple of weeks?
1056391018 [29460] <pam/#webco> I am in the process of organizing all the problems for those two clients, no whining yet today, thank god, just some outstanding issues that were milestoned for 3.0.5, I will forward my checklist for them when they are done so we can stay on track 
1056391056 [29466] <pam/#webco> saic is down, what is the process for them now
1056391107 [29476] <pam/#webco> you mean all 2.0.x to 3.0.4 or just 3.0.x to 3.0.4
1056391154 [29481] <pam/#webco> josh: ok, if I have time today i will make a list and check it twice
1056391173 [29485] <pam/#webco> k
1056391179 [29493] <pam/#webco> sure
1056391189 [29495] <pam/#webco> just a reminder that i am out starting wed for the rest of the week

1056391618 [29561] <pam/#webco> alex said they came back up
1056391694 [29571] <pam/#webco> that really pisses me off that they all would leave me without second level support, i have asked a couple of times already for them not to do that, its not nice to first level support 
1056391808 [29577] <pam/#webco> that is not true, if he left and kreig b was here it would be fine, at least I would be covered
1056392980 [29587] <pam/#webco> big spanking for developers, i'm comin down with the paddle right now
1056392993 [29589] <pam/#webco> kreig: thank you, i would appreciate that

1056474732 [30551] <pam/#webco> josh: evergreen loudest, accd close second
1056474797 [30559] <pam/#webco> josh: cbl just responded to evergreen so they are taken care of, accd next on the list
1056474823 [30561] <pam/#webco> josh: two big issues with them, first, can we get the create station button off their log in page
1056474853 [30574] <pam/#webco> josh: second big issues is that there are some speed issues with 3.0.3, both accd and evergreen complained and I notice a lag on both of their instnaces
1056474911 [30582] <pam/#webco> is it possible that the upgrades wiped out any of the optimization work that was done for both of them in the past?
1056474956 [30592] <pam/#webco> ok, well it's purtty ugly, take a look at either and you can see a lag
1056474996 [30602] <pam/#webco> resource drop down in applet is the biggy
1056475032 [30610] <pam/#webco> kreig: what is "my" standard procedure for performance problems
1056475065 [30622] <pam/#webco> hehe
1056475080 [30633] <pam/#webco> you better duck
1056475105 [30641] <pam/#webco> cbl: i would love to
1056475127 [30647] <pam/#webco> nope, i'll take a look
1056475196 [30670] <pam/#webco> kreig: as soon as I figure out how to clone myself I will have to time to read our documentation, in the mean time I will file bugs :)
1056476397 [30727] <pam/#webco> cbl: there is a problem with the rpi load, it looks like all the resources made it in but the entire resource heirarchy is not appearing in the applet
1056476456 [30732] <pam/#webco> the data is there, it is not populating the applet correctly
1056476468 [30736] <pam/#webco> it is an application problme, not a data file problme
1056478113 [30783] <pam/#webco> thanks cbl, i'll contact jim evans again and let you know when we can load up their server
1056478264 [30788] <pam/#webco> josh: uof fl is fine to upgrade to 3.0.4 any time
1056478287 [30798] <pam/#webco> cbl: can you give me url again
1056478388 [30805] <pam/#webco> cbl: i am still seeing the same problem in the applet, Projector - lcd- high res only, missing low and medium
1056478536 [30811] <pam/#webco> then what is the deal with you telling me it was fixed? did i miss understand?
1056478664 [30822] <pam/#webco> ok, but i am looking at the one example I gave you and it is not fixed
1056478702 [30824] <pam/#webco> did you upload the fix to the staged instance? is that a stupid question?
1056480691 [30844] <pam/#webco> ayres: can you look at that fedex slip on the rpi server and tell me what they listed the value at pls?
1056480775 [30854] <pam/#webco> poop
1056480792 [30856] <pam/#webco> maybe 1000 for the server? 2000? educated guesses pls
1056480900 [30869] <pam/#webco> no, they are paying
1056481708 [30882] <pam/#webco> josh: around? have second level support call from usc
1056481713 [30884] <pam/#webco> or cbl can take?
1056482590 [30904] <pam/#webco> crap, can josh or cbl take a look at accd printers not printing again for some reason
1056482609 [30910] <pam/#webco> thx
1056483188 [30949] <pam/#webco> yes, pls communicate with rik
1056483935 [30969] <pam/#webco> josh: is evergreen scheduled for 3.0.4 upgrade in the morning? i can't keep em all straight, i thought they were but now i don't see a bug for it
1056484064 [30971] <pam/#webco> i guess I just imagined that I scheduled it with him.  Josh, do you want me to try to schedule this for tomorrow morning?
1056490182 [31014] <pam/#webco> why when ever I talk to accd I am on the phone for over an hour, waaaaaaaaaaa
1056490201 [31016] <pam/#webco> make them stop
1056490371 [31024] <pam/#webco> ok, can i get off support for the rest of the day and leave to josh and cbl?  i have to get some other things done b/f i fly outta here
1056494586 [31199] <pam/#webco> ok, gotta go, back on monday, call on cell phone if you need me
1056494622 [31205] <pam/#webco> just put your phone on fwd mail!
1056988081 [37803] <pam/#webco> cbl: rpi is on the phone, server is not booting again, can you take the call?
1056989151 [37821] <pam/#webco> cbl: help, accd is down
1056989263 [37826] <pam/#webco> jim evans: 518.276.4826
1056989843 [37902] <pam/#webco> i would like to tell them what it is they are doing that keeps haning them
1056989851 [37906] <pam/#webco> they think it is us and our server of course
1056989915 [37914] <pam/#webco> hmmm, so if one of our round the clock clients goes down on fri or sat we don't help them?  i thought we do as a part of our contract
1056989930 [37918] <pam/#webco> true, josh should not be sole responsible for emergency situations
1056989971 [37930] <pam/#webco> hehe
1056990117 [37938] <pam/#webco> josh: what time do you think those emergency requests came in on friday?
1056990290 [37948] <pam/#webco> did they get any response from us until now?
1056990299 [37952] <pam/#webco> i haven't gotten throu my email yet
1056990443 [37962] <pam/#webco> well, i am not looking for fault and I certainly don't think you should be responsible for emergency stuff 24/7, its not fair.  you should get to not think about webcheckout all weekend if you don't want to, we just need to manage client expectations against what we can do
1056990542 [37973] <pam/#webco> tru, is there any way to tell what accd keeps doing to tie up their server?
1056990588 [37979] <pam/#webco> crap, they are not responding again
1056990676 [37988] <pam/#webco> loading the applet holds up the server this bad?
1056991528 [38062] <pam/#webco> josh: how long do we need their server?
1056991580 [38074] <pam/#webco> ok, they are schedueled for upgrade first thing in the morning
1056991623 [38084] <pam/#webco> should we get it done today instead?
1056991633 [38090] <pam/#webco> i should call them to let them know we are taking them down
1056991643 [38093] <pam/#webco> how long will the fix take?
1056991660 [38099] <pam/#webco> ok, calling rick
1056991738 [38101] <pam/#webco> ok, they are aware, take it away
1056992219 [38116] <pam/#webco> thanks josh, i will let them know.  They are scheduled to upgrade first thing in the morning and need to be up by 10am our time
1056992265 [38123] <pam/#webco> josh: what is your opinion on baylor getting upgrade from 2.0.x to 3.0.4, they keep asking, want to put off another week or schedule?
1056992374 [38129] <pam/#webco> more of a workload issue, 3.0.4 seems purtty goot, I didn't get a single wco error while training, a first!
1056992400 [38139] <pam/#webco> because they want it, nothing more
1056992421 [38143] <pam/#webco> they have sap integration tho so they may be an issue?
1056992521 [38156] <pam/#webco> ok, we can put off for a bit, should we do some testing of an upgrade for them before sending them live to avoid any repeats of ucb/evergreen/accd?
1056992553 [38162] <pam/#webco> ok, we can talk tomorrow when you are *really* working and make a plan
1056993109 [38177] <pam/#webco> thanks for your help josh
1056993681 [38197] <pam/#webco> thanks cbl, can you let me know when the rpi upgrade and resource load is complete so I can call our friend jim
1056993943 [38213] <pam/#webco> cbl: i am confused by your stmt about resource load, there were some issues with the load into 3.0.3, that will be fixed by the upgrade w/o having to reload the resources?
1056996417 [38257] <pam/#webco> crap
1056998289 [38322] <pam/#webco> cbl: yeah, sent to support, i think the date of the file is inthe bug, i can look if you need me to
1056998354 [38325] <pam/#webco> bug 5621 has the files you attached to it
1056998396 [38330] <pam/#webco> oh, sorry misunderstood
1056998399 [38332] <pam/#webco> yeah, i have it
1056998409 [38340] <pam/#webco> sure
1056998770 [38353] <pam/#webco> cbl: try the file i just sent to support
1057001904 [38407] <pam/#webco> wah wah wah
1057004733 [38417] <pam/#webco> cbl: can you tell anything about the ithaca problem that just came in from ellen?
1057004753 [38421] <pam/#webco> maybe i should just call her, i can't follow her email
1057005762 [38443] <pam/#webco> cbl: just talked to ellen, she has spent the day adding resources and making them contained by other resources and around 2:30 her time the system started freezing up on her as she explained in the email
1057005784 [38454] <pam/#webco> cbl: can we check the server logs to see if anything strange happened.  I can even give you the resource she was on when the trouble started
1057005813 [38459] <pam/#webco> josh: he misses you today
1057006083 [38473] <pam/#webco> DSR-80 3A
1057006437 [38509] <pam/#webco> cbl: i can send a list to support of all the resources she created starting with dsr-80 3a which is when she started getting problems.  the server freezes occured during resource creation and making resources contain other resources
1057006485 [38511] <pam/#webco> cbl: when she closed the browser and reopened it seemed to let her log back in and continue
1057006502 [38515] <pam/#webco> not the normal behavior of when the server is busy
1057006512 [38517] <pam/#webco> some kind of browser issue maybe?
1057006569 [38525] <pam/#webco> weird that she worked all morning in it fine and then this afternoon had the problems
1057006575 [38527] <pam/#webco> cbl: already verified that
1057006905 [38556] <pam/#webco> cbl: what kind of info do you need on the resources she created? just ids or their ids and rtypes? or a time when the problem started?
1057006924 [38558] <pam/#webco> shouldn't operator logins be part of the system event log?
1057006932 [38562] <pam/#webco> 3:04 eastern
1057007171 [38574] <pam/#webco> uh, ithaca is in new york so they should be eastern
1057007195 [38581] <pam/#webco> ok, good, 
1057007544 [38593] <pam/#webco> she claimed when I was on the phone with her that she just let it run a couple of times to see if it would come back and it didn't, she said 10 min but i am sure that is an overestimate
1057010132 [38623] <pam/#webco> thanks cbl
1057081305 [39231] <pam/#webco> cbl: hey man, what the dealio with the ithaca server problem, can we tell anything from the profiling you turned on yesterday?
1057081391 [39235] <pam/#webco> ok, would it help if I did some testing on their instance or do you have enough info to move forward?
1057081430 [39239] <pam/#webco> ok, i'll bang at it and see if i can recreate their reports
1057081456 [39245] <pam/#webco> no
1057081502 [39249] <pam/#webco> k
1057084464 [39288] <pam/#webco> cbl: i just banged at ithaca for 20 min straight with no lag or strange behavior, i tried all combiantions they sent in plus lots of my own, no success in recreating
1057084614 [39296] <pam/#webco> cbl: ok, here is what I know, they are on Windows XP running IE 6, had them check their caching settings, all set to refresh every time, what next? memory? browser memory should be set to what to you think?
1057084842 [39307] <pam/#webco> i can call and ask ellen if she know how much ram is on their machines, isn't is weird that the behavior just popped up yesterday afternoon if she has been working on entering data for a couple of weeks now tho?
1057084855 [39310] <pam/#webco> are there any other questions I should ask her while i am on the phone with her
1057084935 [39327] <pam/#webco> josh: yeah i tried all combinations of moving around, including bread crumb link, icons and even the browser back button, although i am on a mac
1057085033 [39338] <pam/#webco> could someone who is more technical call ellen to get info about computer configuration?
1057085044 [39340] <pam/#webco> cbl? do you mind?
1057085076 [39344] <pam/#webco> thank you, she is in the contacts section of projex
1057091615 [39587] <pam/#webco> kreig: i am updating vaction/sick time, can you forward email with the days you took over the last couple of weeks please
1057091676 [39591] <pam/#webco> ok
1057093169 [39667] <pam/#webco> adam: there is an email from accd from victor emerson regarding resource import with several questions addressed to me that I could use some help with, can you help me, pls?
1057093290 [39673] <pam/#webco> well its about liability if they do their own rtype import and can they do if we host their server
1057093728 [39700] <pam/#webco> adam: wco-import
1057094065 [39707] <pam/#webco> cbl: there is a support email from Bryan at UP last Thursday about schedule error that you responded to but I don't see any follow up, did that get resolved?
1057094085 [39709] <pam/#webco> adam: sorry, I can shoot it to one of them instead then
1057094115 [39717] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1057097108 [39984] <pam/#webco> yeah
1057097273 [39994] <pam/#webco> just didn't know where to put it i guess
1057097280 [39997] <pam/#webco> didn't mean to confuse
1057097308 [39999] <pam/#webco> i have just gotten into the habit of milestoning all the bugs i file
1057097711 [40002] <pam/#webco> i need to respond to alberto about his request to go to 3.0, should we schedule a staged instance of this upgrade first to test the sap integration work?
1057097720 [40004] <pam/#webco> cbl said yesterday he had started something with them
1057097728 [40006] <pam/#webco> with the sap integration i mean
1057097752 [40012] <pam/#webco> ok, what kind of schedule do we give him?  when do you want to start that josh?
1057097850 [40026] <pam/#webco> me neither, there seems to be several support emails from when i was in florida that got missed that I am trying to get caught up on
1057097865 [40028] <pam/#webco> what do you mean by that? UBC?
1057097879 [40034] <pam/#webco> oh, UBC, not ucb
1057097882 [40036] <pam/#webco> doh
1057097913 [40040] <pam/#webco> that is still on my, I havn't gotten a hold of them to see where they are, maybe I should do that now since they are on a holiday today :)
1057097940 [40044] <pam/#webco> crap
1057097950 [40046] <pam/#webco> they didn't ping us so I guess they didn't notice either
1057097995 [40048] <pam/#webco> do we have space to put up a staged 3.0 instance for baylor?
1057098223 [40073] <pam/#webco> ok, how bout I respond to alberto and tell him we are going to stage a upgrade next week to make sure all is well before we do it on their production instance
1057098236 [40077] <pam/#webco> adam: okey dokey
1057098243 [40081] <pam/#webco> k
1057098472 [40097] <pam/#webco> ucb is getting an error adding patron class to the find checkouts/reservation search, i am sure related to their custom pclass settings, would that be support action milestone or 3.0.5?
1057098558 [40101] <pam/#webco> ok, i tested on demo and it is just happening to them, lucky ucb
1057098626 [40105] <pam/#webco> ok, bug #5708
1057099201 [40117] <pam/#webco> josh: did you file a bug for that issue dave c reported about not being able to close rypes in the applet with more than two subtypes, i don't see one 
1057099218 [40119] <pam/#webco> but i don't want to duplicate if you got it already

1057100709 [40200] <pam/#webco> josh can you look at the attachment to that bug called Picture1.pdf 2 and confirm there is nothing we can do about it?
1057100786 [40216] <pam/#webco> well they get it all the time they say and it is annoying, its a webco bug tho huh?
1057100822 [40226] <pam/#webco> i've never seen it or had anyone else report it
1057100837 [40230] <pam/#webco> tru

1057158383 [40773] <pam/#webco> josh: yeah, but that is not the email I am talking about
1057158388 [40779] <pam/#webco> ok
1057158409 [40791] <pam/#webco> yeah
1057158712 [40882] <pam/#webco> adam: then move it, you may think it should go somewhere else but I don't think it is 'absurd'
1057158882 [40929] <pam/#webco> adam: that is fine, I understand your point, there doesn't seem to be a need to clasify my behavior, you can just explain your point when I make a mistake and I won't don it again
1057158907 [40933] <pam/#webco> ok, transfer her back, my phone went right to vm for some reason
1057158915 [40937] <pam/#webco> ??

1057159054 [40985] <pam/#webco> hehe
1057159843 [41074] <pam/#webco> craig: i am on with ucla, their testing instance is really slow, is there some reason for that or is it just what we have to live with?
1057160914 [41127] <pam/#webco> thank you, bug difference
1057160916 [41129] <pam/#webco> big
1057162363 [41166] <pam/#webco> josh: penny asking about upgrading from 3.0.1 to 3.0.4, do you see any problems with me scheduling for next week?
1057164049 [41194] <pam/#webco> josh: does upgrading penny's department cause any disruption at the other department at UIUC that is on the same server
1057164287 [41205] <pam/#webco> josh: according to projex uiuc is running 7.2, do I just tell penny to upgrade it?
1057166033 [41303] <pam/#webco> josh: bug #5533 which was supposed to be fixed on 3.0.4 did not fix, ucb is reporting it, do I reopen and milestone for 3.0.5 or move to 3.1
1057166091 [41313] <pam/#webco> having to hit the edit all button on other information during allocation process
1057166105 [41317] <pam/#webco> i thought so too but it sure isn't working again
1057166156 [41329] <pam/#webco> ok, i am going to put on 3.0.5 and wait for adam to slap me ;)
1057169541 [41480] <pam/#webco> josh: do you know of any problems with running webco/netscape 7, ellen's problems seem to have gone away by switching browsers
1057173648 [42123] <pam/#webco> josh: sorry to be a pain but that email from wheaton this morning asking about their server upgarde did not get a response.  I can run the gamut on the speed issues thing but if you could get the other questions I would appreciated it
1057173764 [42127] <pam/#webco> josh: accd just called, one of their dolts ran their entire inventory reports so they are hung, can you stop that process and get them going again?
1057173890 [42143] <pam/#webco> did josh get out of his locks and chains and get away from his desk again?
1057173906 [42151] <pam/#webco> damn
1057173925 [42157] <pam/#webco> will it? they have lots of goodies
1057174637 [42266] <pam/#webco> thanks josh
1057180269 [42505] <pam/#webco> josh: ucb has some time sensitive reporting that is blocked by bug #5708, do you have an est for 3.0.5 or is a patch of a fix a possibility for this?
1057181607 [42563] <pam/#webco> i am on the phone with usc, they claim that they are having trouble with the pickup and return time boxes disappearing from the interface when they tab out of them, any suggestions?  I of course cannot recreate
1057181661 [42565] <pam/#webco> they are also saying that now sometimes items will disappear from the selected resource section but still appear in the timeline scheduler, they say this just started happening about a week or so ago
1057181814 [42575] <pam/#webco> i think so, i asked if someone played with the java settings and he suspects someone now
1057181822 [42577] <pam/#webco> so off of us, woot
1057188454 [42660] <pam/#webco> i'm out
1057596278 [47254] <pam/#webco> cbl: i'll get that one
1057596322 [47256] <pam/#webco> cbl: i am trying to log into rpi's server but after I enter id and password it just hangs, I have training with them tomorrow so I need to make sure I can access and they are up and running, can you see if there is a problem?
1057596342 [47262] <pam/#webco> thx
1057596860 [47308] <pam/#webco> cbl: what can be done?  do we need to call them and get passes again?
1057597142 [47348] <pam/#webco> adam: still not working?  I guess I will try to call network solutions
1057597187 [47356] <pam/#webco> adam: no, I did it on-line so all I have is a printed confirmation page from the browser
1057597194 [47360] <pam/#webco> i will check
1057597845 [47426] <pam/#webco> adam: the order did not complete the first time, I just did it again and it appears to have gone through this time, sorry, it says it should be up within 24 hours
1057597885 [47436] <pam/#webco> adam: yeah, I should get an email from them which I will forward
1057597922 [47446] <pam/#webco> adam: just sent email to you and craigb
1057597958 [47452] <pam/#webco> adam: my trip? oh, no, I am going to vegas for labor day weekend, woot
1057598069 [47468] <pam/#webco> adam: no, i was here on wed and off on thurs for my normal day off and off on friday for the holiday
1057598122 [47474] <pam/#webco> cbl: i can get in now to rpi, I don't know what the dealio was before, thanks for checkin it out

1057678548 [48422] <pam/#webco> josh: there a couple to dos for this week
1057678561 [48428] <pam/#webco> i rescheduled lcc for friday after 3pm
1057678574 [48430] <pam/#webco> we need to install York College, our newest client, running redhat 8
1057678582 [48434] <pam/#webco> i did not open a bug for that yet
1057678587 [48436] <pam/#webco> crap, yes
1057678590 [48438] <pam/#webco> we are bad at this
1057678608 [48444] <pam/#webco> yeah, i even reviewd bugs yesterday and missed it
1057678623 [48446] <pam/#webco> this is not working for upgrades
1057678637 [48450] <pam/#webco> yeah
1057678665 [48452] <pam/#webco> we also need to get going on the staging instance of 3.0.4 for baylor to test sap integration
1057678675 [48454] <pam/#webco> i told them we would at least start that this week
1057678738 [48456] <pam/#webco> eric is out until next thursday, are we still having a meeting today?
1057679129 [48466] <pam/#webco> josh: are you going to send mail to lori @ denver?
1057679182 [48470] <pam/#webco> can you? i am trying to get ready for a four hour phone training session
1057679251 [48480] <pam/#webco> yeah, kinda sucky, better than two days tho!
1057679280 [48488] <pam/#webco> has anyone else been having slow internet problems?
1057679754 [48533] <pam/#webco> josh: can you try to access rpi via your browser and try a couple of different things and see if you have intermintent trouble reaching their server?
1057679779 [48541] <pam/#webco> indeed!
1057680182 [48574] <pam/#webco> oy, jim not home either
1057680379 [48621] <pam/#webco> josh: jim called me back, they are messin with the server so they know they are down
1057684286 [48671] <pam/#onshored> here's is a funny hack: go to google and type in weapons of mass destruction and don't hit the return key but hit the i'm feeling lucky button
1057684365 [48695] <pam/#onshored> sorry man, i'm out of the loop ya know
1057684391 [48705] <pam/#onshored> i prefer the company of humans over my compuTAR
1057694800 [49092] <pam/#webco> training is fun, woot
1057697202 [49186] <pam/#webco> josh: one of the departments at usc has been having some strange issues with the applet, they say that items will disappear from the selected resource section and the pickup/return time boxes will disappear but if they confirm the order it seems to be fine.
1057697236 [49215] <pam/#webco> josh: i have asked them to check their java settings per our documentation and they came back saying they use sun java, do you know if this may cause any problems/
1057697254 [49241] <pam/#webco> windows
1057697262 [49243] <pam/#webco> using IE
1057697307 [49251] <pam/#webco> ok, would they just download the microsoft jvm right?
1057697350 [49257] <pam/#webco> cool
1057697353 [49259] <pam/#webco> thanks
1057697593 [49281] <pam/#webco> josh: i was just guessing that the problems they are seeing is a java thing, i could be wrong, but I can log in and use their system just fine
1057697614 [49285] <pam/#webco> if you have other suggestions I would like to hear em
1057697626 [49289] <pam/#webco> ok

1057704912 [49469] <pam/#webco> i was like, nothin like waiting to the last minute joel
1057704923 [49473] <pam/#webco> yes, I explained that to a very disappointed joel
1057704945 [49479] <pam/#webco> i even told him that with our workload this week we probably couldn't even stage them until next week
1057704948 [49486] <pam/#webco> smack
1057704995 [49500] <pam/#webco> yeah baby
1057705030 [49513] <pam/#webco> joel will email request and follow proper support channels, he left a msg for eric on his cell phone this afternoon requeting the upgrade and couldn't understand why that wasn't going to work
1057705061 [49521] <pam/#webco> i told him eric, the ceo, does not do software upgrades
1057705075 [49525] <pam/#webco> he could if he waited until tomorrow
1057706006 [49541] <pam/#webco> kreig: i am having some trouble with internet connection, intermittent slowness and browser hanging, josh had said that the covad went down over the weekend, could that have anything to do with it?
1057706188 [49545] <pam/#webco> how do I find out? i have been having trouble since yesterday and it is hard to get any help beyond the shoulder shrug and this is not my forte
1057766316 [50011] <pam/#onshored> good mornin
1057766348 [50013] <pam/#onshored> thank you lee, the trouble is really intermittent tho, like minute to minute it seems
1057766420 [50023] <pam/#onshored> ok, ill let you know if i am still having trouble today.  did you notice it too?
1057769856 [50207] <pam/#webco> cbl: did you see albertos comment about usage fees not makin it into the staged instance for baylor but they are somehow still calculating?
1057770454 [50278] <pam/#webco> kari is gone
1057773872 [50444] <pam/#webco> ayres called covad and filed a trouble ticke today, god love him
1057781354 [50960] <pam/#webco> josh: i just filed a bug for York College install which I am hoping we can do tomorrow or friday but they are our first attempt at redhat 8 so I don't know if that will delay it, what do you think?
1057781419 [50975] <pam/#webco> oh yeah, ok, can you just let me know where it stands b/f you leave on thursday since I am out then?
1057781457 [50982] <pam/#webco> yeah, its in the bug
1057781474 [50988] <pam/#webco> hm
1057781490 [50990] <pam/#webco> doh
1057781503 [50994] <pam/#webco> thanks
1057781683 [51014] <pam/#webco> sorry, wasn't thinkin
1057781796 [51020] <pam/#webco> phew
1057781855 [51022] <pam/#webco> uh, where is ithaca instance at? did we just take them down
1057781905 [51034] <pam/#webco> yeah we are but I wasn't thining about the fact that we would be taking them down 
1057781912 [51036] <pam/#webco> ellen is fine with it, she is nice
1057781973 [51041] <pam/#webco> no biggie, I just should have called her first, she is not full on in production so she doesn't really care
1057782057 [51047] <pam/#webco> can we get lee to stop the test with covad, I guess eric is trying to to a demo, doh
1057782150 [51057] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1057782265 [51063] <pam/#webco> are they saying they can't help us because we aren't down entirely?
1057782475 [51086] <pam/#webco> yeah, lee talked to me about that, maybe we can get past this level of support that is telling lee we have to take everything off line when it seems like both lee and craigb think that is unnec.
1057782552 [51102] <pam/#webco> yeah, true, but they have to understand that if they are giving us business dsl that we can't just take it down during our operating hours
1057782597 [51108] <pam/#webco> yeah, i wasn't thinking about the full impact of taking it down now, such as eric doing demo, ithaca is now down
1057782620 [51112] <pam/#webco> so we need it back up if possible
1057784860 [51182] <pam/#webco> kreig: you should call, they offer special rates
1057784879 [51186] <pam/#webco> krieg: i am very sorry, please let me know if you need anything

1057791892 [51410] <pam/#webco> no, no answer yet, just wanted to make sure it got addressed by either you or more likely cbl tomorrow since he is the one who set up the instance
1057791911 [51418] <pam/#webco> so just a friendly reminder from the annoying support staff above you
1057791926 [51424] <pam/#webco> thanks

1058371959 [57734] <pam/#webco> good morning
1058380391 [58047] <pam/#webco> adam: we decided you were going to contact joel at usc, right?
1058381069 [58126] <pam/#webco> josh: we host their server, can they really do it themselves?
1058382684 [58278] <pam/#webco> josh: i didn't get ahold of either the main contact or the admin contact at york so they will probably call you back this afternoon for the pwords since I am leaving shortly
1058383185 [58337] <pam/#webco> ok, im getting ready to take off
1058383211 [58349] <pam/#webco> josh: can you follow up with the uri issues about new server/os upgrade and webcheck upgrade that are going back and forth?
1058383222 [58353] <pam/#webco> thank you
1058383232 [58357] <pam/#webco> i think all my bases are covered then
1058383254 [58363] <pam/#webco> can we? that's cool, run that by eric tomorrow when he gets back
1058383268 [58367] <pam/#webco> msu will be sending import files by end of day on Friday
1058383313 [58383] <pam/#webco> quinnipiac should be contacting us with serer access info so we can schedule their install for next week sometime
1058384931 [58451] <pam/#webco> josh: i fixed the admin problem at ufl, don loftus had gone in and changed our Administrator to his user id and password instead of setting himself up, oy, they are back in business
1058803784 [63801] <pam/#webco> does dagfin have a phone ext?
1058803817 [63805] <pam/#webco> refusenik: yes, there is supposed to be an est. total on the contents tab of any reservation or current checkout
1058803824 [63807] <pam/#webco> I have a phone call for dag, is he around?
1058803884 [63813] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you can check it out by looking at any 2.0.12 version and some of the allocations do seem to have est. fees on the ucb but it is not consistent
1058804522 [63852] <pam/#webco> dag: laura called for you
1058809835 [64226] <pam/#webco> my emails to support don't seem to be going through today
1058809968 [64228] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i responded to frank and asked him to change the order of the file but my support email does not seem to be getting delivered
1058810038 [64234] <pam/#webco> adam: thanks, I don't seem to be having any other email trouble
1058810135 [64238] <pam/#webco> weird, several emails did not show up and I just sent a test to support and nothing
1058812688 [64303] <pam/#webco> refusenik: msu has a lot of information that they need in the description field of the resource detail screen, this is not currently a part of our resource import, is it a lot of work to do a mapping to add this filed with their resource import?
1058812825 [64307] <pam/#webco> no, I still didn't get the ones I sent this morning, ill do another test one
1058813030 [64321] <pam/#webco> refusenik: it is resource, what do you mean by associate?  it is a field currently availalbe on the resource detail screen but not part of our import
1058813039 [64323] <pam/#webco> adam: i didn't get the test I just sent, did you?
1058813176 [64335] <pam/#webco> refusenik: yeah, its in the import in another coloumn so it is already associated with the resource they want it to be, just need to tell them where in the order on the template it should be, assuming we can do it
1058813862 [64356] <pam/#webco> eric just sent a test email to support and it did not show up either, adam had to run, is there anyone else who can offer some help?
1058813885 [64360] <pam/#webco> thanks lee
1058820474 [64464] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did uwm only send email to you or call or something?
1058820613 [64468] <pam/#webco> refusenik: any way the answer to that question is not, we can't do another import unless they pay us to do another, silly customers, I would point them towards dan if you are in touch with them
1058821049 [64500] <pam/#webco> hm, well I certainly don't remember how many times but dan da man says we may not charge them, dan asks to forward email and dan will let them know that we are giving them something we wouldn't normally do.  The three stike rule is more for the initial process of back and forth, I wouldn't say it is a you get three imports no matter how long it has been since we got sign off, sigh off I would say is key, only my opinion tho
1058821280 [64509] <pam/#webco> refusenik: who was the call from? jon pollak?
1058821386 [64513] <pam/#webco> refusenik: thanks, did you start the msu import yet?  the description field is on the end, eric gave to ok to go ahead and add the description to the import, I tried to ping adam and make sure it was ok with him but he has gone offline
1058821536 [64523] <pam/#webco> refusenik: yeah, std except that he added the description to the end, so not really standard, do you think you could do the work to add the description?  also, maybe it would be better to remove the description field and run the import just to see if there are any other problems that we need to shoot back to frank, up to you, I don't know how long it takes to run a normal import
1058821710 [64530] <pam/#webco> refusenik: no, that is rpi, although I can't guarentee that they don't have it somewhere too, they have over 8k in resources so it is hard to tel just by veiwing
1058821767 [64532] <pam/#webco> if they have it, it may be something simple to fix like it was the last time it cropped up, where it was really only one place or two places that had the same and we could adjust easily
1058821860 [64536] <pam/#webco> i don't mean fix in the script, i mean we did a simple fix to their naming structure in the import and then fixed it back after the import
1058821925 [64547] <pam/#webco> hm, well, either way I won't know until you run the import if they have the same problem
1058821943 [64552] <pam/#webco> i know what the process is supposed to be, we are trying to get the job done with an existing bug
1058821965 [64557] <pam/#webco> you don't need to lecture me about what is expensive for us
1058822281 [64561] <pam/#webco> i have to go up there to train by next week so I am just trying to get the import done, adding the description field is not included in the cost, that would be something we decide to do for them outside of that, other than that we charge for 12 hours of labor for every import so I don't think we blow that a lot
1058823489 [64628] <pam/#webco> refusenik: why are we reloading the patron file for uwm too?
1058823687 [64632] <pam/#webco> well if 3 developers agree, how can you argue with that kind of marketing?
1058823791 [64646] <pam/#webco> ahh, ok
1058826569 [64684] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you have a ref resource id or anything that I can search their data by?
1058826819 [64690] <pam/#webco> oh, I found them, there seem to be several
1058827344 [64694] <pam/#webco> i will email list to frank and get him to correct, there also appear to be several w/o resource ids
1058827412 [64700] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i have usc on the phone with problems with their servers and speed, way over my head, will you take?  they usually deal with kreig
1058831948 [64728] <pam/#webco> hi joshy
1058832007 [64742] <pam/#webco> oooo, dmv, so nice, did you have to take the test?
1058832026 [64748] <pam/#webco> which office did you go to?
1058832039 [64756] <pam/#webco> wow, i went that and it was a 15min wait
1058832046 [64758] <pam/#webco> unlucky you
1058832056 [64762] <pam/#webco> oof
1058832068 [64774] <pam/#webco> well i'm going home now, see ya tomorrow
1058888810 [65075] <pam/#webco> good morning
1058889520 [65088] <pam/#webco> kelly stack just called to find out what the status is of a 3.0.4 bug that Chris reported last night at 5:20pm
1058889530 [65090] <pam/#webco> giggles
1058891237 [65117] <pam/#webco> josh: there is an email from Micheal at Wheaton sent yesterday called problems again that I need you to take a look at pls
1058891291 [65125] <pam/#webco> something about system not taking certain events but if they reboot the server it continues as normal
1058892864 [65233] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you around?
1058893647 [65255] <pam/#webco> refusenik: msu sent in corrected file, don't know if you saws it or not
1058893722 [65262] <pam/#webco> thx
1058894064 [65264] <pam/#webco> josh: did anyone from quinnipiac contact you last week for access to their server to install?
1058895141 [65311] <pam/#webco> adam: i am on the sfsu call, I will hook up with Laurie and then conference you in, I am in tomorrow, its next week that I am out most of the week at msu
1058895570 [65323] <pam/#webco> adam: yep
1058896564 [65347] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what's up with 5842?
1058897122 [65383] <pam/#webco> refusenik: sure, is the msu one running?  I would like that to go before uwm if they can't be running at the same time, just more time pressure on the msu imports for me
1058897183 [65385] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i can open both the uwm files in xls, do you want me to attach new files to the bug or do something else with them?
1058897208 [65400] <pam/#webco> josh: did quinnipiac contact us last week with access to their server for install?
1058897230 [65409] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, you don't need the patron one?
1058897490 [65431] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, attached
1058900792 [65475] <pam/#webco> hey, i just got a mid-air collisionon bugzilla, cool
1058900818 [65480] <pam/#webco> yep, we tried to file update at the same time
1058900841 [65484] <pam/#webco> nope, cause I didn't write one :)
1058900913 [65494] <pam/#webco> refusenik: no, I didn't see it, did you send to support?
1058900932 [65498] <pam/#webco> oh
1058901029 [65505] <pam/#webco> refusenik: does it just stop when it hits one? or is that the only remaining offender?
1058901449 [65529] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, he told me that the resources that contained themseleves was an error by a staff member and that there should be no containing resource on those records so if there are a lot left i will shoot it back to him, if just a few I will just fix and we can run it
1058901467 [65533] <pam/#webco> if just a few fail we can just let him know which ones and then they can be entered by hand maybe
1058904485 [65827] <pam/#webco> josh: can you check to see if the wonderful webco users at ucb changed our admin pword, i can't get in their system
1058905259 [65936] <pam/#webco> josh: i tried both lower case and upper for ucb, which should it be?
1058906839 [66120] <pam/#webco> refusenik: whats up with the msu import, my friend frank wants to know
1058915786 [67135] <pam/#webco> me out

1059145487 [73009] <pam/#webco> hi
1059145520 [73013] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i have not opened my email yet so forgive me if I should know this but did you get a chance to run the patron import for msu yesterday?  I know there are still some errors with their resources
1059145764 [73032] <pam/#webco> refusenik: great, thanks
1059145771 [73034] <pam/#webco> no problems I assume
1059146549 [73058] <pam/#webco> adam: i did not get the msu resource import email, am I on the new data list?
1059146566 [73064] <pam/#webco> hehe
1059147547 [73153] <pam/#webco> ok, fixed me mail
1059151435 [73497] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i had some email problems and I did not get the email that you sent to frank at msu listing the new errors from the resource import run yesterday, can you forward to me again pls?
1059155077 [73569] <pam/#webco> doh, application allowing duplicate resource ids
1059155357 [73577] <pam/#webco> wouldn't it be great if I knew what that meant! ;)
1059155366 [73580] <pam/#webco> refusenik: still the same amount of errors?
1059155548 [73589] <pam/#webco> that is soooo much better, we were over 500 before - yay, can you send me a new list of the errors and i will do some hunting to see if they are true error, my guess it that they are
1059167028 [74275] <pam/#webco> josh: you want me to get that usc email you forwarded or did you get it?
1059167330 [74341] <pam/#webco> josh: no worries, i resonded to them, the didn't tell us the resource type name so I can't check the policy settings until they do
1059168333 [74391] <pam/#webco> is there some way to support the mouse wheel for navigating webco, silly customers want everything
1059168368 [74401] <pam/#webco> sweet
1059168973 [74449] <pam/#webco> josh: i filed accd error as support action, I don't think he can't make changes to a reservation even tho that is what he said
1059171450 [74736] <pam/#webco> gotta go, see yall on monday
1059408986 [75540] <pam/#webco> howdy
1059409573 [75548] <pam/#webco> Richard sent me an email on Friday eve about continued slowness after 3.0 upgrade at usc, I am forwarding to support
1059411660 [75611] <pam/#webco> is the utexas server migration happening today?
1059411792 [75615] <pam/#webco> thanks
1059412837 [75633] <pam/#webco> just a heads up, I am in a training session that will last about 4 hours
1059417827 [75871] <pam/#webco> do we have an OS 9 cd somewhere?
1059417865 [75879] <pam/#webco> i got my new computer :)))))))))))
1059417900 [75889] <pam/#webco> according to gordon it can be installed but did not come with
1059417913 [75895] <pam/#webco> i have not looked myself yet
1059417946 [75903] <pam/#webco> oh, gordon may not know that but it would be cool
1059420064 [76017] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am on with rpi training and there is an error on the left frame of resources and reservations, can you take a quick look and see if you can tell what is causing it?  if not I can get around it but it is getting in the way 
1059420071 [76020] <pam/#webco> #<WCO::WEBCHECKOUT {492BBE9D}>: An error occurred during processing:
1059420072 [76022] <pam/#webco> Argument X is not a NUMBER: :INVALID.
1059420082 [76026] <pam/#webco> ok
1059420289 [76040] <pam/#webco> crap there is an error on the reservation tab and I can't even see the applet
1059420290 [76042] <pam/#webco> #<WCO::WEBCHECKOUT {492BBE9D}>: An error occurred during processing:
1059420290 [76044] <pam/#webco> Argument NUMBER is not a REAL: :INVALID.
1059420337 [76052] <pam/#webco> huh>
1059420340 [76054] <pam/#webco> ?
1059420391 [76060] <pam/#webco> now i log in and it says
1059420392 [76062] <pam/#webco> mod_webapp(warp) error
1059420394 [76064] <pam/#webco> No packets received waiting response 
1059420448 [76076] <pam/#webco> ok, now just haning in browser
1059420463 [76080] <pam/#webco> k
1059420473 [76084] <pam/#webco> ok
1059420549 [76090] <pam/#webco> we were training on schedules so it may have happened there
1059420566 [76096] <pam/#webco> oh, we also set some policy on check out center level
1059420575 [76098] <pam/#webco> can we just set back to defaults?
1059421051 [76135] <pam/#webco> would it help if I go back in and set the policy?  what we did is remove policy from some that they did not what to set, like renewal grace period.  You used to be able to just remove the number and then the polcy would not effect anything
1059421082 [76145] <pam/#webco> yeah, I know not now
1059421223 [76164] <pam/#webco> ok, i rescheduled the rest of training for tomorrow at 1130am
1059421237 [76166] <pam/#webco> instead of leaving them sitting around
1059421249 [76172] <pam/#webco> not your fault
1059421262 [76174] <pam/#webco> just another day in the life of webcheckout :)
1059421280 [76176] <pam/#webco> i was tired of training them any way ;)
1059421494 [76201] <pam/#webco> we do need a way in the system that allows people to turn off certain policies, I thought this was accomplished by removing the time altogether from the polciy setting but that is what is now causing this problem
1059421501 [76203] <pam/#webco> refusenik: reset is fine
1059421507 [76207] <pam/#webco> they are not in production
1059421676 [76222] <pam/#webco> refusenik: no problem, we can address the bug behind the issue later, I will file
1059422098 [76229] <pam/#webco> hm, they have a bunch of operators that they set up, will we lose all that?
1059422119 [76231] <pam/#webco> what if you let me back in to the system to see if I can change the bad data through the interface?
1059422124 [76233] <pam/#webco> will that work?
1059422159 [76237] <pam/#webco> ok
1059422203 [76241] <pam/#webco> how long until I can get back in?
1059424191 [76373] <pam/#webco> refusenik: sorry, I got distracted, but it looks like resetting the policies fixed the error problems
1059424963 [76384] <pam/#webco> i think we need an extra support person just to answer usc emails now
1059425102 [76386] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you answer jason's email about printer and I can get the one about bugzilla and customizable agreement forms
1059425148 [76390] <pam/#webco> thx
1059427259 [76422] <pam/#webco> kreig: ok, thanks
1059432132 [76477] <pam/#webco> longs to go home and play with new computer
1059432154 [76487] <pam/#webco> you don't wanna know
1059432170 [76490] <pam/#webco> 6, 7, 8....:)
1059432189 [76494] <pam/#webco> but i have lots to do to get ready to leave for msu tomorrow night so i may go at 6
1059432201 [76498] <pam/#webco> will do
1059432240 [76506] <pam/#webco> see you tomorrow josh
1059433054 [76550] <pam/#webco> me go now, see you all tomorrow
1059489438 [77282] <pam/#webco> good morning
1059489813 [77288] <pam/#webco> refusenik: around?
1059489963 [77295] <pam/#webco> hey there, have you started the msu import yet?
1059490030 [77301] <pam/#webco> what is on your plate today, I have to leave this afternoon to go to msu and want to see how that file loads
1059490211 [77313] <pam/#webco> josh: since cbl is busy with the usc thing do you think you can load the latest msu file for me?
1059490640 [77335] <pam/#webco> can I get a confirmation of the bug I got yesterday during training with rpi...If you want to not use a policy such as Pickup Grace Period or Renewal Grace Period the proper behavior is to remove any data from that field, yes?  This caused major problems yesterday but I could swear that is how I have done it in the past
1059490724 [77341] <pam/#webco> no, the defaults are set to 30 min
1059490736 [77343] <pam/#webco> what is you don't want any grace period at all?
1059490764 [77349] <pam/#webco> no, 0 minutes means a reservation will cancel as soon as it hits pickup time, right?
1059490810 [77355] <pam/#webco> no, I mean a reservation doesn not cancel ever  or you can renew whenever without restriction
1059490824 [77357] <pam/#webco> is that 0?
1059490836 [77363] <pam/#webco> right, sorrry to confuse
1059490969 [77372] <pam/#webco> I have always just removed any data from the policy field and I thought that worked until yesterday
1059490996 [77374] <pam/#webco> so maybe I was always wrong or maybe this is all just a new bug
1059491179 [77383] <pam/#webco> it I set that policy to 999 days I bet I will hose the find checkout/reservation search function on the pick up page since it alwasy buffers by the pick up grace period
1059491253 [77385] <pam/#webco> but 7 days or something like that should work too I would think
1059492352 [77400] <pam/#webco> thanks, any errors?>
1059494313 [77442] <pam/#webco> i am traing rpi so I can't make meeting unless we do it in an hour
1059497156 [77506] <pam/#webco> ok, done with training
1059499439 [77709] <pam/#webco> josh: did you see email from rik at accd about roots and parents?
1059499552 [77721] <pam/#webco> josh: roots and parents
1059499565 [77727] <pam/#webco> ukansas is down
1059499580 [77729] <pam/#webco> they just sent me email
1059499766 [77750] <pam/#webco> josh can you check ukansas first, they are down
1059499773 [77756] <pam/#webco> thx
1059500352 [77832] <pam/#webco> josh: i filed ubc second dept install bug, put tomorrows date on it if you can get to it
1059500357 [77836] <pam/#webco> josh: yeah, they are on 3.0.2 i think
1059506137 [78470] <pam/#webco> josh: any idea on that accd issue?
1059510532 [78797] <pam/#webco> ok, im heading out, don't miss me
1060110562 [84085] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you have a couple of min to come look at the msu dealio up here?
1060116728 [84573] <pam/#webco> josh: if uiuc is running 3.0.1 and redhat 7.2 do we need them to upgrade past that to get 3.0.4.1?
1060116999 [84585] <pam/#webco> i need better drugs
1060124428 [84934] <pam/#webco> refusenik: some of the rtypes are still not listing in the applet, in Classroom Media Support Services checkout Base -- Audio -- Slide Lens - 4-8 zoom, listing on resource types form page but not in applet
1060124445 [84936] <pam/#webco> there are lots but that is just an example
1060124531 [84945] <pam/#webco> refusenik: true, not an import bug, just another bug, bug, bug, bug
1060124573 [84951] <pam/#webco> yeah, don't want to run short, then what would we do with all our time
1060124605 [84953] <pam/#webco> josh: did you do any special magic to fix the rtype indexing issues that came up for accd?  seems to be the same issue I would think for msu
1060124811 [84969] <pam/#webco> ok
1060125064 [84977] <pam/#webco> refusenik: no love
1060125079 [84979] <pam/#webco> still not listing in crapplet
1060125469 [84991] <pam/#webco> k
1060125560 [84993] <pam/#webco> nope, still no workie, time for a beer
1060125646 [84997] <pam/#webco> uh, no, nice try tho
1060125667 [85001] <pam/#webco> is that a serious question?
1060125700 [85005] <pam/#webco> they don't barcode, they have to find all resources for a reservation through the applet, it they ain't all there it doensn't get them very far
1060125748 [85009] <pam/#webco> will the fun never end
1060125777 [85013] <pam/#webco> you mean friday, i'm out on thrusday, maybe josh can take a stab tomorrow
1060125815 [85017] <pam/#webco> well i'm done caring for the day, see you all tomorrow
1060125858 [85021] <pam/#webco> that is true, I am happy with our progress, its just msu that won't be :)
1060125879 [85023] <pam/#webco> and they will just have to wait like good little webcheckout customers
1060188722 [85378] <pam/#webco> howdy
1060188930 [85396] <pam/#webco> josh: can you take a stab at re-indexing the msu site to get the rtypes fixed?
1060188963 [85406] <pam/#webco> yeah but it never worked, you managed to get it to work for others
1060188974 [85412] <pam/#webco> i don't know, maybe it is no different
1060188984 [85417] <pam/#webco> ok
1060188987 [85421] <pam/#webco> thanks
1060189062 [85429] <pam/#webco> no, do your other stuff first, I can keep them calm, but they do really want it
1060189071 [85432] <pam/#webco> but who doesn't, right?
1060190171 [85549] <pam/#webco> josh: i opened bug for final rpi resource import sent to support last night.  I put thursday or friday as the date, is that ok?
1060200596 [85861] <pam/#webco> not a bug?  what could it be....I think you are talkin crazy
1060200956 [85885] <pam/#webco> josh: wow, crap, sorry, I didn't even think to check that, I assumed it was the indexing issue
1060200986 [85897] <pam/#webco> imagine me assuming it was a bug, silly me
1060208816 [86287] <pam/#webco> i'm going to go get drunk now, see you on friday
1060208871 [86303] <pam/#webco> don't know, didn't here back from them
1060208877 [86306] <pam/#webco> one more time just for kicks
1060208906 [86310] <pam/#webco> frank sent an email earlier saying he thought some of the serial numbers were incorrect but I asked him for examples and he didn't respond
1060208911 [86315] <pam/#webco> so we will see
1060208924 [86317] <pam/#webco> they weren't retarded, I was
1060208942 [86326] <pam/#webco> trust me'
1060208980 [86332] <pam/#webco> ok, blame them, I can live with that just fine
1060209018 [86338] <pam/#webco> ok, I'll be on a little tomorrow but mostly out, see you on friday
1060275116 [86843] <pam/#onshored> hmm, i don't know how to impersonate pam
1060359529 [88663] <pam/#webco> josh: did any one from quinnipiac contact you with access to their server for install?
1060359547 [88669] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you?
1060359658 [88687] <pam/#webco> josh: I have pete from quinnipiac on the phone with pword and what not, can I trasfer?
1060359672 [88693] <pam/#webco> you can send him back to me after you get what you need
1060367211 [89012] <pam/#webco> refusenik: how hard is that for them to do?  They need to go to debian 3?  Can I forward you the contact info for the sysadmin over there and you can tell him what they need to do?
1060367252 [89016] <pam/#webco> refusenik: maybe, scott wilson
1060367312 [89022] <pam/#webco> thanks
1060367460 [89024] <pam/#webco> i cry
1060367474 [89027] <pam/#webco> how long of a process do you think it is?
1060367601 [89031] <pam/#webco> and there is no way we can put them on 3.0 and then do the upgrade to the os?
1060367627 [89037] <pam/#webco> crap, did you get a hold of him
1060367675 [89042] <pam/#webco> ok, we'll have to see how it goes, maybe we load a copy of their data onto one of our servers to do the training on is the only thing I can think of if he can't do the upgrade in time
1060367716 [89046] <pam/#webco> actually it would be better to do that anyway instead of training on a production instance
1060367721 [89048] <pam/#webco> do you think that is possible>?
1060368187 [89058] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what do you think about setting up a staged instance for uchicago training?
1060368232 [89062] <pam/#webco> refusenik: then I don't have to worry about messing up their production data while training and we can back off this "have to be upgraded by tuesday' problem I created
1060368314 [89068] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i think we would need to check with craigB or maybe lee to see where/if there is space
1060368355 [89072] <pam/#webco> refusenik: yeah I know but I could potentially cause some problems training on their production instance, I wasn't really thinking about that before and I think that is a big issue
1060368657 [89085] <pam/#webco> adam: i can create a fake user but not fake resources
1060368675 [89087] <pam/#webco> adam: i guess I could but that would defeat the purpose of training on their stuff
1060368741 [89091] <pam/#webco> refusenik: aren't we blocked from rpi sever currently or did we get back in?
1060368894 [89106] <pam/#webco> adam: it could affect their resource usage data and if we don't catch any reservations/checkouts created during training to remove it could cause availablity issues for them, if that is above and beyond that is your call to make
1060368932 [89108] <pam/#webco> i am fine doing it either way but just trying to not cause unnec. problems
1060369134 [89116] <pam/#webco> ok
1060369207 [89128] <pam/#webco> ok, will do
1060369413 [89140] <pam/#webco> can I get 2nd level support to answer Mary Jane Palm email from friday w/header "URI needs updated server sw list to prep for WCO 3.0.4" pls?
1060371842 [89160] <pam/#webco> refusenik: looks like scott at uofc may be able to get it together for the upgrade quickly
1060372186 [89166] <pam/#webco> josh: oy, there does seem to be anothe small bug in the applet on msu, there are a few rtypes that are showing up in the drill down but all of their resrouced are contained by other pieces.  I am going to file as support action bug
1060372241 [89174] <pam/#webco> well, on webcheckout.imc.msu.edu look at Classroom Support Services BCC (SC) -- Cart in the applet
1060372246 [89176] <pam/#webco> no, not a fire issue
1060372255 [89182] <pam/#webco> sure thing
1060373119 [89225] <pam/#webco> ayres: i tested the accd customs that you completed and they look good and to spec
1060373268 [89246] <pam/#webco> the only part of phase one custom not complete is adding academic level to the patron integration from accd and we don't need to do that until we are ready to full on test them with a staged instance of 3.1, too early for that in my op
1060373274 [89250] <pam/#webco> dan i just did it and got no error
1060373280 [89252] <pam/#webco> weird
1060373285 [89254] <pam/#webco> what workflow are you following?
1060373442 [89282] <pam/#webco> adam: where is accd testing instance? I didn't know we had one for them
1060373483 [89295] <pam/#webco> dan is smokin crack today, there is no error in the academic level edit
1060373499 [89305] <pam/#webco> sure dan
1060376099 [89378] <pam/#webco> what component do I use to file bug to get beta enabled with all features?
1060376287 [89387] <pam/#webco> did I say josh??
1060376302 [89391] <pam/#webco> :)
1060376331 [89395] <pam/#webco> i like it that way but in this case I will let some one else help me
1060376338 [89397] <pam/#webco> just this one time tho
1060376369 [89407] <pam/#webco> hehe
1060376837 [89421] <pam/#webco> are these just really heavy on the resources?
1060376844 [89423] <pam/#webco> or is it something else causing
1060376846 [89425] <pam/#webco> slow
1060376849 [89427] <pam/#webco> ness
1060376894 [89429] <pam/#webco> ok
1060377088 [89443] <pam/#webco> ick
1060379082 [89505] <pam/#webco> dan left already
1060379245 [89509] <pam/#webco> reusenik: did it apeear that scott at uofc got their box where it needed to be or will we have to wait til monday for upgrade?
1060379344 [89522] <pam/#webco> do they need to?  I have stupid 3.0 training with them on tuesday, dan set that up so they need to be running it first
1060379362 [89529] <pam/#webco> that is the slow rtypes one, yah?
1060379655 [89606] <pam/#webco> uofc had a total of 4 completed checkout last week I don't think they will have much trouble
1060379668 [89610] <pam/#webco> power user
1060379701 [89620] <pam/#webco> I know but if they only do four checkouts in a weeks time they won't really feel any effect I would think
1060379714 [89627] <pam/#webco> just a guess, what do I know
1060379725 [89632] <pam/#webco> they will bitch any way I am sure
1060379744 [89638] <pam/#webco> i so dont want to do thi
1060379747 [89640] <pam/#webco> this session
1060379761 [89646] <pam/#webco> ok, that would be much better
1060385869 [89653] <pam/#webco> josh: are you still around?
1060702597 [92622] <pam/#webco> josh: i think we have a growing problem at uiuc, it looks like fees are not assessing properly for them, I am going to file a p1 crit on the support action for this
1060702625 [92632] <pam/#webco> josh: yeah, I can't recreate on demo either so I don't know if it is unique to them or what
1060704067 [92761] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you get anywhere with the accd take resource offline problem they were having yesterday?  Do you need me to go in and qualify and file bug or did you get it?
1060704398 [92797] <pam/#webco> josh: uiuc bug #5966
1060704442 [92807] <pam/#webco> josh: coolio, thx
1060708821 [92944] <pam/#webco> josh or refusenik: is someone checking on denver admin pword being reset per Lori email?
1060709170 [92978] <pam/#webco> oic
1060709179 [92980] <pam/#webco> thx
1060709762 [92993] <pam/#webco> josh: where are we on installing our friends at quinnipiac?

1060803827 [95156] <pam/#webco> thx
1060805415 [95274] <pam/#webco> redhat reissuing order for linux 9, we should get on friday
1060805472 [95278] <pam/#webco> so we basically have two orders for the cds out there in ups land, we need to refuse one of them so if one shows up, please try to remember to refuse the second one, if I am not around
1060806188 [95307] <pam/#webco> it was fine, I had to take a hard line with them so they didn't launch into anothe session of the things we don't like about webcheckout
1060806804 [95381] <pam/#webco> josh: email from udenver just came in about printing, I am sure their set up for printing in 2.0 got wacked by the upgrade, can you handle with lori?
1060806830 [95396] <pam/#webco> josh: don't you have time to do ten more things at once?
1060812802 [96034] <pam/#webco> sorry, i didn't file a bug, I think she just may need some help with the new print queue, host thing, not sure really
1060812879 [96048] <pam/#webco> ok, i will keep that in mind for future
1060814492 [96088] <pam/#webco> josh: forwaded denver email to support

1060966151 [98011] <pam/#webco> josh: what about the fee data that it looked like they wanted?
1060967992 [98041] <pam/#webco> josh: did you schedule quinnipiac training?
1060968003 [98043] <pam/#webco> I don't think I have a date yet
1060968010 [98047] <pam/#webco> did they mention it?
1060968014 [98051] <pam/#webco> i hope I didn't flake it 
1060968031 [98053] <pam/#webco> oh, maybe he should check in with the trainer before setting that up :)
1060968995 [98080] <pam/#webco> has anyone seen the redhat cds yet?
1060969218 [98092] <pam/#webco> please remember to refuse the other shipment if it shows up
1060969558 [98098] <pam/#webco> josh: that was my understanding of those and eric agrees
1060970801 [98142] <pam/#webco> LSU Dental did not renew their support contract
1060970829 [98156] <pam/#webco> no more davenport, he left a while ago
1060970852 [98160] <pam/#webco> josh: can you mark projex to reflect that they don't get any support from us unless they pay us
1060970967 [98168] <pam/#webco> i don't think they are using the software anymore but I could be wrong
1060982193 [98579] <pam/#webco> josh: that is weird, they set departments in order to add an account code usually, there should be lots with paying departments
1060982370 [98583] <pam/#webco> hm, yeah probably
1061225046 [99364] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I have utah on the phone, they are slow and he wants to trouble shoot it, can you assist him or should I advise him to send email?
1061225910 [99412] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you finish the qunnipiac install since joshy is away today?  I am suppose to train those mooks tomorrow
1061225953 [99414] <pam/#webco> refusenik: if not I can try to reschedule training since we couldn't finish install due to power outage
1061230613 [99528] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I need to call pete at quinnipiac to let him know if we are going to get the install done today, when you know please advise me, thx
1061230838 [99543] <pam/#webco> refusenik: sorry, I thought you said you would look at it and let me know
1061230867 [99552] <pam/#webco> refusenik: rpi is on the phone, having trouble bringing machine back up after power outage, can you take the call?
1061230891 [99556] <pam/#webco> thank you

1061240610 [99881] <pam/#webco> love that guy
1061240699 [99887] <pam/#webco> thanks
1061240783 [99893] <pam/#webco> refusenik: looks like uchicago is having trouble seeing root types in applet, needs to be reindexed, can you get that?
1061240815 [99895] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I will investigate udenver if I can get you to get me into their instance
1061242289 [99983] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i don't know, Josh would always set something up for me to veiw udevenr since I can't get to them directly, if you don't know what I am talking about I can wait til josh comes in tomorrow

1061409736 [1732] <pam/#webco> josh: denver is getting the following error, have you seen this pop up b/f? they are getting it when tryng to strike a charge on an invoice #<WCO::WEBCHECKOUT {49ECA225}>: An error occurred during processing:

1061409819 [1765] <pam/#webco> the one listed in the email was 1410
1061410137 [1776] <pam/#webco> josh: no phone, just trying to resolve issue that started a couple days ago, sent email to try and get more info from lori
1061410153 [1780] <pam/#webco> she keeps sending one word responses to me which is so unhelpful
1061410220 [1786] <pam/#webco> should it create a printout?  I thought invoices only printed on demand
1061410239 [1794] <pam/#webco> oh
1061410250 [1798] <pam/#webco> yeah
1061410261 [1802] <pam/#webco> yep
1061410716 [1819] <pam/#webco> is adam around?
1061412723 [1822] <pam/#webco> josh: york can not restart their server after power loss, can you help or should I file bug
1061412773 [1827] <pam/#webco> sure thing
1061412891 [1840] <pam/#webco> no, they can wait until you are done with what you are on
1061412981 [1853] <pam/#webco> bug #6050
1061413079 [1869] <pam/#webco> hey adam
1061413099 [1875] <pam/#webco> adam: sju emailed in that their integration is not running again, what should be the support procedure for this?
1061413151 [1879] <pam/#webco> i reveiwed bug 5539 but it is not clear to me how to handle from that
1061413230 [1889] <pam/#webco> adam: all andy said was Hi all we've got problems again. Intergration stopped happing on August 1st and hasent resumed. That is all the info I'm getting from Webcheckout I hope it's helpful.
1061413241 [1891] <pam/#webco> i should check their logs for possible error?
1061413878 [1935] <pam/#webco> adam: ok, thanks, will kick back to sju
1061414422 [1979] <pam/#webco> adam/kreig: my only complaints about leaving other information and patron info editable outside of the edit reservation scope is that (1) any changes made to these pages are not logged in activity and that an operator w/o the capability to edit reservations can make change w/o pin check
1061414690 [1988] <pam/#webco> yeah, i just forgot to put in the (2) for my second point, doh
1061414711 [1990] <pam/#webco> you want sep bugs then?
1061414722 [1994] <pam/#webco> k
1061416109 [2060] <pam/#webco> josh: usage fees at uiuc still wacked out, i am reopening bug with more info
1061416555 [2087] <pam/#webco> kreig: i opened new bug for operator being able to edit reservation w/o pin check
1061418884 [2225] <pam/#webco> do you guys think it is a bug that you can choose a resource to be contained that is already contained in a different resource?  the system just moves it off of original resource and onto the new one
1061418921 [2233] <pam/#webco> maybe just needs a warning, are you sure type thing?
1061418959 [2239] <pam/#webco> ok, i am going to file and milestone 3.1.1
1061419186 [2253] <pam/#webco> ok, I will email them
1061419284 [2263] <pam/#webco> ok, tomorrow can you please take a look at uiuc, i am out and that has been hanging for a while, i should have followed up sooner, sorry

1061570062 [4805] <pam/#webco> howdy
1061570496 [4836] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you want me to handle alberto or do you want to schedule upgrade after 5pm?
1061570522 [4840] <pam/#webco> i don't mind calling him and talking him out of his current attitude
1061570553 [4849] <pam/#webco> np
1061580205 [5316] <pam/#webco> ayres: there seems to be some changed to 3.1 invoices. I am not sure if there are bugs or not, do you have some time to review with me?  I assumed you made the changes but I could be wrong
1061580746 [5348] <pam/#webco> no thanks josh
1061581134 [5378] <pam/#webco> ayres: still around?
1061581180 [5382] <pam/#webco> did you see my request to review invoices in 3.1?  can we review or do you want to put off til monday?
1061581232 [5395] <pam/#webco> sure thing
1061581692 [5422] <pam/#webco> there is a new feature in 3.1 for "Renew Selected" what is the purpose of this?  Are you trying to store two different due back at times for one allocation?
1061582578 [5430] <pam/#webco> is anyone still here
1061582587 [5434] <pam/#webco> who works on 3.1
1061582598 [5443] <pam/#webco> who knows anything about renew selected?
1061582626 [5448] <pam/#webco> ok, i filed bug, we'll do it the proper way, whatever
1061584837 [5539] <pam/#webco> email seems to be no good in 3.1, do you guys want one bug or a sep. bug for all email palces that don't work, i havn't found one that does tho
1061584899 [5548] <pam/#webco> ok

1061585148 [5554] <pam/#webco> am i just missing it?
1061585179 [5558] <pam/#webco> i can't help it, it's soooooo good
1061585335 [5574] <pam/#webco> dag: can you find email bug?
1061585346 [5578] <pam/#webco> less whatever it is you are doing and more me pls
1061585496 [5595] <pam/#webco> dag: my mac g3 is having trouble with runing browsers and I am going to take josh's machine when he leaves.  if we can fix the g3 you can have it for testing i think
1061585523 [5599] <pam/#webco> may just take a clean install to get back into shape
1061585586 [5612] <pam/#webco> josh/refusenik: devenr lost their custome email templates on upgrade, i opened a new buggie for support action
1061587047 [5645] <pam/#webco> thanks dag
1061587598 [5652] <pam/#webco> yeah, those developers cant be trusted
1061587882 [5654] <pam/#webco> josh: did you see email from usc?
1061587907 [5656] <pam/#webco> hey josh, how about right now, 430 on a friday?
1061588290 [5694] <pam/#webco> dag: you are on a pc laptop, yes?
1061588423 [5721] <pam/#webco> dag: i am getting weird bug but I want to see if it is more than a osx/ie issue, can you open a department I just created and try clicking on one of the department codes I made and tell me what the interface looks like
1061588441 [5723] <pam/#webco> pls
1061588453 [5729] <pam/#webco> cry
1061588462 [5731] <pam/#webco> you can't run browser?
1061588473 [5740] <pam/#webco> so how are you testing at all?
1061589915 [5793] <pam/#webco> refusenik: it is your call if you want to upgrade baylor after hours
1061589941 [5795] <pam/#webco> i guess it may be the lesser of two evils if something goes wrong
1061590974 [5884] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am sending reply to alberto with a really big we are doing you a favor feel
1061591127 [5898] <pam/#webco> hehe
1061594137 [5935] <pam/#webco> me too
1061826280 [6084] <pam/#webco> hello
1061829487 [6115] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you look at bug #6080 today?  denver custom email config was lost on upgrade
1061829602 [6121] <pam/#webco> thanks
1061830010 [6124] <pam/#webco> ayres: on the take offline for repair being bundled with the take offline feature in 3.1, what do you think about changing the wording on the link to include both for those with help desk enabled?  like "take offline/take offline for repair"
1061830092 [6133] <pam/#webco> cool, I will reopen bug 
1061830178 [6158] <pam/#webco> i like the change, the workflow is nice but we will confuse users who have learned the other way
1061830231 [6172] <pam/#webco> as long as we can agree on a wording that is more clear, I expect no matter what we will get calls from folks who are used to the way it is
1061830443 [6184] <pam/#webco> looks up tautological and expands her world
1061830655 [6194] <pam/#webco> dan suggest take offline and create trouble ticket, for all, even if they don't have help desk
1061830706 [6204] <pam/#webco> that works for me
1061830759 [6216] <pam/#webco> that is why the "and" is helpful and maybe not too verbose
1061831399 [6236] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i think we did it at the end of last year so my mail from then is gone, sorry, do you think you can find it somewhere?  
1061831546 [6242] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ithaca just emailed that the time on the server is set back to central again and they need to be on eastern, this is causing workflow issues for them today so I think this may trump the denver email thing , i just opened bug #6082 for it
1061831934 [6253] <pam/#webco> refusenik: if we are going to put the new level 1, level 2 stuff into place it may be better to leave the responding to emails to support within the process so we don't both email clients on the same issue, like the ithaca time issue
1061831999 [6255] <pam/#webco> refusenik: so I will respond to support emails and open bugs, you accept bug and handle the technical back and forth of questions while you are working out the issues, then whey you are done, reassign bug to me and I will send final email stating the issues has been resolved, how does that sound?
1061832006 [6259] <pam/#webco> ayres: perfect, just let me know when you are ready
1061832595 [6268] <pam/#webco> refusenik: np, it will just take a little time to get used to it
1061832623 [6272] <pam/#webco> plus i know how much you love to respond to the "how do I turn my computer on again?" type support questions
1061832788 [6289] <pam/#webco> ayres: sure, you want to come up or me down?  there is no one else up here so we will disturb less up here
1061836237 [6334] <pam/#webco> ayres: another invoicing question, what is the Invoice Type "Incomplete Recharge" for?
1061836317 [6351] <pam/#webco> ok, i will check it out
1061836422 [6363] <pam/#webco> ok, I think I can find it
1061836707 [6382] <pam/#webco> crap accd root types not showing up in applet again, needs reindexing, why does this keep happening?
1061837156 [6451] <pam/#webco> ok, just reopened p1 blocker on support action for accd, #5626, adam, you want to help out with that one?
1061837337 [6463] <pam/#webco> adam: yeah, they can't make reservations/checkout because they can't get to their resources in the applet, they are not showing up
1061837354 [6469] <pam/#webco> thanks
1061837795 [6496] <pam/#webco> adam: media warehouse
1061837870 [6504] <pam/#webco> thanks adam
1061837980 [6516] <pam/#webco> refusenik: should I try to get lori at denver to resend the email changes she sent in?  its a little embarassing but if we have to we have to
1061838004 [6521] <pam/#webco> adam: what is that email for?
1061838048 [6533] <pam/#webco> ok, I will send email to Rik and let him know we reindexed and ask him who he wants to get those emails
1061838407 [6548] <pam/#webco> ok, left msg for lori, i will let you know when I hear back
1061842415 [95] <pam/#webco> gracchus: can you comment on a bug you own about bulk printing of invoices please, bug #4941, you had marked it as fixed on the 3.0.x milestone.  I could not find it in 3.0.4 or 3.1, I reopened but you did not comment.  Do you want me to remilestone to 3.1 and get lee to look at since he is doing other invoice related work (as long as lee is ok with it)
1061842549 [103] <pam/#webco> gracchus: well you own the bug so wouldn't that be more apparent to you or no?
1061843274 [112] <pam/#webco> now ithaca needs reindexing
1061843278 [114] <pam/#webco> who wants that one?
1061843397 [120] <pam/#webco> thanks 
1061843418 [126] <pam/#webco> ellen says you are her hero
1061844825 [142] <pam/#webco> refusenik: emailed jason and reopened bug #6085

1061849139 [413] <pam/#webco> adam: i got the email address for accd, do you want me to open a bug for you or just paste it into irc?

1061850972 [536] <pam/#webco> morning sometime, i was not specific and said baring any unforeseen problems
1061852754 [569] <pam/#webco> refusenik: are we rescheduling baylor upgrade?
1061853194 [576] <pam/#webco> shouldn't we send email or call to let them know
1061853664 [581] <pam/#webco> I called alberto and let him know we will be rescheduling.  He is fine and will look for an email tomorrow to discuss a new date
1061854303 [586] <pam/#webco> oh, are we still doing it tonight just later?  alberto said it was fine to do a different night
1061854578 [592] <pam/#webco> ok, i have to go, if you are doing it tonight can someone shoot alberto an email or phone msg to let him know that, he is planning on setting a different date
1061921313 [597] <pam/#webco> refusenik: amanda from utah sent in a problme report that she said may be related to an issue she discussed with you last week, do you remember or did you file a bug?
1061922582 [626] <pam/#webco> refusenik: we need to reschedule baylor upgrade, do you have a preference of what eve I suggest for alberto?
1061922656 [633] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, did you talk to alberto at all or still unadressed with him?
1061922688 [637] <pam/#webco> ok
1061922823 [647] <pam/#webco> ok, what are we shooting for for 3.0.5 release?
1061922933 [649] <pam/#webco> and, it did or did not get fixed for usc?
1061923226 [655] <pam/#webco> refusenik: that would be great
1061923728 [666] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok to go ahead with baylor tonight if alberto is not around?
1061924066 [676] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, tonight it is then, I will update bug

1061927106 [827] <pam/#webco> ok, I can do now if you want
1061927133 [831] <pam/#webco> i didnt really think about it last nigth like I said i would, I only thought about myself all night, selfish really
1061927209 [835] <pam/#webco> i think we should take the time to really sit down and review it like you said, do you want to set up to do that?
1061927304 [839] <pam/#webco> i have mtg today at 4 and tomorrow at 230 and possibly 330 but any other time is fine
1061927375 [843] <pam/#webco> ok, we can shoot for eleven, hows that?
1061927765 [851] <pam/#webco> refusenik: thanks for the info on utah, how do I get into their instance?  i get forbidden, you don't have permission to access /apps/wco on this server
1061928043 [864] <pam/#webco> refusenik or josh I have micheal from utah on phone needing linux help with new server, do we help? 
1061928101 [872] <pam/#webco> he asked if anyone here had grass roots linux exp and could help him out with some questions setting up new server

1061928897 [932] <pam/#webco> refusenik: we are going to need to leave it to amanda to give is more info of the problem she is having, I can't figure it out by searching around on this patrons reservation history, thanks for the try tho
1061933010 [1196] <pam/#webco> adam: my hours were set at noon to six but they have shifted as my responsibilities have increased and now are more like 1030 to 630ish, i put what I could do in that last email about support 
1061933116 [1207] <pam/#webco> adam: no, they wre four days like most others but eric asked me to make it five again starting next week which is fine.  I can do m,w,f 10am to 630pm and tues/thur 11 to 630, i have a class on tues/thur morn
1061933163 [1211] <pam/#webco> yeah, i think so 
1061933206 [1217] <pam/#webco> adam: i think we really just need someone catching the fire issues coming in the mornings 
1061933270 [1230] <pam/#webco> adam: yeah sure, esp at release time
1061933376 [1258] <pam/#webco> im still working off mine
1061933386 [1262] <pam/#webco> we could change your nam,e
1061933395 [1268] <pam/#webco> hehe
1061934125 [1335] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you check uri, I am getting mod_webapp unable to connect to host
1061934142 [1339] <pam/#webco> thks
1061934179 [1345] <pam/#webco> josh: need to make sure all your hours are logged b/f you go *sniff* for billable stuff, such as ucb
1061934210 [1356] <pam/#webco> no
1061934257 [1365] <pam/#webco> thats better
1061934417 [1391] <pam/#webco> dan has left the building
1061934420 [1393] <pam/#webco> docotor
1061934481 [1403] <pam/#webco> refusenik/josh: would the reindex problem that has come up for a couple school possibly cause a root type not to show any subtypes in the applet?
1061934504 [1407] <pam/#webco> josh: we live in a computer age, i can fire you online now
1061934557 [1417] <pam/#webco> adam: yeah monday, actually tuesday due to holiday but we actually get to face the what do we do when pam is on vacation drill right away since I am out on tuesdauy
1061934594 [1425] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, looks like uri needs an index kick in the pants
1061934603 [1427] <pam/#webco> you want a pretty bug?
1061934630 [1437] <pam/#webco> its the Indp 301 CMA Office checkout center
1061934651 [1441] <pam/#webco> sweet, you rock at this support thing!
1061934948 [1477] <pam/#webco> refusenik: it didn't work, they have several orgs, can you try to reindex them all or did you?
1061935034 [1501] <pam/#webco> poopers cause it looks like we have a major problem at uri then
1061935134 [1508] <pam/#webco> there is a root type showing up in a ccenter that it looks like no resources are scheduled in for that particular ccenter, there are subtypes not showing up in the list on the resource type detail page, im still trying to figure it out myself
1061935222 [1520] <pam/#webco> its the indp 301  ccenter, there are some resources of the type Accessories -- Cart but when you select Accessories in the applet no subtypes appear
1061935274 [1527] <pam/#webco> there are resources but the subtype does not appear in the applet so you can find them to reserve
1061935293 [1531] <pam/#webco> josh: no but one is reserved
1061935303 [1535] <pam/#webco> i think this is the resource parent of itself problme maybe
1061935366 [1541] <pam/#webco> oh wait, maybe it is the pam smokes too much crack problem
1061935411 [1547] <pam/#webco> ok, now the applet wont load, whos fucking with me?
1061935419 [1551] <pam/#webco> hehehe
1061935480 [1556] <pam/#webco> refusenik: are you doing anything currently to uri?  can you maybe kick the tires again for me?  I cant even see the applet now
1061936459 [1589] <pam/#webco> yeah, on phone with usc, be back at you in a momento
1061936491 [1595] <pam/#webco> refusnik: its ok, uri will still be there in the morning
1061936507 [1603] <pam/#webco> damn

1062694255 [8618] <pam/#webco> kreig: are you going to send laure at sfsu an email about the data?  she is reviewing but seems pretty happy overall.  There is an error if you try to serach on specific criteria, not sure if you know that already
1062694487 [8623] <pam/#webco> kreig: no, you said last night you were going to write up an email about the data
1062694494 [8625] <pam/#webco> maybe i misunderstood

1062698141 [8832] <pam/#webco> kreig: so ithaca is good to go now?
1062698233 [8834] <pam/#webco> kreig: email came in from sysadmin at msu with a couple of questions about back up, how do we want to handle these types of support questions, still me open bug or just ping you to answer or what?
1062698424 [8847] <pam/#webco> i don't think it does, just some questions about back up
1062698445 [8849] <pam/#webco> what do you want to do in those cases?
1062698635 [8872] <pam/#webco> sure
1062698642 [8874] <pam/#webco> ithaca is good, yes?
1062698803 [8894] <pam/#webco> kreig: my only concern is that questions like this will take a long time to get answered, how do we want to handle, its not really a p1 issue by maybe it is?
1062698881 [8899] <pam/#webco> kreig: also, we decided to reassigne support action bugs to me to close when I send final email, such as ithca one, that way i dont miss some
1062698900 [8903] <pam/#webco> was it?  i thought you closed it, 
1062698907 [8908] <pam/#webco> oh
1062699028 [8923] <pam/#webco> kreig: no, assigned to you and clo/fixed, i would prefer assigned to me and still open so I can find easily
1062699105 [8943] <pam/#webco> kreig: your response to my question about the msu types of questions is not helpful, how are we going to make sure these types of questions get answered in a timely manner?  
1062700007 [9011] <pam/#webco> kreig: you are working on usc right?  are you working on cinapps stuff or those bugs they sent in, i have not filed them yet so I assume other stuff?
1062703495 [9159] <pam/#webco> what does that mean

1062775861 [9821] <pam/#webco> refusenik: are you still working on utah debian thing today
1062775869 [9823] <pam/#webco> there are some open support issues that need some attention
1062775911 [9833] <pam/#webco> oh, i see that now, thanks
1062775920 [9835] <pam/#webco> great
1062776836 [9844] <pam/#webco> craig: what state was usc in by the end of the day yesterday?  anything to follow up on today?
1062778629 [9854] <pam/#webco> uh, what happened to beta?  it loads with a ton of equipment in the selected resource box, doh
1062779158 [9864] <pam/#webco> moooch better
1062779226 [9866] <pam/#webco> mallard: can we chat about bug #6069 for a sec?
1062779241 [9874] <pam/#webco> its the one where it appears that focus is given to the patron box 
1062779250 [9877] <pam/#webco> but you have to click it again to actually type in it
1062779258 [9879] <pam/#webco> you marked it as fixed but I am getting the same behavior
1062779262 [9881] <pam/#webco> is it my mac/ie?
1062779278 [9883] <pam/#webco> do you see this behavior?
1062780523 [9911] <pam/#webco> they are working on orders and then committing and losing them, see bug #6148
1062780542 [9913] <pam/#webco> craigb was sitting on the debugger yesterday but there is no update 
1062780558 [9915] <pam/#webco> maybe I need to call craig and see where he left it
1062780616 [9921] <pam/#webco> it seemed it was part of what he was working on yesterday, in addition to the server/cpu thing
1062780663 [9929] <pam/#webco> the confirmation error? according to joel it is happening intermitently
1062780680 [9935] <pam/#webco> yes 
1062780705 [9937] <pam/#webco> joel called in one this morning and claimed that he hit commit and lost a 100 order item, without an error
1062780711 [9939] <pam/#webco> that is seperate issue
1062780726 [9943] <pam/#webco> he says the error one comes up a couple of times for his order placers
1062780745 [9945] <pam/#webco> he may have hit the reset button which is very close to the confirm and does not have an are you sure process
1062780760 [9949] <pam/#webco> well, i am not conviced of joels error
1062780771 [9953] <pam/#webco> right
1062780788 [9957] <pam/#webco> i am more concerned with the errors they reported yesterday that joel says continue today
1062780790 [9959] <pam/#webco> yes
1062780800 [9963] <pam/#webco> i need to call craig first
1062780919 [9973] <pam/#webco> i agree, this drives me nuts too
1062781031 [9981] <pam/#webco> ayres_ i have craig on phone, he has an idea of how to move forward with usc if you have some time to talk to him
1062781070 [9989] <pam/#webco> sorry, nevermind, now he thinks they sould wait for him to return on mondya
1062785724 [10060] <pam/#webco> ayres_: did beta get update?
1062785931 [10079] <pam/#webco> oh adam
1062785970 [10089] <pam/#webco> no
1062786058 [10107] <pam/#webco> practices ignoring adam
1062786137 [10122] <pam/#webco> craigl is trying to work out the utah thing 
1062786313 [10144] <pam/#webco> sigh, now ithaca has the transaction inactive bug
1062786390 [10156] <pam/#webco> i know, they just freak out because of it, i will sooth ellens little heart
1062789179 [10341] <pam/#webco> mallard: i am still having this focus issue, do you want to come view on my machine?
1062789883 [10355] <pam/#webco> ubc facEd dept webco is down, they restarted their server and one instance came up but the other no so much, can i get someone to take a look?
1062790535 [10373] <pam/#webco> no, they are not in production so when you have a chance would be great
1062790582 [10378] <pam/#webco> thank you
1063035282 [10626] <pam/#webco> morning
1063035293 [10628] <pam/#webco> refusenik: still on the utah debian thing?
1063035320 [10632] <pam/#webco> oy, poor thing, that sux
1063035485 [10636] <pam/#webco> yeah, im gonna ask him, he is up here
1063036056 [10655] <pam/#webco> when I get a support guy free can you pls check with me cause I have several open bugs that need to be addressed and some are more pressing than other
1063036912 [10664] <pam/#webco> first peek at ithaca problem #6173
1063036942 [10666] <pam/#webco> and then chapman patron problem #6149
1063036955 [10670] <pam/#webco> and then answer msu question in #6159
1063036957 [10672] <pam/#webco> :)
1063038749 [10684] <pam/#webco> kreig: what are you referring to?
1063038966 [10692] <pam/#webco> kreig: we have been going along for quite some time by setting deadlines in the bug, how would you prefer they be handled? its not like you cant say you don't think something can get done by the set date but what is the problem with putting an expectation out there?
1063039309 [10740] <pam/#webco> well support isnt that easy, most things just come in with a few days to turn it around, we put the deadlines in the bug header, watch the support list every day and manage them against bugs that come in
1063039354 [10742] <pam/#webco> we can move deadlines as long as we advise the customer but it is a daily juggle of expectations/deadlines, I don't think you can process around that, it is part of the beast
1063039542 [10760] <pam/#webco> that would be good, just want to do when i get in? quick whats up today mtg
1063039553 [10762] <pam/#webco> yep, deadlines can get flushed out there
1063039593 [10766] <pam/#webco> refusenik: have an opinion?
1063041041 [10832] <pam/#webco> kreig: i closed 6149 worksforme and emailed chapman, issue appears to not be happening, may have been something on their end of the integration that they fixed for themselves, tis good
1063049779 [10967] <pam/#webco> kreig: you see email from laurie about the sfsu staged instance?
1063051058 [10975] <pam/#webco> is there something going on with beta currently?  i keep loosing the interface, just goes blank and I have to refresh or relog in
1063051638 [10993] <pam/#webco> gives up testing beta
1063054201 [11130] <pam/#webco> kreig: i just opened two p1/crits for quinnipiac who went into production today, fines and emails are not working for them, when you free they should be next in the queue
1063054232 [11135] <pam/#webco> now i must call ellen at ithaca, poor ellen
1063054305 [11142] <pam/#webco> kreig: i tested, they are real issues

1063138536 [12012] <pam/#webco> dag: i think i did it
1063138586 [12018] <pam/#webco> that problme with adding an rtype that has no availabilty to allocation hangs the system is nasty, i upgraded to p1/crit
1063138614 [12023] <pam/#webco> i dont see how we can role out to a vangaurd with that still open
1063138619 [12027] <pam/#webco> roll
1063139958 [12064] <pam/#webco> something seems very wacked out at umich
1063140190 [12068] <pam/#webco> it took me a min but then hehehe
1063143876 [12128] <pam/#webco> adam: i talked to kelly and chris at ucla, chris will review the data and respond to your email and he said the only part of their workflow they have not tested in 3.1 is invoicing.  Chris is going to do that and we set a time to talk again on Friday
1063143936 [12134] <pam/#webco> yeah, i told them it would be early next week if we don't have any major issues pop up
1063144518 [12148] <pam/#webco> my pleasure 
1063145487 [12157] <pam/#webco> i think you can take off your hat and boots and git on home
1063148386 [12180] <pam/#webco> going home
1063207431 [12232] <pam/#webco> kreig: does max have to take webcheckout off line to edit the email template directory?
1063207494 [12240] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1063207649 [12242] <pam/#webco> kreig: i assume andy starr is talking to his own staff about checking the integration and just cc'ing us, you agree?
1063207760 [12250] <pam/#webco> you cant tell from his email if that is something his staff can do or is something we have to do?
1063208516 [12275] <pam/#webco> kreig: im gonna come down for our daily update mtg, now good?
1063208525 [12277] <pam/#webco> ayres: i filed a couple of invoice bugs on 3.1 just now
1063208569 [12281] <pam/#webco> feel the love
1063209985 [12294] <pam/#webco> kreig: i have training today from 330 til 530 so i will need you to be on phones then
1063210088 [12296] <pam/#webco> kreig: tomorrow too
1063210904 [12306] <pam/#webco> kreig: accd dba checked their file, he says it looks fine, all patrons active and ran on schedule last night, opened p1 blocker 6200, pls pick up
1063211964 [12317] <pam/#webco> kreig: what happened
1063212762 [12370] <pam/#webco> kreig: umich issue is that the max c/res policy is set to 6 days but no matter what the length of your allocation you have to do the override.  I put on 3.0.5 and advised jeff to add the override to his operators until we can get it worked out
1063213553 [12380] <pam/#webco> kreig: you advising them?
1063220179 [12470] <pam/#webco> kreig: is there someway we can tell why the chapman patron integration was running in the middle of the day?  its not set up to do that i think
1063220338 [12478] <pam/#webco> just making sure that the time to run integration isnt set to the wrong time, it was def. someone on their end running it out of the normal run process
1063220860 [12503] <pam/#webco> so we cant help them when they say it takes an hour to make one reservation?
1063220952 [12513] <pam/#webco> oh, i didn't interpret it that way\
1063220969 [12517] <pam/#webco> pam is already grumpy
1063220980 [12519] <pam/#webco> loves support
1063221019 [12523] <pam/#webco> wonderwhiner = hehehehe
1063221202 [12533] <pam/#webco> kreig: i can try
1063221259 [12541] <pam/#webco> you should be able to plop it in my folder on prep
1063222072 [12565] <pam/#webco> kreig: got it
1063222331 [12580] <pam/#webco> ok, take a min, ill let you know
1063224802 [12602] <pam/#webco> i think i just hosed beta again, is anyone looking into this horrible rrt bug yet?  its really hard to test  with this
1063224875 [12605] <pam/#webco> it came back to life
1063225395 [12610] <pam/#webco> dag: if you try to pick up a reservation that has both rtype and resources on it by using the pickup button on the contents tab you will reproduce dans bug report, it does not happen if you hit pickup button on the left side
1063225426 [12617] <pam/#webco> i am updating bug
1063225508 [12625] <pam/#webco> yeah, i saw it happen so I knew there had to be a recipe for it
1063297990 [12946] <pam/#webco> no food for you
1063298022 [12948] <pam/#webco> it looks like tues/thurs is going to be more like 1130 start time for me, ive tried but with traffic I cant get here at eleven from class
1063298708 [12953] <pam/#webco> kreig: i opened #6209 for chapman error reports and added your email to it
1063299069 [12966] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i dont know
1063299147 [12976] <pam/#webco> refusenik: are you asking me to take care of it?  i didn't realize it was still here/needed to go back
1063299247 [12982] <pam/#webco> ah, maybe assign bug to dan?
1063300006 [12993] <pam/#webco> refusenik: whats on your to do list today?
1063300522 [13008] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you get that last little fix to the denver email bug and try to get me back into denver to check another issue she reported?
1063300579 [13017] <pam/#webco> the denver email bug that is assigned to you, hold on and I can find the number
1063300648 [13026] <pam/#webco> she reported on an invoice bug but I need to test to confirm in the denver instance cause it aint happening on demo
1063300662 [13029] <pam/#webco> its #6144 assigned to me
1063301720 [13099] <pam/#webco> = grouchy
1063302308 [13119] <pam/#webco> thanks kreig, got what i needed
1063302340 [13122] <pam/#webco> kreig: you moved chapman bug to 3.0.5 but did they get a patch or wait for release?
1063303760 [13142] <pam/#webco> thats cool
1063305786 [13166] <pam/#webco> no
1063307237 [13192] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i am running osx up here is you need to test something on it
1063312784 [13268] <pam/#webco> kreig/refusenik: i am about to get on my training call so you will lose me for the rest of the afternoon
1063315593 [13310] <pam/#webco> please please please
1063377911 [13471] <pam/#webco> hola
1063378371 [13482] <pam/#webco> refusenik: yeah, ill be down a little after 10 ok?
1063380955 [13521] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ready for support mtg?
1063387742 [13575] <pam/#webco> ayres: the nasty issue with picking an rtype that didn't have any availalbe hanging the whole system seems to have stopped :)
1063387971 [13583] <pam/#webco> really? i havn't hit is yet, weird
1063388463 [13587] <pam/#webco> ok
1063388646 [13591] <pam/#webco> ayres: the box where you can drop down the all the avail. resources of an rtype and choose one besides the suggested outgoing when picking up a reservation w/rrt is gone, was that intentional?
1063388660 [13597] <pam/#webco> ok, ill file
1063399481 [13689] <pam/#webco> refusenik: yeah, he was responding to something craigb sent him
1063399743 [13711] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok
1063402462 [13729] <pam/#webco> refusenik: sorry, was not paying attention.  I had you reindex them when they first reported the issue and it didnt work, weird that it worked this time, but glad it did!
1063402493 [13731] <pam/#webco> do you still need me to explain unseralized and contained? they aren't releated btw
1063403081 [13735] <pam/#webco> oh, ic
1063403092 [13739] <pam/#webco> i can help with that
1063403097 [13741] <pam/#webco> call up, its easier
1063403128 [13743] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you pls reassigne support action bugs to me when you are done instead of resolving them?  that way I can track who needs the wrap up email
1063405750 [13755] <pam/#webco> me toooo
1063639425 [14299] <pam/#webco> good morning

1063650861 [14424] <pam/#webco> what is holding it up?
1063650864 [14426] <pam/#webco> can you tell?
1063650932 [14432] <pam/#webco> it just hangs
1063650947 [14434] <pam/#webco> why would confirm-alloc tie up everything this bad this long?
1063651136 [14442] <pam/#webco> can we kick and restart? they have a line of people and they cant operate
1063651489 [14456] <pam/#webco> thanks!
1063657603 [14564] <pam/#webco> adam: i spoke with ucla on friday about going vangaurd, did you see chris d's email response to your request to check data?
1063657647 [14572] <pam/#webco> adam: to you, no list
1063659790 [14585] <pam/#webco> adam: i can forward to you
1063659817 [14587] <pam/#webco> ok, resent to you and ccd support
1063660547 [14606] <pam/#webco> adam: yeah that one, i willfind bug number for you too
1063660592 [14615] <pam/#webco> anything else that needs to get fixed before we can release to them?
1063660623 [14617] <pam/#webco> np
1063660806 [14631] <pam/#webco> adam: keep in mind that eric is probably going to sell rrt to ucla so we cant completly discount the bugs that remain there
1063663934 [14672] <pam/#webco> gots to run today
1063663937 [14674] <pam/#webco> see you all tomorrow
1063732457 [15243] <pam/#webco> kreig: are you done with the g4 box?
1063732678 [15245] <pam/#webco> refusenik or kreig: uchicago looks to have a serious problme with resource/resource types, just filed bug 6234, can one of you take a look?
1063732903 [15255] <pam/#webco> also umich has problem with their marc integration, filed p1/crit support action #6235
1063732922 [15258] <pam/#webco> kreig/refusenik maybe i should come down for a support mtg, is now a good time?
1063735060 [15287] <pam/#webco> refusenik: umich email that they went down again at 12:30
1063735903 [15289] <pam/#webco>  http://support.webcheckout.net/wco/admin/stopping.starting.html
1063736403 [15312] <pam/#webco> gracchus thank you for trying, adam is going to get them back up
1063736645 [15322] <pam/#webco> yes adam, thank you
1063737116 [15353] <pam/#webco> adam: ok, we need to figure out something that works then, maybe a topic for our staff mtg today
1063738118 [15446] <pam/#webco> refusenik/kreig: how many times do i have to ask that you guys not go to lunch at the same time, as soon as you leave umich goes down
1063738172 [15454] <pam/#webco> no i didn't, i said dont leave me without 2nd level support, mondays was a bad day because that was when josh was off but josh is gone now
1063738198 [15456] <pam/#webco> you cant figure that out without a post it note, thats ridiculous
1063738266 [15460] <pam/#webco> i am sure i was very clear about what the purpose being not leaving me w/o help \
1063738391 [15478] <pam/#webco> yes, i understand that there may be holes that are inevitable, but minimizing would be best
1063738425 [15490] <pam/#webco> plus, no one even puts in irc that they are going so I am wasting my time running around trying to find them, then wasting time (and others) by pulling people to help
1063738515 [15504] <pam/#webco> I dont feel i have time to learn a new item but I could try, what would that accomplish
1063738780 [15564] <pam/#webco> adam: i am fine with documenting it, it just is a bit much to say i have to learn cvs in order for it to get documented and get enforced
1063739132 [15624] <pam/#webco> i didn't bring in sales, they sit next to me and can tell when i get pissy about something
1063740612 [15774] <pam/#webco> kreig/refusenik: syracuse called in a display resource type issue, i would like to investigate further but I think a good first step would be to reindex rtypes, filed #6240, when one of you has time pls pickup
1063741200 [15794] <pam/#webco> thanks
1063741437 [15805] <pam/#webco> thanks

1063741779 [15843] <pam/#webco> kreig: the g3 is a little under the weather fyi, loading a browser crashes the whole system
1063741787 [15845] <pam/#webco> may just need a fresh install of OS
1063741832 [15856] <pam/#webco> esp. when you abuse the crap out of one for six or seven years
1063741854 [15862] <pam/#webco> yes it has
1063741867 [15866] <pam/#webco> it was carmels box before mine and I have been here for 5 years
1063741878 [15868] <pam/#webco> that is what I am saying

1063918073 [18139] <pam/#webco> oh, it looks like we removed the one resource on that allocation from bug 5495 but did not cancel the reservation
1063918117 [18143] <pam/#webco> can I just delete from the interface? it looks like it should have cancelled itself since it was for 9/12
1063918209 [18147] <pam/#webco> oh
1063918219 [18151] <pam/#webco> ok

1064257141 [2322] <pam/#webco> adam: i think ucla is ready when we are for vangaurd so if we give the ok they will take it
1064259185 [2404] <pam/#webco> refusenik/kreig: i am opening a p1/maj for evergreen filedrop button missing
1064262582 [2537] <pam/#webco> refusenik: evergreen wants to know how long til they have a fix for integration button and if we can run it cause they are busy, what are your thoughts, wont running the integration now keep them from being able to use the system?
1064262689 [2560] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you know a rough est of how long they will be down, i want to make sure dave understands before he asks us to just do it for him
1064262704 [2567] <pam/#webco> so they can run their integration
1064336876 [3218] <pam/#onshored> hi josh!!
1064342954 [3293] <pam/#webco> does anyone use the 401k through administaff?
1064345840 [3340] <pam/#webco> refusnenik: when you have a couple of min can we discuss a printing issue at accd? no need to stop what you are doing, just when you can would work
1064345964 [3347] <pam/#webco> ok, im gonna call
1064350179 [3384] <pam/#webco> refuesnik: no, sorry, I will try tonight, I took my laptop with me over the weekend but forgot my power cord, its so hard to be this intelligent
1064350975 [3400] <pam/#webco> ucla is ready to go vangaurd, we can set it up any time tomorrow
1064352483 [3478] <pam/#webco> evergreen has a blocker that needs to get addressed b/f they can go vangaurd, 6288
1064352521 [3483] <pam/#webco> just talked to davec we are putting off the vangaurd release until thurs, pending a fix for that report
1064352552 [3486] <pam/#webco> do I need to open a bug for the ucla vangaurd release to take place tomorrow?
1064355220 [3708] <pam/#webco> me go
1064416358 [3947] <pam/#webco> good morning
1064419551 [4095] <pam/#webco> ayres: i dont think davec will take a vangaurd release until he sees the fix for that blocker you just closed so if we wait to update beta I wont be able to set up a release plan until then
1064419578 [4097] <pam/#webco> ayres: and I think he wants it sooner if we can get it to him
1064419587 [4103] <pam/#webco> any objections to updating the beta today?
1064419937 [4111] <pam/#webco> adam: ok
1064420031 [4126] <pam/#webco> ok adam, I will try to keep an eye out for versions b/f releasing to clients as well
1064420076 [4130] <pam/#webco> i can open bug on that and maybe jesse could update when he has some time?
1064420086 [4134] <pam/#webco> ok
1064421817 [4229] <pam/#webco> kreig/refusenik: uchicago needs rtype/resource reindex
1064422150 [4301] <pam/#webco> kreig: thanks, is there a command we can give to scott wilson so he can run this himself?
1064422270 [4316] <pam/#webco> kreig: he asked for it all, I told him 3.05 release is days away at longest and seems good with that but is it a big deal to just give it to him just in case it happens again, i think this #3 for them
1064422311 [4319] <pam/#webco> kreig: your call really
1064422386 [4327] <pam/#webco> ok then

1064425947 [4486] <pam/#webco> kreig: reopened #5713
1064426852 [4541] <pam/#webco> kreig: i am not trying to be a stickler, just trying to find errors, you are correct that I misunderstood the bug, i dont think having a comma there should be a show stopper
1064427051 [4571] <pam/#webco> what? 5693 is about setting default pickup/return options i thought
1064427161 [4590] <pam/#webco> kreig: oic
1064429151 [4755] <pam/#webco> kreig: uri having trouble with printing at one or their checkout centers suddenly today, I am opening p1/maj support action

1064442492 [5835] <pam/#webco> adam: you want me to put that as a blocker against 3.1?
1064442528 [5839] <pam/#webco> bye kreig
1064442965 [5845] <pam/#webco> adam: dave c has sent a couple of emails responding the request to upgrade their server before they go vangaurd, have you seen, his IT people are telling him two weeks before they can prepare the server as requested, ouch
1064443209 [5858] <pam/#webco> well that was his plan before the server problem came to light this morning
1064443300 [5861] <pam/#webco> I spoke to him yesterday and the only thing in the way was one blocker that was closed this morning so if the server had been ready I would have tried to set up the release to him tomorrow
1064443347 [5865] <pam/#webco> yes, it was fixed and then updated late this morning by lee and dave checked it out 
1064443373 [5871] <pam/#webco> ooof, do you have that kind of time?
1064443388 [5880] <pam/#webco> two weeks is a long time to wait to let them go 
1064443463 [5890] <pam/#webco> ok, i will ask dave when they can be down for that amount of time
1064443479 [5892] <pam/#webco> are you against after hours?
1064443490 [5896] <pam/#webco> altho it is a three hour time diff for you
1064443542 [5902] <pam/#webco> ok, i will try and see what he has to say
1064443550 [5904] <pam/#webco> doesn't matter, I can if you like
1064443568 [5910] <pam/#webco> ok
1064443674 [5937] <pam/#webco> ok, going home
1064510045 [6459] <pam/#webco> hi there
1064510063 [6461] <pam/#webco> crapy accd news
1064510149 [6465] <pam/#webco> having to convince them to rearrange their locations
1064510177 [6467] <pam/#webco> after they spent several months doing inventory and building their location scheme
1064510400 [6471] <pam/#webco> um, no, we dont usually make any suggestions for creating locations
1064510455 [6477] <pam/#webco> ill come down and talk
1064512688 [6511] <pam/#webco> accd was surprisingly all good with re-orging their locations, yeah!
1064512767 [6517] <pam/#webco> they do, they like the new feature of veiw by location so he was very accepting of the change
1064513304 [6532] <pam/#webco> oh yeah, I didnt thing of that
1064514282 [6539] <pam/#webco> ok, called rik back

1064520127 [6727] <pam/#webco> kreig: closed
1064521020 [6752] <pam/#webco> kreig: there is something still not quite right with the rtypes, like the reindex problem, not all heir showing in the applet
1064521116 [6760] <pam/#webco> if you go to MCR location, click on DV Tape Editing root type, you see Video Editor then under that Digital Editor but digital editor should have about six or seven subs that do not appear in applet
1064521150 [6768] <pam/#webco> the one you just gave me, alpha.onshored.com/craig/wco
1064523031 [6929] <pam/#webco> ok kreig
1064524202 [7035] <pam/#webco> kreig: there does still seem to be something wrong, if there are no resource under DV Tape Editing -- Video Editor -- Digital Editor -- subtype of digital editor, why is DV Tape Editing, Video Editor, Digital Editor in the applet at all?  If I click through the chain of rtypes to digital eidtor and then select it, the arrow next to it disappears and no subs appear, I may have to show you this
1064524522 [7045] <pam/#webco> faults them in?

1065022675 [11425] <pam/#webco> gracchus: can I get a bug number on that?
1065022714 [11429] <pam/#webco> I don't know which one you are talking about, I havnt been paying close attention to vangaurd since it was not going through support channels
1065023332 [11432] <pam/#webco> i tried to log into ucla and got the following:  Error:  java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
1065023812 [11434] <pam/#webco> kreig/refusenik: just opened p1/crit against umich
1065024339 [11458] <pam/#webco> so i dont need to check this, wait for wyatt to do, oh ok
1065024889 [11489] <pam/#webco> kreig: what is the support vmail pword?
1065025065 [11507] <pam/#webco> kreig: ucla url I tried was 164.67.141.16, production 3.1
1065026904 [11675] <pam/#webco> kreig: i have wyatt, can I transfer to you?
1065040653 [11949] <pam/#webco> ok, im gonna go let in the gas man
1065113276 [12378] <pam/#webco> i have rick at accd on the phone and he doesnt remember who he was talking to about beta, was it lee or jesse?
1065113296 [12386] <pam/#webco> yep
1065113336 [12394] <pam/#webco> ill transfer in a moment
1065113424 [12424] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you know about accd problems on their production instance, i have not read email yet so bare with me
1065113624 [12472] <pam/#webco> is that what is causing the "new problems" after the upgrade?
1065113665 [12475] <pam/#webco> rick said his workers can do one or two things and then the screen goes blank and they have to restart the browser/webcheckout, that is def. new it that is really what is happening
1065113779 [12486] <pam/#webco> refusenik: that is not the point
1065113794 [12488] <pam/#webco> whatever you want to call it, the problem still exists
1065114314 [12540] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i dont know with these fargin ri(c)ks; rick was relaying to me something he "thinks" rik talked to you about but it is causing "lots of headaches" for everyone.....oy, I will call rik and try to get more details as to what the hell rick is talking about
1065114436 [12558] <pam/#webco> ayres: do not hesitate to tell rick that his expectations for things are too high because they always are and I am always explaining that to him
1065114476 [12568] <pam/#webco> a bugzilla, hehe
1065114764 [12591] <pam/#webco> refusenik: they are both in contacts, I dont understand what you mean exactly, you want to know which one is the sane normal one and which one is the "good people" one?
1065114894 [12604] <pam/#webco> rik delisle is the normal one and rick torres is the freaky one, good people, always fare to midland
1065114915 [12606] <pam/#webco> and the one ayres was just on the phone with
1065115052 [12614] <pam/#webco> ucla production 3.1 instance still appears to be down, I opened blocker 6366
1065115072 [12617] <pam/#webco> they both are actually media warehouse supervisors
1065115082 [12621] <pam/#webco> not sure of their exact titles
1065115091 [12623] <pam/#webco> yeah, they dont make it easy
1065115131 [12629] <pam/#webco> yeah so he may be the Media Warehouse Supervisor's Supervisor now
1065116149 [12701] <pam/#webco> refusenik: there is something wacky with accd, the applet screen doesnt always load, it just brings up a blank grey screen and  you have to move off and back on to try and view the applet, I am going to open a p1/crit that really should take a high priority
1065116200 [12713] <pam/#onshored> yay, new office and tomorrow a new home, lots of changes for the g-man, and heavy boxes!
1065116527 [12742] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, bug #6367, assigned to you
1065117571 [12758] <pam/#webco> refusenik: fyi, as stated on the bug, the issue they are experiencing and I confirmed was tested in netscape and safari in addition to IE and appears in all of them
1065117899 [12783] <pam/#webco> yum yum yum yum yum
1065120187 [12886] <pam/#webco> yes, i made it happen several times
1065120272 [12892] <pam/#webco> refusenik: its not happening now tho, they said it was spuratic
1065120454 [12900] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am unable to make it happen now, should I continue to try and let you know when it does?
1065120611 [12909] <pam/#webco> refusenik: it is just not happening now, could there be any issue with network connection at certain times that could be releated to this?
1065130261 [13028] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what do you have for STCC (south texas) url in your file?  mine may be outdated and for several annoying reasons i cant use that file you sent me at the present moment
1065130432 [13035] <pam/#webco> yes, thanks
1065132943 [13061] <pam/#webco> time to go pack...see you all on monday
1065454569 [14139] <pam/#webco> kreig: is that error that brian reported the about printing the same one that is fixed in patch for 3.0.5 per bug #6327? dont want to open new bug if that is it but the error msg is not part of the bug report so I cant tell
1065454715 [14146] <pam/#webco> i will just open new bug then
1065456349 [14171] <pam/#webco> kreig: lots of support issues going on, can we have quick mtg to get on same page?
1065456379 [14180] <pam/#webco> ok, come down now
1065464931 [14258] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i just tested and it took over two minutes to load the applet, ouchy
1065465105 [14263] <pam/#webco> yes, after initial load it seems to work fine
1065477019 [14379] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did talk to rik at accd earlier about the java hanging the first load?
1065477246 [14387] <pam/#webco> ok, he emailed me, i am forwarding to support and I will update the bug with it
1065478012 [14393] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, I will re-ask him for that information
1065478064 [14400] <pam/#webco> hm, usc claims that they are getting error when using return selected and then all items are returned by someone they say is not the operator or even logged in, weird weird weird
1065478092 [14402] <pam/#webco> ahhhh, I will check out their auto-circulate and see
1065478262 [14408] <pam/#webco> i am checking logs but dont see anything about policy changes in the last 24 hous
1065478350 [14414] <pam/#webco> well, you are correct about auto-circulate, it is most def. turned on, just dont see in the logs when that was done
1065478388 [14416] <pam/#webco> what type of event would that be? administrative?
1065478591 [14418] <pam/#webco> are we tracking policy changes in system event log?  it doesnt appear there, could this have gotten turned on during the upgrade to 3.0.5?
1065478873 [14439] <pam/#webco> yep, appears so, just dont know how it got turned on, not in system event log that I can see
1065478893 [14443] <pam/#webco> who is the horseman?
1065478918 [14453] <pam/#webco> he is gone
1065478992 [14457] <pam/#webco> im leaving too
1065546381 [14657] <pam/#webco> kreig: reopened bug #6382 so lcc can get the patch you made yesterday for the set/strike print error, reported this morning
1065547135 [14671] <pam/#webco> yeah, do you guys want me to open a new bug when a different client reports a new problem so things are clear or is it ok if I just reopen?
1065547181 [14673] <pam/#webco> kreig: I just handled a stcc report of a problem on 2.0.11, do you want me to suggest to them that we move them to the 3.0 line or just leave as is?
1065551429 [14700] <pam/#webco> kreig: without projex how are folks like me supposed to see info on clients?
1065551956 [14702] <pam/#webco> usc seems to have a p1 blocker situation, they turned off auto-circulate but the system seems to still be returning checkouts
1065552078 [14716] <pam/#webco> oh, i get url not found or something like that
1065552528 [14726] <pam/#webco> thanks kreig, i updated usc bug #6386 for strange returning problem, that is the one you are on per your comment about, yes?
1065554869 [14746] <pam/#webco> i didn't open a bug on it becuase I was able to address the issue
1065554981 [14752] <pam/#webco> there is some thing going on with the system thinking an item is contained by another resource when it is not and they could not delete because of it, there is a workaroudn to get the system to allow the delete but they do need the upgrade so it does not continue to happen.  I will open bug for the upgrade when I hear back from them about when is a good time for them]
1065555252 [14756] <pam/#webco> kreig: i added the cks that usc wants rolled back to the bug
1065556453 [14770] <pam/#webco> refusenik: cool
1065556524 [14773] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i updated my os to the latest 10.2.8 and then tried to load the artcenter instance and had no delay in the applet loading but when I called rik he said they are all already on 10.2.8 and they have been seeing intermittent problems all day
1065556551 [14777] <pam/#webco> he also said that there is nothing the java console when it happens and they are running JVM 1.4.1
1065557414 [14799] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you see my long note above?
1065557456 [14812] <pam/#webco> so would it do any good to debug on my machine when I am no longer seeing the problem?
1065557481 [14818] <pam/#webco> ok, whenever you want then
1065557497 [14822] <pam/#webco> done
1065557588 [14829] <pam/#webco> ok
1065557614 [14838] <pam/#webco> "Java Messages" is the java console?
1065557651 [14848] <pam/#webco> ok, well I loaded the applet and nothing appeared at all in the java msg box
1065557716 [14855] <pam/#webco> do you want me to try anthing else?
1065557819 [14862] <pam/#webco> ok
1065557963 [14873] <pam/#webco> ie 5,2
1065558154 [14882] <pam/#webco> 1.4.1
1065558354 [14886] <pam/#webco> yeah
1065558391 [14890] <pam/#webco> nope
1065558416 [14897] <pam/#webco> where is my parting gift?

1065559086 [14915] <pam/#webco> sure thing, also pls note where you found that comment 
1065559126 [14919] <pam/#webco> even better
1065562013 [14945] <pam/#webco> its fine if you mailed the resolution to them
1065562077 [14949] <pam/#webco> so a 2.0.11 to 3.0.5 upgrade you guys need about 4 hours?
1065562150 [14953] <pam/#webco> and is Debian 3.0 a non-issue for upgrade?
1065562241 [14957] <pam/#webco> and have the craigs decided that it is easier to do the major upgrade after 5pm or do you still want me to try and schedule for bwn 9-5?
1065562648 [14975] <pam/#webco> particularly skillful? now who would fall under that?
1065562660 [14977] <pam/#webco> do we need any available support on their end during upgrade?
1065562666 [14980] <pam/#webco> these are questions from stcc btw
1065562877 [14987] <pam/#webco> ok, i will advise that we should stage first, get review and then upgrade, when can you fit in doing the staged instance?
1065562903 [14993] <pam/#webco> well, they are not whiners, we almost never hear from them but I dont know what their volume is
1065562908 [14996] <pam/#webco> ok
1065629106 [15126] <pam/#webco> kreig: accd on the phone, they had a patron file that was short this morning and they want to know if we can run it again with a new file they just put up, do we do this or can they do it themselves?
1065629481 [15133] <pam/#webco> will clicking on the file name automatically run the filedrop or will there be additional prompts?
1065634655 [15167] <pam/#webco> woot
1065634660 [15169] <pam/#webco> g3 up for grabs

1065635454 [15195] <pam/#webco> kreig: sorry, i know you are busy but somehow yesterday it seems that stcc production instance lost the repair module and they need it back asap, maybe when cbl was doing a staged instance on their server?

1066059251 [15962] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i think ithaca problem is probably user error (inexperience)  They have one cancelled reservation from today due to the pickup grace period setting and two completed checkouts that appear to be normal.

1066767432 [18100] <pam/#webco> amazingly no, however lori did report it as not being able to change the patron class when it was really that fees were not showing up so it took me a while to figure out what the hell she was talking about
1066767513 [18104] <pam/#webco> yes
1066767532 [18106] <pam/#webco> i dont see it on the policy tab at all
1066767549 [18112] <pam/#webco> ok, ill call lori and find out 
1066767706 [18116] <pam/#webco> refusenik: quinnipiac upgrade to 3.0.5 from 3.0.4.1 can be done either after 6pm at night or before 11 tomorrow, I could try to set it up for Thursday after 6pm if that is ok with you?
1066767777 [18123] <pam/#webco> ok
1066767903 [18130] <pam/#webco> is that what is in projex?
1066767923 [18136] <pam/#webco> then that is it i guess, I only saw a problem with usage fees
1066768210 [18144] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, i left msg for lori, Ill let you know when she calls me back
1066769688 [18157] <pam/#webco> thanks craig
1066771699 [18168] <pam/#webco> refusenik: are there written notes/instructions that go along with what you are going to show me?
1066773361 [18212] <pam/#webco> refusenik: if there are no written notes I dont want to do the training yet
1066836884 [18254] <pam/#webco> kreig: I am going to call rik and confirm a meeting time for you tomorrow.  His suggestion in the email was 12pm pacific so 2pm our time, ok for you?
1066836939 [18260] <pam/#webco> kreig: ok, he left me a msg last night so I just didnt want him to think I was ignoring him but better if you do it so I am not the inbetween girl
1066836980 [18266] <pam/#webco> I advised him a couple of times along the way to try Netscape 7.1, can you ask him if he tried and what the results were?
1066837000 [18270] <pam/#webco> he won't be in for a couple of hours, it is only 830am there and I dont think he start until 11am pacific
1066837022 [18272] <pam/#webco> you can always leave him a msg tho I suppose
1066837678 [18284] <pam/#webco> yeah, I would start with Scott Wilson altho he is not a day to day user he is the one they go to when they have any kind of trouble
1066837728 [18288] <pam/#webco> the only other one I can think of is sfsu but they are not using really yet
1066844953 [18309] <pam/#webco> kreig: what is the support site long in again?
1066844965 [18313] <pam/#webco> regent is down after an upgrade to their server

1066860614 [18386] <pam/#webco>  me go
1066860617 [18388] <pam/#webco> see yous on friday
1067009326 [18889] <pam/#webco> howdy
1067009429 [18893] <pam/#webco> refusenik: it is probably a good idea to send a link to the 3.0 release notes to clients when you are upgrading them from 2.0.11 to 3.0 and give them a little heads up about the interface changes they are going to see in 3.0
1067009474 [18898] <pam/#webco> i got a voice msg from dave c @ evergreen, anyone do anything with that report he sent in about slow downs?
1067010144 [18902] <pam/#webco> refusenik: is the fix for the saic hours error only temporary because it will really only be fixed by upgrade?
1067010147 [18904] <pam/#webco> bug #5151
1067011476 [18946] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do we need a reminder bug to set the times back for the instances we host on sunday?
1067011490 [18950] <pam/#webco> silly lcc guy thinks we dont have daylight savings
1067011632 [18956] <pam/#webco> hmm, smart computer, just checking
1067015340 [19098] <pam/#webco> refusenik: there doesnt appear to be any resources or schedule or icons when I log into regent
1067015394 [19108] <pam/#webco> ok, the icons came back in after refresh
1067015438 [19113] <pam/#webco> smacks refusenik and he likes it
1067017732 [19195] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i see the applet and resources but there is no schedule, not sure if there is supposed to be or not but it appears to have one prior to today
1067018016 [19203] <pam/#webco> yeah, on the schedulator you can tell that there is no schedule set for the checkout center so that data may be getting lost on the update
1067018103 [19207] <pam/#webco> i did see it but I don't remember anything from it, was it a problem with schedules?
1067018173 [19209] <pam/#webco> what does that have to do with the schedule?  they could not see resources
1067018625 [19218] <pam/#webco> hmm, well I guess we could just tell that in order to fix the error we had to wipe their scheudle and they need to go in and reset it
1067018661 [19224] <pam/#webco> sure, are the ready to to otherwise?
1067018680 [19228] <pam/#webco> ok, ill send off email

1067363837 [19712] <pam/#webco> refusenik: per your email about upgrading redhat, we will need to upgrade all client on versions prior to 2.0.12 in order to secure proper back up so maybe we should start there

1068495946 [24703] <pam/#webco> refusenik: nothing about upgrading them to 3.0.5, do you want me to schedule it?  when do you want to do it?
1068496065 [24709] <pam/#webco> i can try
1068496155 [24711] <pam/#webco> how long will you need to do upgrade from 3.0.2 to 3.0.5?

1068498116 [24841] <pam/#webco> talked to jeff, he said he will advise if some things seem slower than others and report back
1068501478 [24874] <pam/#webco> crappy blocker just surfaced
1068501512 [24876] <pam/#webco> the system just let me pick up a reservation with a resource on it that is currently checked out, resulting in some half reservation half checkout state
1068501530 [24880] <pam/#webco> is that known or new?
1068501555 [24888] <pam/#webco> yeah, check out ck133 contents tab
1068501572 [24890] <pam/#webco> resource m-17-dv
1068501632 [24896] <pam/#webco> si
1068501642 [24898] <pam/#webco> SE not dv
1068501679 [24900] <pam/#webco> if you look at the allocation in the find checkouts page it says it is Reservation: M-17-SE and under that Checked Out: all other resources
1068501962 [24911] <pam/#webco> no error, just says "reservation" instead of having a return checkbox
1068501968 [24913] <pam/#webco> did someone just return 133?
1068502023 [24919] <pam/#webco> np
1068502149 [24923] <pam/#webco> gracchus: are you taking care of this bug or do you want me to file?
1068502160 [24927] <pam/#webco> ok
1068502307 [24931] <pam/#webco> ok, filed #6527
1068503041 [24942] <pam/#webco> can you send quick email to respond to sarah pls?
1068576574 [25295] <pam/#webco> oy, is there any love we can give ithaca about speed?  they seem to be suffering
1068583779 [25535] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i think you can close that one, woot, cannot reproduce
1068586643 [25560] <pam/#webco> refusenik: beth from portland sent in a request today for the feasability of exporting their resource data, altering the resource id and re-importing, they want to resource id to now include the resource type, what are your thoughts on that?
1068586946 [25572] <pam/#webco> refusenik: how long do you think that will take, I wonder if it should be quoted and paid for altho I think it should be there already and is actually a bug
1068587255 [25582] <pam/#webco> refusenik: yes, it was pushed to 3.1.x
1068588410 [25607] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you ball park the up changes so dan can contact to quote pls?
1068588892 [25621] <pam/#webco> thanks cbl
1068588913 [25625] <pam/#webco> does description mean resource type name?
1068588931 [25632] <pam/#webco> but it could right?
1068591289 [25656] <pam/#webco> kreig: good cause its a stinker
1068654493 [25972] <pam/#webco> kreig: i could not reproduce 6527 yesterday, i thought cbl closed it
1068654895 [25978] <pam/#webco> no worries, i will certainly reopen if i see it again 
1068655725 [25982] <pam/#webco> kreig: 6469 gets in the way of testing several things on the other information tab, is it possible to update beta with the fix for it?
1068656298 [25994] <pam/#webco> gracchus: we need to talk about the fix you put in for 6440
1068656325 [25996] <pam/#webco> instead of reinstating the error that the user used to get you added the pink box with a lits of all the intervening allocation for a resource
1068656373 [26000] <pam/#webco> which is fine except when you have long orders, then you get A LOT of reservations on the page and it becomes a little difficult to find what you neeed
1068656443 [26004] <pam/#webco> anything wrong with handeling it the way we used but with a more descriptive error per bug 5243?
1068656500 [26008] <pam/#webco> i really liked the list of allocation at first but after viewing it on long allocations or long repeats, its too much visually I think
1068656537 [26012] <pam/#webco> maybe even if we listed the next one instead of all of them?
1068657053 [26035] <pam/#webco> ok, 6440 reopened
1068657580 [26045] <pam/#webco> do we have any way of working around the whole long orders print off the agreement form issue?
1068657749 [26061] <pam/#webco> chapman complaining that long orders print off the agreement form, i don't know, is that cropping?
1068657802 [26070] <pam/#webco> ok, thats what I thought
1068657966 [26080] <pam/#webco> yeah, i told them about accd enhancements and suggested the oh so nice staple work around and they will have to live with it I suppose
1068657991 [26084] <pam/#onshored> that's a nice welcome ;)
1068658039 [26088] <pam/#onshored> i meant gracchus to you, good timing
1068658197 [26097] <pam/#onshored> ahh, streetside, havn't been there for a while
1068658219 [26099] <pam/#webco> does evergreen do barcodeing?
1068658348 [26109] <pam/#webco> hm, i thought that was addressed already
1068658370 [26113] <pam/#webco> do you think the barcode field on the contents tab should accept barcodes and resource ids?
1068658393 [26117] <pam/#webco> ok, me file
1068658433 [26121] <pam/#webco> well, not as the add resource field but in the pickup state when you are swiping outgoing rrt ones
1068658441 [26123] <pam/#webco> still p1 crit?
1068658491 [26127] <pam/#webco> ok, p1 crit it is
1068658768 [26134] <pam/#webco> im starting to get optimistic about the state of beta....can I get an update?
1068662625 [26221] <pam/#webco> gracchus: sure, what do you need?
1068662645 [26225] <pam/#webco> ok
1068662652 [26227] <pam/#webco> did you see my last note on the bug?
1068662685 [26236] <pam/#webco> i am willing to go without it for this release but it should be worked in at some point
1068662831 [26244] <pam/#webco> me likey, i think with that text we may be able to get away without the extra error on the left, weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
1068662867 [26246] <pam/#webco> true test would be to do a repeat and then look at the last in the list 
1068662873 [26248] <pam/#webco> i'll try that and you can take a look
1068663020 [26254] <pam/#webco> looks good, there is a missing argument inthe error msg tho
1068663037 [26258] <pam/#webco> check out ck94, that is what it looks like with lots of reservations
1068663078 [26262] <pam/#webco> yes indeed
1068663249 [26274] <pam/#webco> ok, let me know when/if you want me to look again
1068663487 [26281] <pam/#webco> es goot
1068664674 [26292] <pam/#webco> kreig: ithaca is down, getting modwebapp unable to connect
1068664965 [26296] <pam/#webco> thanks
1068665625 [26304] <pam/#webco> new p1 crit 6539
1068666026 [26311] <pam/#webco> kreig: what is your opinion on bug 6389, one of dave's big compliants
1068666069 [26313] <pam/#webco> i acutally was thinking it was just mook problem but for the first time ever I just thought I was making a checkout when I ended up making a reservation
1068666230 [26320] <pam/#webco> that may help, there seems to be something in place in 3.1 that if you time it just so the system does not pick up your request to move to the reservation or checkout page, I think I would have to show it to you
1068666307 [26325] <pam/#webco> come and see for yourself
1068666346 [26329] <pam/#webco> ?
1068666495 [26337] <pam/#webco> right, that does not happen in 3.0, I tested
1068666543 [26346] <pam/#webco> I do think the different commit buttons is a good idea any way
1068668797 [26364] <pam/#webco> kreig: i think 6452 is a p1/crit, all users are used to just ignoring that setting and allowing the pickup grace period to take care of no shows, currently all allocation will remain open
1068668981 [26370] <pam/#webco> poop, set strike still not working correctly
1068669940 [26391] <pam/#webco> kreig: i love that you fixed 6452, you are my hero
1068670025 [26403] <pam/#webco> just a heads up that I am out of the office starting tomorrow through next tues, back wed
1068670110 [26417] <pam/#webco> i can now rest easy

1069440249 [30123] <pam/#webco> hehe
1069440309 [30126] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i just opened bug 6584 support action, can you take a look when you get back from lunch?
1069443183 [30147] <pam/#webco> refusenik: thanks, they don't need to be restarted right?
1069445104 [30159] <pam/#webco> refusenik: will the upgrade fix the error they are getting, I know they need it anyway but I don't want to mislead them
1069445710 [30167] <pam/#webco> ok, I try to schedule upgrade, how much time do you need to take them down for?
1069448519 [30182] <pam/#webco> ok
1069448525 [30184] <pam/#webco> do i need to file a bug to get beta fixed?
1069448802 [30188] <pam/#webco> refusenik: gordon was having network problems earlier today, can you try again now?
1069448853 [30190] <pam/#webco> gracchus: was that you saying yes to my question or responding to dag about something?
1069449358 [30192] <pam/#webco> oh ic, that is dag not gracchus
1069449509 [30195] <pam/#webco> ok, i opened blocker on 3.1 for beta maybe someone will actually answer me then
1069450395 [30203] <pam/#webco> refusenik: woo hoo, thx
1069450412 [30206] <pam/#webco> i am checking with them for good time to upgrade
1069450422 [30208] <pam/#webco> you saw my comment about trying to reach gordon again yes?
1069451580 [30216] <pam/#webco> refusenik rocks
1069452559 [30221] <pam/#webco> crap, I think i upgraded the wrong bugs priority

1069454733 [30245] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i did a quick look but it's not that some are missing, nothing comes up at all
1069454893 [30247] <pam/#webco> i did a searchin resources and they all say available under the id so they are circulating
1069455362 [30255] <pam/#webco> those are the two that frank reported
1069455370 [30257] <pam/#webco> i did not get a chance to check the other
1069455374 [30261] <pam/#webco> others
1069455437 [30265] <pam/#onshored> word
1069690602 [30331] <pam/#webco> concordia's 3.1 instance is down, getting java exception error, can someone get it back up pls?
1069691220 [30347] <pam/#webco> thanks
1069692694 [30382] <pam/#webco> kreig: i think concordia is having firewall problems with their 3.1 site, max can not see any resource types in the applet but I can see them just fine
1069692737 [30384] <pam/#webco> i am going to open a bug, what priority do you think that should be?
1069692891 [30393] <pam/#webco> don't know but can ask
1069696595 [30428] <pam/#webco> i can't commit any reservations or checkouts on beta, blocker opened
1069696710 [30430] <pam/#webco> refusenik: that email from max was coming in for you?  I think this is same issue as bug 6505
1069702129 [30494] <pam/#webco> can I get an update to beta so I can test circulation pls?
1069703435 [30502] <pam/#webco> is something burnin down on 2?

1069713769 [30665] <pam/#webco> can't we set up a server restart so ucb can get that fix without the upgrade happening?
1069713789 [30667] <pam/#webco> for 6551
1069785628 [30870] <pam/#webco> i hate the check boxes on renews, why are they even there?  its not like the user can select certain resources for renewal and leave other off, am I missing something here?
1069785769 [30878] <pam/#webco> what does that mean?  they really can't can they?
1069785867 [30884] <pam/#webco> so you could have an allocatio that is both late and not late?
1069785913 [30888] <pam/#webco> beta is down, getting java exception error now
1069788366 [30927] <pam/#webco> kreig: do you need to do something to get those errors to stop happening due to disk full problem, can't really test until that is resolved
1069866541 [31072] <pam/#webco> kreig: where can I find that speed problem survey?
1069866659 [31076] <pam/#webco> that would be lovely

1070474197 [32523] <pam/#webco> refusenik: yes, they sent me an inventory report but I am having trouble getting them to just give me fields in the to systems they are using
1070474211 [32528] <pam/#webco> i have two more meetings today and will know more after those
1070474243 [32533] <pam/#webco> the inventory report they gave me is in pretty good shape to explain what we need 
1070474261 [32537] <pam/#webco> i woulld really like to have it as soon as possible, just so I can be clear
1070474270 [32539] <pam/#webco> it is an excel doc, can you read?

1070480879 [32672] <pam/#webco> i love refusenik, he is my hero
1070480924 [32676] <pam/#webco> explaining the new process of resource import is sooooooooooo much easier than the previous, i could even explain it to the "i don't know anything about database" folks :))))
1070482260 [32682] <pam/#webco> 66.167.155.252
1070489139 [32728] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you think you can make those small changes to the templates and sample files of the resource import so Location = Checkout Center, Label = Resource ID, authorized = Authority required?
1070490336 [32746] <pam/#webco> poop

1070647766 [33368] <pam/#webco> they are not in production, if you would like to wait until craig returns on monday I think that would be fine.
1070649088 [33379] <pam/#webco> refusenik: msu does need the rtype on there
1070649173 [33383] <pam/#webco> i think so
1070650028 [33388] <pam/#webco> all of my order paywork and verifications from them have the case listed and no notice of back order so I am going to have to call them

1070899900 [33581] <pam/#webco> ok but we don't even really know what the problem is yet do we?
1070906168 [33646] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you check on ithaca, does seem to be responding, just hangs inthe browser
1070906386 [33652] <pam/#webco> yep, they had to go somewhere until their server arrives, we needed to get them installed
1070906708 [33664] <pam/#webco> ok, advised ellen we needed to bring them back up
1070907053 [33674] <pam/#webco> thanks
1070907430 [33680] <pam/#webco> yay!
1070908847 [33684] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am opening p1/blocker for ucb #6672 support action
1070908856 [33689] <pam/#webco> can't return a checkout for some reason
1070909293 [33697] <pam/#webco> i don't think beta has been updated for a while, can some one update it and I will do a little testing before I have to go?
1070909302 [33699] <pam/#webco> refusenik: yes
1070911544 [33703] <pam/#webco> ??
1070911687 [33709] <pam/#webco> didnt you do that?

1070911736 [33715] <pam/#webco> ok, gottta go, see you all on thursday
1071165296 [34742] <pam/#webco> hi hi
1071166565 [34783] <pam/#webco> yeah sure
1071168494 [34786] <pam/#webco> refusenik: back from lunch yet?
1071169919 [34791] <pam/#webco> refusenik or kreig back yet?
1071170025 [34795] <pam/#webco> gracchus: are you bored? you need something to do :)
1071170600 [34810] <pam/#webco> refusenik: is it possible to load the resource type file and view the hierarchy without the resource file?
1071170698 [34817] <pam/#webco> right, no problem with that.  If i foward csv file to support list can you load a file so I can take a look at it?
1071170823 [34823] <pam/#webco> oy
1071172489 [34828] <pam/#webco> kreig: are you looking into umich speed complaint?
1071172728 [34836] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1071172744 [34840] <pam/#webco> refusnenik: i just sent that file to support so when you have a chance to load it just let me know
1071173513 [34849] <pam/#webco> ok
1071173554 [34851] <pam/#webco> it's in my public folder called resourcetypeattempt3
1071174602 [34876] <pam/#webco> ok, i made one and it is in my public folder
1071175693 [34904] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i got the irc boot, if you typed anything to me past my stating I put an org file in my public folder I missed it
1071181045 [34980] <pam/#webco> refusenik: it seems like the field that represents Authorized? is coming in as a resource type
1071246348 [35104] <pam/#webco> are we in general release of 3.1 now?  we are moving ithaca to it?
1071246480 [35108] <pam/#webco> hmmm, kind of on the fence about it, what does kreig think about releasing to client who are not on the "really need 3.1 list"?
1071246517 [35112] <pam/#webco> well it makes me nervous but that is my nature
1071247489 [35134] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can we talk ucb for a moment?
1071247521 [35140] <pam/#webco> two items
1071247536 [35142] <pam/#webco> first, bug 6672
1071247552 [35146] <pam/#webco> this is the one where they got some unknown error when trying to return items
1071247567 [35149] <pam/#webco> you told richard the account code in the field was invalid and they should change it
1071247588 [35151] <pam/#webco> he emailed back that was no account code on that order
1071247595 [35155] <pam/#webco> i checked and the order is currently returned
1071247600 [35157] <pam/#webco> ok, just wanted to clarify
1071247639 [35165] <pam/#webco> another issue with that is that as a part of their customization work they should have gotten an error that specifically stated that the account code entered did not match
1071247663 [35167] <pam/#webco> i will try to find the old bug related to the same issue so you can read the history on it
1071247679 [35169] <pam/#webco> yes, probably still a bug
1071247692 [35171] <pam/#webco> but I will update and reassign to you if that is the case, ok?
1071247705 [35175] <pam/#webco> ok, next issue
1071247717 [35177] <pam/#webco> they are scheduled to have upgrade to 3.0.5 first thing monday morning
1071247727 [35181] <pam/#webco> there is an open support action bug that I don't know if you saw or not
1071247747 [35185] <pam/#webco> they have several customizations that always get screwed up when we do new releases to them it seems
1071247789 [35187] <pam/#webco> should be do test upgrade of their data today or should it not be a problem since they are going from 3.0.4 to 3.0.5?
1071247856 [35191] <pam/#webco> usually it is their custom patron classes
1071247872 [35197] <pam/#webco> don't know, just know there are usually problems
1071247891 [35200] <pam/#webco> probably migration
1071247950 [35204] <pam/#webco> ok, ill see what I can find
1071265164 [35297] <pam/#webco> i just did some simple speed comparisons and the new server seems to make a big difference
1071265587 [35303] <pam/#webco> around $500 
1071265636 [35305] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i researched the ucb bugs caused by upgrading and they were all migration issues so ill cross my fingers for monday morning :) just try not to forget to do it first thing, 9am our time 7am theirs
1071506837 [35394] <pam/#webco> i don't think beta has been updated in quite some time, can some get that and I can work in some testing today?
1071506925 [35400] <pam/#webco> thanks
1071507249 [35411] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1071507525 [35413] <pam/#webco> dammit ucb is of course getting errors after upgrade
1071507532 [35415] <pam/#webco> i am opening p1 blocker

1071517166 [35492] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i was a little confused by ellens msg, why would she want to run two?
1071517189 [35494] <pam/#webco> maybe she is confused that she is still getting 3.1
1071517272 [35498] <pam/#webco> ok
1071519103 [35510] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you take a look at the ucb bug when you get a chance, #6690?
1071520094 [35518] <pam/#webco> great, thanks
1071521054 [35525] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i don't know what you are referring to
1071521112 [35528] <pam/#webco> there is this page on the support site:  http://support.webcheckout.net/bugzilla.shtml
1071526820 [35611] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i tested on a different allocation other than the one airdri sent and I just got it to work but if you try it on the reservation she mentions, 21022, it does not work

1071597510 [36287] <pam/#webco> i can't recreate the ucb problem either
1071597644 [36289] <pam/#webco> refusenik: there was a support email from max asking about a certain machine they have that is running webco much slower than other machines, sent while I was out of town on the 8th, can you take a look and see if you have any advise for him?
1071597657 [36291] <pam/#webco> subject line: Win XP machine running WCO slow
1071597805 [36293] <pam/#webco> eric: alex from saic sent in a request to run the inventory report josh ran previously by tomorrow, I can re-open bug, is this a go from sales?
1071602634 [36342] <pam/#webco> refusenik:  in the accessories field for the new import, does it matter if multiple items are seperated by , or | or whatever?  i can't remember
1071606064 [36380] <pam/#webco> kreig: i reopened saic inventory report bug and assigned to you

1071683698 [36667] <pam/#webco> kreig: can you review the request from msu about changing the font size on the new full page agreement form when you get a chance
1071686332 [36707] <pam/#webco> aac server is being set up today, will we able to install webcheckout tomorrow for them?

1071686819 [36724] <pam/#webco> ok, just let me know
1071686926 [36729] <pam/#webco> also, jane asked if we will be setting up a testing instance and a production instance or just a production instance.  Is it feasable to set up both for them?  that was they can learn and play on one without effecting their stats on the production instance
1071687199 [36737] <pam/#webco> ok
1071688985 [36747] <pam/#webco> refusenik: from aac server spec:  OPERATING SYSTEM:  Red Hat Linux 2.1 Advanced Server, Customer Installed
1071688987 [36749] <pam/#webco> LX21NFI - [ 310-1261 420-0918 ]

1071689344 [36782] <pam/#webco> do we need to have a support action group hug?
1071689379 [36788] <pam/#webco> hehe
1071690151 [36825] <pam/#webco> kreig: you closed a bug that I filed with a write to file error because hm disk is full but did not correct the problem so I can not test because I keep hitting errors
1071690185 [36835] <pam/#webco> if you want to just get it when you get a chance and then let me know I will be happy to do some testing
1071690205 [36840] <pam/#webco> thx

1071693485 [36879] <pam/#webco> kreig: i am still getting that write to file error when I try to add an increment fee to beta, are you sure that is a full disk error?

1071702352 [36990] <pam/#webco> if you believe getting aac on 3.1 is the best plan then that is fine
1071702695 [36994] <pam/#webco> hm, beta is missing usage fee module
1071702710 [36996] <pam/#webco> kreig: do you want me to open a bug for that?

1071858853 [37653] <pam/#webco> thanks
1071858994 [37664] <pam/#webco> was that art of pizza?
1071859018 [37672] <pam/#webco> hehe
1071862084 [37729] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did they say how long at art of pizza?
1071869628 [37740] <pam/#webco> refusenik: are we installing aac today or do you want to do it Monday?
1072109031 [37806] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I assume you have contacted academy of art about not being able to reach their server?
1072109345 [37820] <pam/#webco> refusenik: thanks, a lot of these schools actually start their days at 8am
1072125207 [37875] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I have one of the departments at aac's resource import files and I am going to open a bug for you to import them
1072125416 [37881] <pam/#webco> oh my, acadame of art college
1072126928 [37905] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I am going to a docotor appointment.  I may be back in later depending on how long it goes
1072202654 [37976] <pam/#webco> refusenik: any luck completing the install for aac?
1072203088 [37984] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks, and aac = academy of art college, no assuming necessary, it is their name
1072203554 [37997] <pam/#webco> i was not 
1072212362 [38016] <pam/#webco> great, can you load the resource file that is filed as bug
1072212671 [38019] <pam/#webco> #6722
1072212884 [38026] <pam/#webco> im going to have to give the url to the people I am working with
1072212891 [38030] <pam/#webco> at the school
1072216469 [38048] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i think the problem with the column headers is that I started the introduction of the import with them before you and I had finalized what those header should be.  It will be better next time I am sure
1072216774 [38051] <pam/#webco> there are some issues with the import
1072216792 [38053] <pam/#webco> the resource id field has become both the resource id and the description field put together
1072216816 [38055] <pam/#webco> also, those pieces that named a container in the file list as containing themselves in the system
1072218045 [38061] <pam/#webco> ok, resource type/id bug filed
1072220796 [38085] <pam/#webco> refusenik: thanks for you help with aac today, I can not tell you enough how incredibly helpful the new resource import was to this process, you are my hero
1072221647 [38091] <pam/#webco> yay!
1072221653 [38093] <pam/#webco> ok, im out of here
1072221660 [38095] <pam/#webco> have a nice holiday!
1072715338 [38180] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i get this when I try to tunnel academyart
1072715341 [38182] <pam/#webco> The authenticity of host '12.25.217.160 (12.25.217.160)' can't be established.

1072715342 [38186] <pam/#webco> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
1072715401 [38192] <pam/#webco> ok
1072718601 [38207] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am going to be in a training session at 1130 for about an hour
1072731031 [38358] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you remember the name of the guy who set up the server at academyart?
1072731077 [38362] <pam/#webco> first or last name?
1072733258 [38389] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i didnt write it, i copied airdri, if you want more specific info you can ask me, its only vague if you don't use the system
1072733278 [38391] <pam/#webco> or regularly use the system I should say
1072733412 [38395] <pam/#webco> i just added it to the bug
1072734003 [38417] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I tried to reproduce that bug but could not get it fyi
1072735457 [38468] <pam/#webco> if you want to have direct deposit for the new payroll company on the 16th please bring a voided check to me tomorrow 
1072735571 [38476] <pam/#webco> oy
1072735574 [38478] <pam/#webco> your welcome
1072738743 [38492] <pam/#webco> eric has left already
1072807911 [38554] <pam/#webco> refusenik: are you around?
1072807916 [38556] <pam/#webco> i needem helpem
1072808600 [38562] <pam/#webco> i am on with evergreen and trying to do some training and wyatt ran a report but it finally ended so thanks anyway
1072813694 [38594] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you need some training?  im happy to go over some stuff with you if you like
1072813725 [38600] <pam/#webco> wanna give me about 15 min and then do it?
1072816024 [38613] <pam/#webco> refusenik: sure, you want to come up?
1072817686 [38629] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i closed the recent blocker opened as dup of old bug and reopened old bug as blocker for missing bar code of outgoing resource feature, bug #5099
1072817695 [38631] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok
1072819617 [38655] <pam/#webco> ok
1072819647 [38657] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i also just opened a bug to have the other department at academyart resourced files loaded so when you have some time....:)
1072820527 [38673] <pam/#webco> refusnenik: I updated 6727 after further testing on the new build of beta, there is still an issue but it is more defined now and only half of what I originally reported is fixed already
1072820803 [38679] <pam/#webco> yes, I would say it could drop down to a p2
1072820810 [38682] <pam/#webco> normal
1072894551 [38768] <pam/#webco> refusenik: academyart does not have the link to turn fines off and on on the policy pages
1072894603 [38770] <pam/#webco> im going to open a bug on that
1072895241 [38776] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you still want me to open bug on that?
1072895412 [38780] <pam/#webco> ok
1072895660 [38788] <pam/#webco> ok
1072895670 [38790] <pam/#webco> would that be support action?
1072895847 [38804] <pam/#webco> ok, i am going to mark as support action i guess
1072896886 [38807] <pam/#webco> we are officialy closed for the holiday in about 10 min
1072897491 [38811] <pam/#webco> ok, ive got to run, have a nice new years!
1073071293 [38951] <pam/#webco> refunsenk: it needs to be part of the pickup process so that means on the contents tab of any allocation in reservation state
1073071320 [38953] <pam/#webco> so a user can just pull up an order, go to the contents tab and start bar code scanning the equipment that is going out
1073071346 [38957] <pam/#webco> no that does not work
1073071351 [38959] <pam/#webco> it is not an edit, it is a pick up
1073071366 [38961] <pam/#webco> that is adding an extra step for no reason
1073071374 [38963] <pam/#webco> it was there before, where did it go?
1073080997 [38977] <pam/#webco> refusenik: are you back yet?
1073082900 [38981] <pam/#webco> what does that mean?
1073927658 [41765] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am going to academyart today for training for the next three days.  The resource files look good, can you load to the production instance for me?
1073928480 [41775] <pam/#webco> its not for training, it is so if they want to start setting up their production level policies and operators ect while I am out there, so it will need to be up, can we figure out why it is unreachable?
1073928687 [41781] <pam/#webco> have you tried to contact norman wong?
1073929228 [41809] <pam/#webco> craig!!! hi
1073929232 [41811] <pam/#webco> how is san fran?
1073929247 [41815] <pam/#webco> i leave today, out there tomorrow
1073929252 [41819] <pam/#webco> going ok?
1073929260 [41823] <pam/#webco> no surprises for me tomorrow?
1073929291 [41827] <pam/#webco> wikki?
1073929360 [41839] <pam/#webco> craig: when do you leave there?
1073929379 [41843] <pam/#webco> what time, I would like to talk to you before I go in there tomorrow
1073929386 [41845] <pam/#webco> i leave here at 5pm central
1073929406 [41851] <pam/#webco> ok, does your cell phone work out there?
1073929420 [41857] <pam/#webco> can i call when I get to airport?
1073929446 [41865] <pam/#webco> that is good but I may be gone by the time you do that so I will call too
1073929457 [41867] <pam/#webco> what is the number?
1073930255 [41889] <pam/#webco> kreig: don't worry, I already took care of the domains
1073930263 [41891] <pam/#webco> eric is playing bball
1073938685 [41953] <pam/#onshored> silly mac
1073938688 [41955] <pam/#onshored> hi guys
1073939283 [41965] <pam/#webco> ok, here i go to san fran, woot woot
1073939426 [41975] <pam/#webco> kreig: seems from dan that all is moving along well with psoft, ill call ya from the airport just to check in before i take off
1074285692 [1556] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i don't know any more than the report.  UCLA was a vangaurd for 3.1 for some time but they fell off the grid.  So they should probably get an update to the latest 3.1 code since they havn't really touched it in well over a month
1074288297 [1572] <pam/#webco> refusenik: when you are suggesting to frank to give clean install of 3.1 does that mean all setting will be lost along with ck data?  such as policy, operators etc?  maybe I am not understanding what you are saying
1074288412 [1579] <pam/#webco> oh, that makes much more sense, thanks
1074288524 [1581] <pam/#webco> pam needs a lot more sleep and a lot less webcheckout after long training days
1074288538 [1583] <pam/#onshored> howdy joshy!
1074289456 [1587] <pam/#webco> yay!!! that was a big annoying one - thanks
1074289623 [1590] <pam/#webco> i have big ol united healthcare provider directories, do any body want one of their very own or do you want me to hang on to them and you can access them when needed?
1074294792 [1653] <pam/#webco> going home
1074529406 [3099] <pam/#webco> good morning
1074532060 [3138] <pam/#webco> craig: we have never gotten mlk day off in the five years i have worked for onshore/d
1074541115 [3180] <pam/#webco> refusenik: where in the application are you talking aobut home location/location string?  is it on the other info tab on the checkout confirmation?
1074542172 [3189] <pam/#webco> holiday schedule has now been added to snip snap
1074542190 [3193] <pam/#webco> guess which holiday is not on the list?
1074542281 [3195] <pam/#webco> refusenik: well, home location can be used to associate a resource to a location and to create deliver to locations so on the confimration screen there is a section where you can drop down a box of pre-defined locations to schedule deliver or a Use Text Field option where you can just type in the deliver to (home) location, does that help?
1074542304 [3199] <pam/#webco> groung hog day
1074542308 [3201] <pam/#webco> ground
1074620795 [250] <pam/#onshored> we had a power outage this morning
1074620810 [258] <pam/#onshored> hehe
1074621123 [266] <pam/#webco> refusesnik: i tried to tunnel in academyart and it does not seem to be working, can you check if you can get to their server?
1074621942 [281] <pam/#webco> eek, evergreen just emailed that their ck#s are now starting with 1 again, that aint so good
1074621992 [283] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i don't get an error, i get the address and paste it into a browser but it just times out and says connection failure, I thought maybe their server was down
1074622088 [295] <pam/#webco> kreig: you need a bug opend for that?
1074622921 [343] <pam/#webco> kreig: ok on evergreen
1074622968 [350] <pam/#webco> kreig: when is the academyart integration scheduled to run?  I don't see any log in the system event log that it has run so I cant tell if its not running or if there is a bug that it is not listing in the log
1074623059 [358] <pam/#webco> ok, It looks to me like it is not running because there were a few issues that were supposed to get fixed on the next run that all look the same to me
1074627336 [410] <pam/#onshored> kreig and refusenik: have you guys gotten your new insurance cards in the mail?
1074627568 [414] <pam/#webco> kreig: i got bumped off of irc so if you gave an update on academyart i missed it, can you let me know what the status of their integration is when you figure it out pls
1074627784 [423] <pam/#webco> so it is not running nightly currently?
1074628019 [432] <pam/#webco> ok
1074628039 [436] <pam/#webco> should I let them now you are going to be working on it tonight or in the morning?
1074628444 [439] <pam/#onshored> refusenik: hmm, they were sent out on 1/7 and dan eric and I did get them, I will have to follow up on yours
1074628463 [444] <pam/#onshored> this is the address i have on your application:  2446 N. Albany Ave 60647, is correct?
1074628491 [451] <pam/#onshored> ok, ill try to find out what is up
1074628516 [455] <pam/#onshored> hm, not getting it?  maybe I can ask them to send a duplicate care here
1074631924 [473] <pam/#webco> ok, how about an email to support then so I don't waste my time
1074632168 [485] <pam/#webco> refusenik: fyi, i upgraded ucla support action to a blocker, if they can't see resources in the applet they can't schedule any reservations or checkouts
1074632259 [495] <pam/#webco> i didn't consider them vangaurd, they need it back up so they can get into production
1074632277 [499] <pam/#webco> i want to call chris dutton and see what is going on but i reviewed the bug first
1074632675 [503] <pam/#webco> great, thanks
1074636200 [568] <pam/#webco> refusenik: great, thanks
1074636272 [572] <pam/#webco> refusenik: resource types still not coming up in the applet for ucla
1074638059 [605] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you see my comment on ucla?
1074638935 [621] <pam/#webco> above, resources types still not coming up in applet
1074639514 [626] <pam/#webco> hm, let me try again
1074639651 [630] <pam/#webco> weird, i don't see them, eric is going to try
1074640064 [638] <pam/#webco> refusenik: sorry, it was my browser
1074646559 [694] <pam/#onshored> josh: still around?
1074701518 [758] <pam/#webco> sure
1074701614 [762] <pam/#webco> the ucb upgrade bug?  are you sure that is the right number?
1074702482 [768] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, the one item that she is having issue with is a resource that is NOT contained but is offline indefinitly.  It is showing up in the drill down but in red and if you select it the system tells you that piece is unavailable.
1074702550 [770] <pam/#webco> it really should not be viewable in the applet since it is not available for chekcout or reservation but the system is NOT allowing a reservation of a conained piece or of a piece that is offline, it is really a display issue and therefore a low priority bug, IMHO
1074702763 [772] <pam/#webco> i made notes to the bug for you
1074703119 [781] <pam/#webco> yay, are you going to run one or are we waiting until tonight?
1074703260 [785] <pam/#webco> great, thanks
1074703942 [787] <pam/#webco> i have gotten a couple of reports of unstable activity with loading the applet using Windows XP
1074703945 [789] <pam/#webco> :(
1074703956 [791] <pam/#webco> i hate those kind of bugs
1074704539 [805] <pam/#webco> do you want me to call her back?
1074705477 [818] <pam/#webco> refusenik: does ellen need a call back from me or did you explain that bug to her?
1074705881 [827] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, np, ill call ellen
1074707954 [862] <pam/#webco> kreig: there still seems to be a problem with academyart integration, all of the classes have 0 members
1074709876 [883] <pam/#webco> refusenik: on phone, sorry, yeah, just take a cell phone and all is good
1074710403 [889] <pam/#webco> ok, ill order, I don't think we have any more around
1074714776 [923] <pam/#webco> kreig: did you seem my comment earlier about there still being a problem with academyart integration, classes all have 0 members in them even thought Jane and Bob say that peoplesoft has enrollment data for this term, do you want a bug opened on that?
1074717164 [927] <pam/#webco> is kreig here?
1074718221 [933] <pam/#webco> can you pls advise on my comment above
1074721982 [960] <pam/#webco> kreig: i filed the academy art booog
1074722010 [964] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you tell me what kind of printer that is downstairs pls?
1074722828 [975] <pam/#webco> thanks
1074795195 [1175] <pam/#onshored> since we have a new insurance policy I can have a rep come in and explain the new coverage.  Is that something you guys think would be beneficial?
1074796368 [1189] <pam/#webco> kreig: is the fix for the academyart classes going to run tonight or it should have run last night?
1074800430 [1204] <pam/#onshored> holy crap is it cold in here
1074803821 [1218] <pam/#webco> kreig: i need some help understanding the sychronize interface, do you a min to help?
1074813287 [1725] <pam/#webco> refusenik: any opinion on the accd tool crib request?
1074815685 [1755] <pam/#webco> all are gone except for us chickens
1074875422 [1836] <pam/#webco> does anyone know why the following authorization failure would come up:  Joseph Barrus failed authorization check. Text was: You are not authorized to alter system session 
1074876479 [1844] <pam/#webco> base locations and users?  what would those be?

1074892813 [1966] <pam/#webco> filed #6779 for msu, prob more to come
1074894015 [2026] <pam/#webco> kreig: do we need to restart msu for that fix to be effective?
1074894194 [2039] <pam/#webco> kreig: I just tried another reservation and got the same behavior
1074894285 [2046] <pam/#webco> actually I got what looks to be a vaild ck# but still the no resources error
1074894302 [2050] <pam/#webco> if i try to look up the ck in find ck/res screen i get no results tho

1075145796 [2607] <pam/#webco> refusenik: there are 500 on the interface if you do a search for pending invoices, i just opened bug #6796
1075147108 [2628] <pam/#webco> what is an agent?  
1075147421 [2638] <pam/#webco> refusenik: then that is part of the bug then?  the agent being none?
1075147826 [2650] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i don't understand that stmt
1075148508 [2675] <pam/#webco> yeah, on the interface an agent is listed with the history of the invoice for the payment line item
1075152202 [2698] <pam/#onshored> refusenik: i saw a peter gabriel concert over the summer and he performed one of his songs spinning around in one of the zorbs!  it looks like a blast
1075155068 [2788] <pam/#webco> refusenik: accd would like the fines update as soon as possible, how long would they need to be down for?
1075155525 [2793] <pam/#webco> refusenik: accd seems to be hanging, i am in the instance but the status bar just hangs, can you check to see if there is something holding this up?
1075156512 [2831] <pam/#webco> refusenik: even tho the invoices for accd are status paid they are still causing the patron has outstanding fines override and coming up in the find for pending invoices, want a new bug opened?
1075225406 [3023] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you take a look at vongs email regarding printing and advise if the response from him give us any usable information to get printing working for academyart?
1075225618 [3028] <pam/#webco> oy

1075229556 [3104] <pam/#webco> refusenik: well I already told him two hours :)

1075238068 [3242] <pam/#webco> refusenik: seems to work just fine now, thanks
1075238175 [3246] <pam/#webco> thanks to all

1075239429 [3268] <pam/#webco> milestones
1075239949 [3278] <pam/#webco> what is saic testing 3.1 url so I can check out some of these bugs they have reported?
1075311773 [3410] <pam/#webco> refusenik: weird, i just sent him an email, did you talk to him?  They are not supposed to be able to create stations, or did we fix the printing issue for them?
1075311813 [3412] <pam/#webco> oh, is that c12?
1075312236 [3437] <pam/#webco> refusenik: well it seems you want me to walk rik through something I have never seen or done so its a little like blind leading the blind, i'm going to log in and play around with it and see if I have any questions, is this only on their instance or is it also on beta?
1075312375 [3443] <pam/#webco> ok, ill check it out

1075314098 [3477] <pam/#webco> refusenik: thanks
1075314109 [3481] <pam/#webco> wow, chapman is so slow, poor guys
1075314545 [3493] <pam/#webco> kreig: i am sure you have addressed this in the past but I don't know the answer to this question so I must ask again,  chapman is asking if there is any way we can get the print agreement form to start a new page when it runs out of room, the one sheet is better for them but it still prints off when they have very large orders
1075314715 [3514] <pam/#webco> sure
1075314738 [3516] <pam/#webco> thanks kreig
1075314951 [3518] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you do chapman upgrade to 3.1 Friday morning?
1075320827 [3529] <pam/#webco> ok, chapman upgrade set for friday morning, im opening bug
1075321281 [3535] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, i can check with rik and rick but i looked around on their instance and the field seems to be populates so maybe lee did this and never closed the bug?
1075321397 [3541] <pam/#webco> well now that I take a closer look the info coming looks like it is in an abbreviation of some kind
1075321415 [3543] <pam/#webco> like NS, ACA, 02
1075327233 [3563] <pam/#webco> saic reported error on hours tab that need some attention as soon as possible because they open up tomorrow and need to set their hours.  It is bug #6812
1075327323 [3569] <pam/#webco> there are about 16 open saic 3.1 bugs with no milestone.  a lot of them sound way off to be ligit, can some one give me the url to their 3.1 instance so I can take a look for myself?
1075328004 [3578] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you have to do anything or was it working for you?
1075328716 [3588] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you tell the last time saic 3.1 testing instance was updated?
1075328990 [3595] <pam/#webco> kreig: do you?
1075330212 [3617] <pam/#webco> kreig: can you tell when the saic instanct last had an update? there are lots of unmilestoned bugs from them but they seem kind of out there to be ligit
1075330466 [3624] <pam/#webco> no, their testing 3.1 instance, sorry I was not specific
1075330918 [3635] <pam/#webco> ok, do you want me to just 3.1 milestone them then?
1075331394 [3657] <pam/#webco> ok, 16 new buggers for you 
1075481194 [4022] <pam/#webco> craig: usc emailed support, can you let me know if they are back up or when they will be?
1075482589 [4028] <pam/#webco> ithaca has mod_webapp(warp) error
1075482590 [4030] <pam/#webco> Unable to connect (-2) to Host: 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) Port: 8007 
1075482597 [4032] <pam/#webco> kreig: can you kick it?
1075482610 [4034] <pam/#onshored> howdy josh!
1075485509 [4038] <pam/#webco> kreig: should the ip 128.125.183.119 resolve to usc still?
1075485526 [4041] <pam/#webco> they are having major issues beyond training over thre
1075486852 [4057] <pam/#webco> usc is so god damn slow
1075486858 [4059] <pam/#webco> i hate this
1075487651 [4063] <pam/#webco> resource type hierarchy opens up poorly now, me file annoying bug
1075488883 [4074] <pam/#webco> ok, filed 6818 for usc p1 crit
1075489738 [4116] <pam/#webco> york emailed that they cannot reach their server and their IT person is out, can we do anything for them?

1075501446 [4211] <pam/#webco> oh my, why cant he check anything out?
1075501456 [4220] <pam/#webco> ill test
1075501485 [4226] <pam/#webco> did you talk or he just left msg?
1075502813 [4244] <pam/#webco> clark is not down, he is saying that sometimes when you hit the commit button the system does not respond and they have had to reset and start over
1075502829 [4248] <pam/#webco> i am VERY skeptical of this 
1075502873 [4250] <pam/#webco> the reservation advance limit override warning does appear in the checkout but he has all operators configured to override that policy already so it is not affecting his workflow at all
1075502888 [4252] <pam/#webco> even tho he keeps calling it an error and not an override, oy
1075504943 [4264] <pam/#webco> waaaa, chapman is getting errors
1075505069 [4274] <pam/#webco> just forwarded to support
1075505173 [4284] <pam/#webco> kreig: he can't veiw that allocation
1075505178 [4286] <pam/#webco> ?
1075505191 [4290] <pam/#webco> i need to check it out, pls hold just one sec, sorry
1075505339 [4303] <pam/#webco> nope
1075505345 [4305] <pam/#webco> can't view at all
1075505351 [4307] <pam/#webco> oh, ok
1075505497 [4311] <pam/#webco> that should clear up that error?
1075505542 [4317] <pam/#webco> oh, sad
1075505576 [4319] <pam/#webco> it cant be viewed at all, not just from next allocation link
1075505589 [4321] <pam/#webco> do you want to take a look or just me file bug?
1075505785 [4335] <pam/#webco> sigh
1075505805 [4337] <pam/#webco> what should i tell him? not till monday?
1075505893 [4347] <pam/#webco> hehe
1075505969 [4357] <pam/#webco> kreig: you rock
1075505986 [4359] <pam/#webco> polka away
1075830924 [4852] <pam/#webco> mike trainer sent in an error to support yesterdya that no one responded to.  Does he need a response or did someone talk to him on the phone or what?
1075831010 [4858] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you call Penny yesterday about invoicing issue or do you want me to call her?
1075831120 [4864] <pam/#webco> ok
1075831244 [4868] <pam/#webco> ok
1075832483 [4871] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what is up with chapman?  do you need any testing help or anything?
1075832895 [4880] <pam/#webco> anything about that report where the ck# in the find checkouts didn't match the data on the patron record or resource record or something like that? from yesterday
1075833160 [4884] <pam/#webco> this report from yesterday: I am having a problem with Chapman CK # 4656, Ambar Colon-Caisano.  When I go to "find equipment" and look up Firewire HD #529 it tells me that it is checked out to CK - 4656.  But when I go to that CK number it does not list the firewire drive.  When I go to Ambars account and click on "Usage", it does not list that CK number.  Please help with this.  We have an enormous amount of equipment to check out today.
1075833363 [4886] <pam/#webco> was there any research or follow up to this?
1075835336 [4894] <pam/#webco> academyart is complaining about speed now too
1075837979 [4923] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i did some follow up on that chapman report, part of what pete reported is valid, part does not appear to be but there are some additional strange behavior I listed on the bug, #6827.  Can you review and decide if that is a support action or 3.1 milestone please?
1075838932 [4929] <pam/#webco> refusenik: academyart is going to need your help to set up the printer in the other department than the one you did previously.  What do you need from them to get this accomplished?
1075839100 [4935] <pam/#webco> why won't they run it?
1075839130 [4939] <pam/#webco> well Kevin from the photo department emailed us and would like to set up a time to set it up
1075839194 [4947] <pam/#webco> that is 3.0.5 and it is support action, is that what you are asking?
1075839213 [4953] <pam/#webco> yes
1075839230 [4957] <pam/#webco> great, thanks
1075839243 [4959] <pam/#webco> do you want to coordinate with Kevin or do you want me to do it?
1075839870 [4966] <pam/#webco> ok
1075840212 [4968] <pam/#webco> refusenik: no love, got an error testing 
1075840213 [4970] <pam/#webco> #<WCO::WEBCHECKOUT {48117765}>: An error occurred during processing:

1075842583 [5038] <pam/#webco> kreig: do you need a bug to update academyart with the same speed improvements tonight?
1075843365 [5043] <pam/#webco> kreig: the view availalbe feature is moving very very slowly for chapman as well, will that be addressed at all with your wonderous work?

1075849905 [5105] <pam/#webco> kreig: this seems slower now?
1075850008 [5112] <pam/#webco> kreig: ck# issue resolved but it still removes all resources from the allocation when you confirm, gives reservation ck # and error, no resource or resource types availalbe
1075850123 [5115] <pam/#webco> refusenik: HP Color Laserjet
1075850329 [5130] <pam/#webco> refusenik: dont know
1075850348 [5133] <pam/#webco> looks like that would be it
1075850586 [5139] <pam/#webco> no, it does not have any numbers after it
1075851321 [5146] <pam/#webco> yay! mucho better

1075911704 [5266] <pam/#webco> good point
1075911729 [5268] <pam/#webco> is there some issue with the view-reservation screen coming up before the confirm, cause that is what I saw yesterday
1075911837 [5276] <pam/#webco> ok, i reproduced it yesterday so i will try again
1075912009 [5278] <pam/#webco> yep, certainly isnt happening with that reservation today, maybe the update to the system yesterday changed something?
1075912158 [5280] <pam/#webco> do we have the link where clients can get the sun java somewhere?
1075912359 [5286] <pam/#webco> THE support document :)

1075916708 [5364] <pam/#webco> Good morning.
1075916708 [5368] <pam/#webco> The checkout page of Webcheckout is not loading when I first sign in, only
1075916708 [5370] <pam/#webco> the icons at the top of the page and the line that says  "New checkout,
1075916708 [5374] <pam/#webco> current allocation" below the icons are loading.  If I click on the "current
1075916708 [5376] <pam/#webco> checkout" icon the checkout page appears but the resources do not load on
1075916710 [5378] <pam/#webco> the page.  Any suggestions on how to clear this up?
1075916841 [5387] <pam/#webco> if you say they should :)
1075916973 [5395] <pam/#webco> academyart
1075917020 [5399] <pam/#webco> ok, i would think they didn't boot it up until this morning but I will try that first.  Should I instruct him to install sun java as well?
1075917133 [5404] <pam/#webco> yes, so far
1075917348 [5412] <pam/#webco> its loading for me
1075917418 [5416] <pam/#webco> ok
1075917488 [5422] <pam/#webco> any word from chapman?
1075917518 [5424] <pam/#webco> andrei at academyart said he noticed a nice speed improvement! i love cragib ;)
1075921304 [5436] <pam/#webco> i was trying to test something at champan and they are not responding, can some one take a look? Browser just hangs, status bar starts and then just stops 1/4 of the way through
1075923108 [5440] <pam/#webco> kreig: seeing a problem with some changes you made yesterday while trying to do an edit
1075923169 [5444] <pam/#webco> i am editing reservation on chapman isntance and it loads the applet with all the resources but the status bar has the watch with the setting X as patron for allocation staying there and I can't seem to add a resource
1075923455 [5456] <pam/#webco> 4584
1075923476 [5458] <pam/#webco> ok, but it does seem to be haning the system up? the edit?

1075923757 [5479] <pam/#webco> Right now, 11:35 California time, we are experiencing a  problem on Workstation number 2 in the Goldroom  Klutz100 is logged on and is creating a reservation for client Mathias Stamm.  He has many items added to the list but they are all showing red and it stated that it is "checking availability".  The items are stingers, sandbags and flags.  It has been stuck on check availability for about 20 minutes.
1075923773 [5483] <pam/#webco> ok

1075926359 [5579] <pam/#webco> oy, more from chapman:
1075926360 [5583] <pam/#webco> Our printer situation is getting desperate.  The upgrade prints off the page like it did before you fixed it for us last semester.  Now it is overlapping words so that the agreement are unreadable.  Please send me a fax number and I will fax you an example.
1075926657 [5596] <pam/#webco> he is on the phone, i will get him when he is off
1075926937 [5606] <pam/#webco> ok, asking
1075927247 [5621] <pam/#webco> i know you guys are in the middle of stuff but when you have a chance do you think you can update beta so I can do some testing on the latest build?
1075927361 [5632] <pam/#webco> thanks refusenik
1075927846 [5640] <pam/#webco> thanks
1075928100 [5649] <pam/#webco> beta doesn't have rrt enabled i think
1075928331 [5653] <pam/#webco> thanks
1075928356 [5657] <pam/#webco> kreig: pete says agreement form is still overlapping words, do you want him to fax a copy or for me to open a bug?
1075928528 [5663] <pam/#webco> yes, single page now
1075929687 [5667] <pam/#webco> refusenik: beta still isnt' showing rrt module
1075930566 [5673] <pam/#webco> i am trying it, its not working, if i double click on rtype, it picks a resource for me, not proposed resource
1075931898 [5679] <pam/#webco> going into training session with evergreen
1075931904 [5681] <pam/#webco> sigh
1075932413 [5685] <pam/#webco> i can't get the applet to load on chapman Demille Hall, just says opening http://192.77.116.217/wco-chapman/classes/dist/circulator.jar in the browser status bar and nothing loads
1075932516 [5687] <pam/#webco> oh wow, it just loaded after like 3 min
1075932693 [5691] <pam/#webco> crap, trying to train evergreen and the applet is holding everything up with that same msg I saw a second ago on chapman
1076010676 [5846] <pam/#webco> kreig: remember what we said yesterday about smart ass comments?  ;)
1076010721 [5854] <pam/#webco> kreig, I know, but that adds a lot of time if edit running incredibly slow because of the rrt problems,  I bumped it because pete has asked about it three sep. times now
1076010751 [5857] <pam/#webco> yep
1076010825 [5864] <pam/#webco> and keep them in the confirmation screen, skipping the applet, which is lagging
1076010842 [5867] <pam/#webco> if you hit edit reservation is auto goes to applet
1076012103 [5873] <pam/#webco>  
1076012105 [5877] <pam/#webco> Is there a way you can give it a boost.  I would rather not lose the work I've done on it.  It is on Goldroom workstation #1 right now.
1076012112 [5880] <pam/#webco> can we help him with that at all?
1076012133 [5886] <pam/#webco> I am still waiting for the availabilty screen to load on this work order.
1076012133 [5888] <pam/#webco>  
1076012134 [5892] <pam/#webco> Is there a way you can give it a boost.  I would rather not lose the work I've done on it.  It is on Goldroom workstation #1 right now.

1076019675 [6094] <pam/#webco> damn, i spent the last hour working with Pete trying to figure out that unresolvable schedule thing caused by hot potato
1076019761 [6100] <pam/#webco> yeah i just saw that, I did not know that was caused by hot potato
1076019898 [6105] <pam/#webco> well I wish it was noticed before I spent an hour on it and the client was waiting for so long
1076019900 [6107] <pam/#webco> oy waht a day
1076020412 [6113] <pam/#webco> pete has requested that we uncancel a very large reservation that the Administrator cancelled yesterday.  is that possible?
1076021093 [6144] <pam/#webco> do you want me to test on a machine here?  I am sure they are pretty busy to be doing testing
1076083676 [6293] <pam/#webco> kreig: a couple more emails later last evening from chapman reporting more "unresolvable schedule" errors which you said were caused by hot potato, do they just need to restart their browsers again?
1076083856 [6304] <pam/#webco> do you want to read the email subject "to all" or want me to open a bug
1076083859 [6306] <pam/#webco> ok
1076088426 [6320] <pam/#webco> are there other things still going on on the ithaca server?  reported slowness for them

1076091549 [6355] <pam/#webco> gracchus mentioned yesterday that galios was running some other things that would have slowed them down, those things are not running there now?  sorry, i dont remember exactly what it was
1076091574 [6363] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1076093421 [6388] <pam/#webco> kreig: can you check if people soft integration is running nightly for academyart?  I cant find any record of it in system event log but maybe I am not looking correctly
1076094396 [6408] <pam/#webco> bug 6843
1076094402 [6410] <pam/#webco> for kreig
1076095780 [6430] <pam/#webco> kreig: chapman just sent in notice of the unresolvable schedule error coming up again, i am adding to the boog
1076096488 [6442] <pam/#webco> on phone with academyart, they are lagging really badly, can some one take a peak at their server and see if something is running, it just took about 30 seconds just to load the log in page
1076096607 [6448] <pam/#webco> now it is resonding much better
1076096691 [6460] <pam/#webco> i keep getting this when I am trying to load the applet, it happens intermittently and if I restart the browser it stops:  webcheckout.academyart.edu/wco-static/classes/dist/circualtor.jar, i have gotten it on all 3.1 clients at some point, does this make any sense?
1076096747 [6464] <pam/#webco> yes
1076096762 [6470] <pam/#webco> i cant coppy and paste from that in my browser so human error afoot

1076101750 [6543] <pam/#webco> well someone needs to don't they?  
1076101780 [6547] <pam/#webco> is it because we don't have the proper back up?

1076445857 [7471] <pam/#webco> kreig: is that email from jason with repeat reservation that is empty for you or is he just coming accross the repeat bug you just found?
1076446403 [7492] <pam/#webco> i don't know, i asked and got no response and I tested evey one and could see it without error
1076446445 [7498] <pam/#webco> where?
1076446553 [7507] <pam/#webco> this doesn't make sense.  evergreen has been using for a long long time and now it is unusable?  plus I did lots of testing as did dag
1076525110 [7727] <pam/#webco> chapman just emaied in they are very slow right now
1076525345 [7731] <pam/#webco> yeah, i logged in and I don't really see a lag either
1076525480 [7740] <pam/#webco> damn, why the hell do i have this job then!
1076525651 [7751] <pam/#webco> this better not be what I put off nirvana for
1076525729 [7761] <pam/#webco> i am sure i can be put to better use then
1076525789 [7765] <pam/#webco> i think i got gipped
1076526387 [7785] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i don't know if this matters for the test site for cstan but the ck#s are not correct, i created a res and it was CK-1
1076526819 [7796] <pam/#webco> 312
1076528429 [7812] <pam/#webco> refusenik: why is there no invoice icon on cstan?
1076528463 [7814] <pam/#webco> is that a module now?
1076529279 [7829] <pam/#webco> eric: they shouldn't have usage fee but invoicing for fines/damage etc is part of the base system so they will still need the Invoice icon
1076529992 [7849] <pam/#webco> kreig: ouchy report from chapman, can we help them with this at all?
1076529992 [7851] <pam/#webco> To all:
1076529993 [7853] <pam/#webco> Error message occured as I was creating a reservation for Patron: Sung
1076529993 [7855] <pam/#webco> Yong Son. It allowed me to commit it, but would not confirm the
1076529993 [7857] <pam/#webco> reservation due to "Error: Attempt to commit an unresolvable schedule."
1076529994 [7859] <pam/#webco> It has taken one and a half hours to get this far in the reservation. The
1076529995 [7863] <pam/#webco> reservation has 64 items in it and is open at workstation #3 in the
1076529997 [7865] <pam/#webco> Goldroom.
1076530338 [7871] <pam/#webco> so then, no we cant help them?
1076530378 [7873] <pam/#webco> is there some way to tell which item is not resolvable so they can at least not lose all their work?
1076530381 [7879] <pam/#webco> how?
1076530490 [7904] <pam/#webco> i don't think there is a way to tell "the" item, it does not say 
1076530504 [7909] <pam/#webco> that is not helping
1076530513 [7918] <pam/#webco> how do i know the OID?
1076530602 [7934] <pam/#webco> i have been reporting this bug for several days in a row and not once did I see a workaroudn suggestion from you
1076530958 [7955] <pam/#webco> i don't need you to call the client, I was asking for some assistance not to give it over to you
1076530966 [7958] <pam/#webco> i can call them
1076530971 [7960] <pam/#webco> i can't read kreig mind
1076531045 [7970] <pam/#webco> wishes she wasn't pissed off and could find the humor in that
1076531643 [7993] <pam/#webco> refusenik: chapman just sent in another email about speed, can you read and advise if you have any suggestions/comments?
1076532195 [8035] <pam/#webco> the email is from Pete, no mook
1076532382 [8037] <pam/#webco> pete has asked yet again about adding the add/find resource feature back to the contents tab, bug 6830
1076532394 [8039] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you think you could do that one?
1076532512 [8047] <pam/#webco> thats fine, as long as i can give him and its the next bug in line
1076532519 [8050] <pam/#webco> kind of thing
1076532755 [8053] <pam/#webco> it was already a P1 but I bumped it to a blocker so it is a higher priority
1076532937 [8057] <pam/#webco> chapman is not responding, something is holding them up
1076533739 [8069] <pam/#webco> you mean to shopping cart model?
1076533780 [8078] <pam/#webco> for making allocations? I don't think this works for them
1076533809 [8086] <pam/#webco> i know it is not a blocker, read the note and what i said in irc, change it back if bugs you that much
1076533958 [8098] <pam/#webco> having the system in shopping cart mode does not give the add/find resource field back to the contents tab
1076533975 [8101] <pam/#webco> so you suggest that evey time they want to do an edit someone changes to the shopping cart setting?
1076534007 [8103] <pam/#webco> or they add the step of always starting in the shopping cart and having to go back to the timeline schedule
1076534090 [8111] <pam/#webco> i call y0ou
1076535482 [8115] <pam/#webco> i asked them to previously but none showed up
1076535587 [8124] <pam/#webco> is there a new email on that? i think i missed it
1076535694 [8132] <pam/#webco> yeah, got that, thanks
1076535816 [8136] <pam/#webco> now academyart is moving very slowly, can we tell what is holding them up
1076535878 [8142] <pam/#webco> the is an edit invoice button on admin tab, will that reopen it allow you to remove the hold?
1076536017 [8144] <pam/#webco> actually i see a remove hold button on the admin tab
1076537029 [8170] <pam/#onshored> yay!
1076537200 [8184] <pam/#webco> ok, checkin it out
1076537434 [8194] <pam/#webco> refusenik: applying payment rec. works correctly but the reduce by option still adds the credit instead of subtract
1076537526 [8200] <pam/#webco> also, since you are working on credit you may want to pick up 6854 also
1076537577 [8204] <pam/#webco> ok
1076537763 [8209] <pam/#webco> anything i can help with?
1076538100 [8215] <pam/#webco> refusenik: the reduce by and pmt rec. seem to be working swell now
1076538120 [8221] <pam/#webco> the reduce to is still busted, different bug
1076538948 [8232] <pam/#webco> its in the add credit drop down, chg to reduce to and then same as others
1076539019 [8236] <pam/#webco> sweet
1076539947 [8247] <pam/#webco> refusenik: pls make sure accd also gets that patch for invoices
1076540083 [8251] <pam/#webco> great, thanks
1076607633 [8494] <pam/#webco> whats up
1076607686 [8508] <pam/#webco> ya sure
1076607805 [8527] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you update cstan and move to their server or are you still waiting their approval?
1076607848 [8533] <pam/#webco> yes, is that production?
1076607860 [8535] <pam/#webco> or just test site?
1076607883 [8539] <pam/#webco> ok, great
1076607891 [8541] <pam/#webco> ill see if i can reproduce
1076612677 [8608] <pam/#webco> got fax from chapman came in for overlapping wording on aggrement form, forwarding to support
1076614443 [8634] <pam/#webco> sure craig
1076616329 [8652] <pam/#webco> hm, rrt displaying the same resource twice on same allocation for suggested resource
1076618282 [8681] <pam/#webco> craig: filed 6865
1076618717 [8689] <pam/#webco> refusenik: finally able to weird behavior on the cstan 3.1 site, it seems it is only in once checkout center
1076618938 [8692] <pam/#webco> ok, finally reproduced cstan bug, upgraded to p1/blocker
1076623633 [8757] <pam/#webco> did someone help baylor? they look up to me
1076623688 [8765] <pam/#webco> never mind me read email
1076623784 [8769] <pam/#webco> crap, i always screw that up
1076624910 [8781] <pam/#webco> craig: can you check if academyart psoft is running? i can't find any log in system event for it
1076624960 [8787] <pam/#webco> sure
1076625064 [8789] <pam/#webco> refusenik: seems to work now, no error
1076626467 [8800] <pam/#webco> craig: are you there?
1076626658 [8805] <pam/#webco> bug 6751 is really causing much pain for academyart, double clicking rtype does not work to choose resource at random when rrt is not enabled
1076626664 [8807] <pam/#webco> can we move it up the food chain at all?
1076627174 [8817] <pam/#webco> they are doing reservations and they don't have rrt
1076627197 [8821] <pam/#webco> also, can you confirm peoplesoft is running, i don't see any log for it and they are still saying some folks are not in webco
1076627208 [8823] <pam/#webco> if you can, otherwise i must open bug
1076627323 [8831] <pam/#webco> ok
1076627448 [8837] <pam/#webco> ok, buggy opened
1076689730 [9014] <pam/#webco> its bug 6751
1076689752 [9019] <pam/#webco> i have not confirmed view available not working, it was reported late last night, i will confirm today
1076689774 [9023] <pam/#webco> the other issue is bug 6866 about psoft running or no?
1076689784 [9027] <pam/#webco> which is a p1/blocker currently
1076689860 [9029] <pam/#webco> for the other overall speed complaint of academyart, can we turn on profiling for them?
1076690143 [9033] <pam/#webco> hm, view available seems to work for me, I will confirm with Andrei and make sure he understands the functionality
1076690606 [9061] <pam/#webco> craig: bug number for the resource type issue is 6751
1076690675 [9066] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, i will do some additional testing and see if I can get it
1076690726 [9068] <pam/#webco> ok, just talked to andrei at academyart and asked him to call today if they exp. slowdowns, is ok to turn on profiling for them?
1076690781 [9070] <pam/#webco> craig: i don't understand your comment on 6866 fully.  Their creating a patron thro the interface caused and error with psoft?
1076690796 [9073] <pam/#webco> what exactly is a nono?
1076690935 [9094] <pam/#webco> don't be such a jerk craig
1076690976 [9100] <pam/#webco> i just wanted you to clairify because I have never seen an integration where there was problem creating a user through the interface
1076690992 [9103] <pam/#webco> if someone is not in the system and they need to add them to get their work done they need to addd
1076691003 [9105] <pam/#webco> if adding with the same id breaks the code I need to tell them not to do tha
1076691019 [9111] <pam/#webco> it is not intuituive that adding a patron with a user id would break the damn system
1076691026 [9115] <pam/#webco> fine
1076691031 [9117] <pam/#webco> then why would it be a nono?
1076691105 [9127] <pam/#webco> well that would be great if I knew that so they would know that, that is why I asked for clairification
1076691191 [9134] <pam/#webco> i can only try but if you sound a certain way......
1076691226 [9142] <pam/#webco> craig just wants to write his code, argh, pam, that is what is says, what part don't you understand, all comments with an edge of annoyance 
1076691264 [9145] <pam/#webco> if i am misreading you I apologize but that is what it looked like to me
1076691926 [9151] <pam/#webco> refusenik: have not been able to reproduce 6866 but I did find an even nastier one in the process
1076692646 [9159] <pam/#webco> sorry, i mean 6839
1076692854 [9167] <pam/#webco> craig: usc just emailed that studio D has lost all it reservations again, oy, I am going to add to the bug
1076693005 [9188] <pam/#webco> well I already reopened bug, i can close again if there is no need for it to be open
1076693483 [9197] <pam/#webco> craig: can I reply to usc that you ran the script again and all should be well now?
1076693543 [9202] <pam/#webco> ok, i see that now
1076695571 [9253] <pam/#webco> yes
1076695644 [9256] <pam/#webco> exactly
1076695737 [9260] <pam/#webco> craig: evergreen called, they have the one page agreement form again and they need 3 part.  Lyn said you had fixed once before for them but I do not see an existing bug for it.  I am opening bug
1076695766 [9268] <pam/#webco> refusenik: no, no msg, it does not appear that the rtype is exhausted, it just doesnt seem to work more than one time
1076695786 [9274] <pam/#webco> not according to what lyn just said to me
1076695794 [9276] <pam/#webco> ok, that would be great, do you need bug?
1076695875 [9284] <pam/#webco> great, thanks, supa-fast
1076695925 [9290] <pam/#webco> hehe
1076696018 [9294] <pam/#webco> evergreen also getting werid error i have never seen before Error:No instance key was supplied to get-object. using rrt
1076696039 [9300] <pam/#webco> i filed bug, i don't think it is blocking anything as far as I can tell but it is weird
1076696054 [9302] <pam/#webco> it makes the reservation and flips them into edit mode with that error
1076696077 [9306] <pam/#webco> if they hit cancel edit all seems normal so it is not blocker, i put it at major
1076699579 [9327] <pam/#webco> academyart is slow now, is profiling on?
1076699657 [9331] <pam/#webco> hm, andrei called to say they are slowing down but I don't really see a speed difference
1076701917 [9342] <pam/#webco> so does the silence mean that profiling is not turned on for academyart?
1076702453 [9352] <pam/#webco> is it possible to turn it on?
1076703238 [9363] <pam/#webco> who ever can, that is the fourth time i have typed that in today, if it is not possible then please say but any response would be better than none
1076703605 [9373] <pam/#webco> i already advised andrei that I would be sending over the questionaire today
1076704370 [9385] <pam/#webco> great!
1076705727 [9402] <pam/#webco> woot
1076705883 [9404] <pam/#webco> waaaahhhhh bad booog, so sad, items seem to be disappearing off of reservations, both chapman and academyart reported
1076706083 [9415] <pam/#webco> reset didn't seem to update it.  They had to go back and edit the items back on, I am still investigating, bug opened 6867
1076706175 [9422] <pam/#webco> the one at academyart was created on 2/6
1076706190 [9424] <pam/#webco> i have one report of one ck from each school
1076706200 [9428] <pam/#webco> don't know when evergreen one was created, will have to look it up
1076706221 [9432] <pam/#webco> you think this is the same issue that you worked out yesterday and maybe this won't continue?
1076706230 [9439] <pam/#webco> is it worked out or no?
1076706233 [9441] <pam/#webco> ok
1076706237 [9443] <pam/#webco> looking for evergreen
1076706263 [9449] <pam/#webco> pam smokes much crack, i mean chapman, not evergreen
1076706322 [9453] <pam/#webco> ok
1076706940 [9476] <pam/#webco> craig: i updated bug and downgraded from blocker until it looks like the rsn bug didnt get it
1076707848 [9487] <pam/#webco> oh, i thought he meant server time, I checked and their instance says it is after 2pm when it is  only after one pm
1076708015 [9491] <pam/#webco> refusenik: their server time is off.  It currently says 2:17pm when they are pacific time and therefore it is 1:30pm 
1076708030 [9493] <pam/#webco> is that our responsiblity to fix?
1076709487 [9539] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what is the admin pword for that?
1076709741 [9548] <pam/#webco> i figured that out, after I tried it of course
1076709798 [9552] <pam/#webco> ok, looks like 6751 is fixed, yay!  I did notice that the summary of an allocation on your instance only lists the resource ID and it should list both resource type and ID of resources on allocation
1076709821 [9554] <pam/#webco> is that a bug or just something weird on your dev instance?
1076709862 [9560] <pam/#webco> sits in silence
1076709871 [9562] <pam/#webco> ;)
1076710175 [9568] <pam/#webco> refusenik: would that be support action or 3.1 bug for something on cstan test site?
1076710629 [9578] <pam/#webco> isn't that no rtypes in the summary on the cstan test 3.1 instance?
1076710648 [9580] <pam/#webco> sorry, i thought your instance was working off the cstan test one
1076710660 [9582] <pam/#webco> silly
1076710686 [9586] <pam/#webco> starts resignation letter
1076710864 [9588] <pam/#webco> refusenik: academyart gets patchy for 6751?
1076955632 [9887] <pam/#webco> refusenik: cstan just emailed, getting java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused when trying to log in
1076955658 [9889] <pam/#webco> i don't have any of their new server info so I can't check it out, also, not in the list of clients if I try to tunnel
1076955673 [9893] <pam/#webco> altho, is their new instance even up?
1076955865 [9903] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1076955877 [9905] <pam/#webco> did move to their server complete yet?
1076956306 [9913] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you seem mail from msu, frank says he cant log in, im checking it out
1076963041 [10044] <pam/#webco> poopy new bug at chapman I think, allocation is getting created with NO checkout center so when they try to return is they are getting location can't be altered for existin allocation error
1076963114 [10051] <pam/#webco> ck 5043
1076963379 [10053] <pam/#webco> sorry, its ck5060
1076963582 [10061] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i did notice on the activity tab that it says: New checkout Unsaved Allocation for Kelly Lange.  I remember there being another bug that related to allocation being created in state "unsaved allocation"  i don't know if that helps or not
1076963743 [10070] <pam/#webco> ick
1076963781 [10074] <pam/#webco> refusenik: bugs 6668 and 6499 may be related but I am not sure
1076966243 [10088] <pam/#webco> oy
1076966711 [10090] <pam/#webco> why must chapman suffer so
1076967482 [10094] <pam/#webco> refusenik: gettin anywhere on the chapman p1/blocker? it is starting to cause problems cause they cant return orders and therefore send other orders for the same resources out
1076967602 [10098] <pam/#webco> k
1076967915 [10104] <pam/#webco> yes, absolutly! there are others they are starting to hit, is there someway to set them all or  do you have to do them one at a time?
1076967951 [10111] <pam/#webco> goldroom
1076968645 [10115] <pam/#webco> thanks, i advised them
1076968793 [10122] <pam/#webco> ok, what would you like me to do with them?
1076968878 [10127] <pam/#webco> sure thing
1076968906 [10131] <pam/#webco> ok
1076970770 [10139] <pam/#webco> refusenik: added data to bug, also new bug created, will it never end
1077041124 [10316] <pam/#webco> academyart test intance is getting Java.net.connectexception error, is that a quick fix or do I need to open a bug?  I have advised that this site will not be available indefinitley but they have one staff member who has not seen webcheckout yet that they would like to train b/f we take this instance down
1077041147 [10318] <pam/#webco> ignore me and my slow email reading
1077041204 [10324] <pam/#webco> no
1077041273 [10330] <pam/#webco> ok, i will invetigate eudora
1077041657 [10340] <pam/#webco> yeah, i dont think we need to be supporting to instances
1077041667 [10343] <pam/#webco> you can disagree if you think it is no big deal
1077043656 [10369] <pam/#webco> msu just sent email saying they are very happy with the applet speed improvements, woohoooooo, a positive comment from a client, i can't believe my eyes!
1077043700 [10371] <pam/#webco> it is, however, followed by a list of things that were set up for them in 3.0.5 that are now not there in 3.1......
1077043824 [10379] <pam/#webco> refusneik: is it possible for you to spend some time addressing msu concerns today? if not today can I get a timeframe to tell our friend frank, they seem simple enough issues
1077043868 [10383] <pam/#webco> hehehehehe better you than me ;)
1077044428 [10416] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, filed msu issues and prioritized p1/normals
1077044530 [10418] <pam/#webco> if we could get to them some time this week I think that would be good cause Frank won't stop calling and emailing until we do :)
1077046389 [10448] <pam/#webco> refusenik: msu just emailed that the lost resource type in the applet thing happened again, lookgin for bug
1077046531 [10463] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am not certain, they have been flirting with production for so long I am unsure what their current status is, if you need to take them down pls let me know
1077048325 [10493] <pam/#webco> refusenik: cstan is using their test instance?  do they need a spank down call or what?
1077049639 [10505] <pam/#webco> refusnik: ok to both accd and cstan 
1077051589 [10517] <pam/#webco> phew
1077058970 [10539] <pam/#webco> ok, leaving so I can go to the bank
1077121623 [10614] <pam/#webco> refusenik: does academyart need something?
1077121954 [10628] <pam/#webco> yes, i called him and we went over several items
1077121969 [10632] <pam/#webco> was is accd that called just now?  i thought it was academyart
1077121972 [10638] <pam/#webco> sure
1077122034 [10648] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I think your first stop whenever someone calls you about a support issue that has not been reported on or that you are not specifically working on you should throw over to me, you can even transfer the msg on the phone, i can show you how to do that
1077122083 [10654] <pam/#webco> you can show me how to tunnel, i can show you how to transfer msgs :)
1077125195 [10667] <pam/#webco> refusenik: cstan reporting that hitting print agreement form is printing multiple copies, up to 20!  Do you think that is that a webco bug or some printer configuration thing?
1077127114 [10705] <pam/#webco> ok, don't ask me to ask them questions and then send the email yourself cause now they get two :)
1077127230 [10707] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i thought the branch testing was going to use chapman data?
1077127458 [10717] <pam/#webco> ok, i have a blocker already, using rrt no worky, won't add resource, me file
1077127645 [10721] <pam/#webco> ok, heads up , I am testing branch and filing bugs against 3.1 milestone with BRANCH in the subject line
1077130170 [10769] <pam/#webco> academyart just called, they are exp. slow down right now if anyone wants to look at profiling
1077130261 [10771] <pam/#webco> is dag around and available for testing on the branch too?
1077130427 [10790] <pam/#webco> dag: yes, in the subject line so start all with BRANCH- subject
1077130825 [10804] <pam/#webco> must have lunchy
1077135655 [10840] <pam/#webco> beta is down, i need it to compare certain functions in the branch, does some one have time to bring it back up?
1077135841 [10846] <pam/#webco> is this a bug:  notice when printing ticket with no resource: Warning:Printing tickets without resources is not supported.
1077136222 [10860] <pam/#webco> no, i can't test on a production instance
1077136235 [10862] <pam/#webco> well i could use academyart test instance i think
1077136440 [10868] <pam/#webco> ok, i think it is fine to you academy art so no worries
1077137173 [10885] <pam/#webco> yes please
1077137680 [10893] <pam/#webco> refusenik: usc just emailed request for back up directories, can you answer that one?
1077137692 [10895] <pam/#webco> pls
1077137917 [10901] <pam/#webco> great
1077138132 [10906] <pam/#webco> thanks
1077138841 [10910] <pam/#webco> gracchus: this doesn't seem to have the applet images fixed
1077138967 [10916] <pam/#webco> is the font type and size in this test instance part of the code, this font makes it more difficult to visually separate items
1077138973 [10922] <pam/#webco> os x
1077139141 [10936] <pam/#webco> well the font of the branch is different from all other webcos I access, weird
1077139177 [10938] <pam/#webco> gracchus how do I tell it not to use cached jars?
1077139217 [10944] <pam/#webco> yeah, got that, I am looking at the java pluginsettings
1077139232 [10951] <pam/#webco> there is a cache tab 
1077139247 [10955] <pam/#webco> but it has location, size, jar compression
1077139286 [10960] <pam/#webco> it has an enable cacheing button that is checked
1077139342 [10966] <pam/#webco> ok
1077139425 [10970] <pam/#webco> yay, much better
1077139464 [10972] <pam/#webco> refusenik: cstan printing mystery solved
1077139467 [10974] <pam/#webco> mook error
1077139507 [10978] <pam/#webco> ok
1077139759 [10980] <pam/#webco> gracchus: soooo much better, now I will try to pound
1077144566 [11017] <pam/#webco> craig: i opened a bug for the class synch academyart issue
1077144916 [11040] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i have a simon harris on the phone, do you want the call?
1077144937 [11048] <pam/#webco> yes, shoudl I find out where he is from?
1077145132 [11055] <pam/#webco> oh, for the file drop?
1077145138 [11061] <pam/#webco> oh, server?
1077212445 [11150] <pam/#webco> ok
1077212451 [11152] <pam/#webco> did chapman get an update yesterday?
1077212468 [11155] <pam/#webco> they have some strange behavior that is actually a bug I found on the branch yesterday but I never saw in 3.1
1077212859 [11159] <pam/#webco> chapman has a badly screwed up reservation that is going to need some attention asap, I am opening p1/blocker, by whom and when can this get picked up?
1077213089 [11163] <pam/#webco> in process of filing, its long
1077213796 [11171] <pam/#webco> refusenik: gracchus is going to pick that one up, thanks
1077215356 [11179] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did beta update complete?
1077215922 [11189] <pam/#webco> ok
1077216311 [11191] <pam/#webco> academyart getting Java.net connection error, can someone restart
1077216400 [11199] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks, that is what andrei said he saw on his screen, i couldn't get anything to load
1077223966 [11253] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, will answer
1077225293 [11276] <pam/#webco> they are replacing the water heaters
1077227090 [11284] <pam/#webco> craig: i would like if I could ask you a few questions about academyart backup restore, can you please let me know when you have a few min so I can call you
1077227873 [11291] <pam/#webco> ok
1077230029 [11299] <pam/#webco> refusenik: just checking to make sure you saw petes email
1077295787 [11377] <pam/#webco> gracchus: when you have a chance can you come and look at the display of the beta on my computer.  It is very difficult to put my thoughts on it in a bug and I would like your opinion
1077299264 [11421] <pam/#webco> an operator moving equipment from one rtype to another would happen very infrequently
1077299281 [11423] <pam/#webco> i would think'
1077301940 [11429] <pam/#webco> refusnik: i was able to get one of the chap orders to pick up, it gave me an error at top that said Error:No instance key was supplied to get-object.
1077301945 [11431] <pam/#webco> Returning Checkout CK-5161(Go back to:FindCheckoutsandReservations)Ad
1077301951 [11433] <pam/#webco> but it did pick it up
1077301971 [11437] <pam/#webco> i thought you were working on that?
1077302030 [11447] <pam/#webco> ok
1077302054 [11449] <pam/#webco> gracchus: are you working on chapman still? If so, this new issue or still bug from yesterday?
1077302787 [11459] <pam/#webco> ok
1077304047 [11494] <pam/#webco> since the unresolvable schedule error currently does not identify the resource that is causing the problem, is it possible for someone to look at the three remaining orders on chap that are getting it and tell me what the resource is so I can investigate and try to get them to pick up?
1077304124 [11501] <pam/#webco> that would be so great
1077306201 [11508] <pam/#webco> refusenik: chapman cks, goldroom checkout center, 4533, 4366, 3473
1077306355 [11512] <pam/#webco> you mean pick them up?
1077306384 [11514] <pam/#webco> or put them in checkout state?
1077306428 [11516] <pam/#webco> i meant AND put them in checkout state
1077306577 [11520] <pam/#webco> trying to pickup reservation, so change it into a current checkout
1077306613 [11526] <pam/#webco> i would like to know the resource that is causing the problem if possible just so I can see if it leads to any clues as to what is causing the error, altho maybe you guys know already?
1077306631 [11529] <pam/#webco> yes, you can
1077308654 [11539] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you get those order to pick up?
1077309326 [11549] <pam/#webco> ok, advised
1077309684 [11557] <pam/#webco> ill make sure I mention that to pete the next time i talk to him
1077309954 [11563] <pam/#webco> feel the pain
1077310191 [11569] <pam/#webco> no, i did not get errors while trying to view allocation
1077310236 [11573] <pam/#webco> chapman just emailed they are obviously not able to work.  we need to get them running again, can you do anything?  we may have to schedule a time to do what we need to get those orders returned?
1077310306 [11577] <pam/#webco> i was getting error if I tried to return the orders, same as the report from pete, not just viewing allocation
1077310336 [11583] <pam/#webco> you can't stop the query?
1077310343 [11585] <pam/#webco> is it the query hanging them?
1077311767 [11622] <pam/#webco> ok, and you can't pick them up?
1077314770 [11650] <pam/#webco> Sandbag 1 - 99 - Sandbag #007 is currently checked out!
1077314837 [11652] <pam/#webco> and is not listed on 4533, i think, so weird
1077314949 [11656] <pam/#webco> the one about the new one that wont' pick up or did I miss one?
1077315005 [11660] <pam/#webco> no, i was working on that one, have not responded yet, will in one min
1077315834 [11669] <pam/#webco> i just got that for 5184
1077315867 [11675] <pam/#webco> what am I doing now?
1077315929 [11680] <pam/#webco> good call
1077315951 [11684] <pam/#webco> stinger #002 is not on this order
1077316508 [11692] <pam/#webco> york is hung up on a print command and their sysadmin can not log onto the server,can we interrupt it?
1077316522 [11696] <pam/#webco> thx
1077316830 [11706] <pam/#webco> ok
1077316908 [11709] <pam/#webco> after I got that error on ck5184 I went to Stinger resource type detail page and the four stingers that were the proposed resource on ck5184 say Checked Out in CK-5184 but the interface did not look like the pick up completed, more weirdness, in ten min when I can get the allocation back up I can tell you what it says now 
1077316967 [11713] <pam/#webco> nope, still a reservatio
1077317788 [11740] <pam/#webco> i guess its possible, i am trying to see what the resource detail page looks like but it take sooo long to do anything
1077320371 [11755] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i updated bug
1077553031 [11915] <pam/#webco> craig: ithaca time on thier server got set back an hour, can you get that or do you want a bug for it?
1077553201 [11929] <pam/#webco> no, ithaca is in new york, eastern time
1077554053 [11939] <pam/#webco> gracchus: hows it going on the chapman blocker 6838, I am sure pete will want an update if we have one
1077554304 [11947] <pam/#webco> hm, interesting, let me know if you think any further testing by me will help
1077562788 [12035] <pam/#webco> great thanks
1077562804 [12039] <pam/#webco> chapman on phone, they are hung up
1077562850 [12045] <pam/#webco> I have patrick on the phone, is there anything he can do when this happens?
1077562878 [12051] <pam/#webco> can I transfer patrick to you?  he says he can ping the box

1077579140 [12198] <pam/#onshored> as i suspected
1077579148 [12202] <pam/#onshored> oy
1077579246 [12223] <pam/#onshored> gordon can be very loud on the phone too
1077579622 [12237] <pam/#onshored> save it for poker!
1077579734 [12239] <pam/#onshored> time to go home, weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
1077648613 [12484] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok
1077658257 [12558] <pam/#webco> crap, i missed an email from usc, they lost the orders for stage E again, how to handle?  just open bug or what?
1077658481 [12570] <pam/#webco> ??
1077658688 [12578] <pam/#webco> ok, reopened p1/blocker support action
1077659110 [12592] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks, you closing bug?  
1077659116 [12594] <pam/#webco> gross
1077659138 [12600] <pam/#webco> but you did fix for the time being?
1077659144 [12606] <pam/#webco> ok
1077659219 [12613] <pam/#webco> staying open to figure out why it continues to happen?
1077659267 [12619] <pam/#webco> cool
1077665503 [12672] <pam/#webco> can this be diagnosed for chapman?  WCO always seems to slow to a crawl at this time of day.  Do you know any reason for this?
1077726421 [12705] <pam/#webco> craig: you working on academyart bugs today?
1077727105 [12712] <pam/#webco> ok, they have been waiting for quite some time for help on those so I will want to give them an update on the progress sometime this afternoon
1077730142 [12735] <pam/#webco> refusenik: support email came in from York requesting information about print server, can you respond to it please?
1077730223 [12739] <pam/#webco> thanks
1077731248 [12754] <pam/#webco> look, if their sysadmin is asking a question than they obviously need some assistance, are we just supposed to not respond if we can help them?  or we charge them $10 for the 15 min?  the whole "asking for the support contract" is not an acceptable work flow, it is just a pain in the butt, by the time anyone reviews a contract you could have answered the question, we need a better process for these things if the 15 min quesion answer is really a problem
1077731394 [12762] <pam/#webco> you think I don't know that?  but that does not mean that we can have no second level support at all, its not like I am inturrupting you 15 times a day, it may be once or twice a day
1077731420 [12767] <pam/#webco> i am tired of hearing the complaigning every time I have to ask for more assistance
1077732475 [12777] <pam/#webco> sorry for the short response, I am a little sesitive after the last couple of weeks, I will contain myself to crying fits in the back room
1077736734 [12820] <pam/#webco> ah, I will open bug for that 
1077736763 [12822] <pam/#webco> refusenik: the other academyart blocker bug still exists on your instance so no luck
1077737012 [12826] <pam/#webco> yeah!!!!!!!!!
1077738433 [12840] <pam/#webco> test before a patch is applied? sounds like crazy talk to me
1077739110 [12844] <pam/#webco> calling
1077739113 [12846] <pam/#webco> on the phone actually
1077739293 [12852] <pam/#webco> no, something new and fun

1077740248 [12873] <pam/#webco> phew, i think it is user error
1077740253 [12877] <pam/#webco> crosses fingers

1077741654 [12914] <pam/#webco> thanks
1077742582 [12933] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1077743296 [97] <pam/#webco> is there cooking going on down there on 1st floor?
1077749280 [191] <pam/#testing> gracchus: can you advise if 6966 is supposed to fixed in the current build of branch pls
1077749988 [222] <pam/#webco> yes, i opened it, i didn't see one previously
1077750107 [230] <pam/#webco> yes, that was fixey

1077819714 [544] <pam/#webco> there is a guy at Chapman who gets the following error when he tries to log into webcoServlet thread failing with: Error in function IMHO::FIND-WM-IMPLEMENTATION: No implementation for method "process-form" on class #<Built-In-Class T {281C2075}><br>
1077819718 [546] <pam/#webco> any ideas?
1077819976 [554] <pam/#webco> no, he gets it every time
1077819989 [557] <pam/#webco> closes browser, opens new window, error every time he says
1077820013 [563] <pam/#webco> Chapman has two blockers now, this one and another one on a specfic order
1077820021 [567] <pam/#webco> hm, don't know, I will ask him
1077820031 [572] <pam/#webco> you think maybe he book marked a session or something?
1077820078 [593] <pam/#webco> ok, will inquire, if you can, can you have a peek at 6995 when you get a chance
1077820092 [595] <pam/#webco> need bug to have a session timeout wording instead of the error
1077820101 [599] <pam/#webco> thanks
1077820271 [605] <pam/#webco> ok with me
1077821861 [626] <pam/#webco> http://vulcan.chapman.edu/wco/chapman/wvlvxpkubpycumhn/C364104/webcheckout-go?739:461
1077821870 [628] <pam/#webco> that has a session id, yes?
1077821970 [639] <pam/#webco> groovy
1077825857 [675] <pam/#webco> refusenik: how is it going with 6867? Chapman is now reporting the same blocking issue
1077829775 [767] <pam/#testing> is hm held up in something?  i am trying to look up chapman ck in branch
1077829788 [769] <pam/#testing> never mind 
1077830012 [799] <pam/#testing> gracchus: the orders I am looking for chapman are not on the hm version, they were orders placed on 1/8 and 2/6, shouldn't they be there?
1077830051 [812] <pam/#testing> 4357 and 4830
1077830067 [816] <pam/#testing> ok, thanks
1077830205 [822] <pam/#testing> hm, weird that it won't come up in the find checkouts/res
1077830607 [837] <pam/#testing> hm, what state is the allocation in?  I had all selected and it still did not come up
1077830666 [844] <pam/#testing> ok
1077831300 [865] <pam/#testing> oh for f()&()*& sake, I have been spending all this time and the search for checkout/res won't work if CK isn't typed in 
1077831546 [895] <pam/#testing> gracchus: as suspected the CK is not correct in the Branch either, please to do you magic and write code to find the remaining orders out there for Chapman that do not have everything on them they should?
1077834761 [980] <pam/#testing> i was on the branch, i don't know, I did the search over and over several different ways and did not come up unitl i entered ck, i will do some more testing and advise
1077835639 [1000] <pam/#testing> refusenik: i think the find checkout is actually a different bug than needing the ck, im filing
1077836682 [1010] <pam/#testing> i keep getting HTTP ERROR: 500 Internal Server Error
1077836682 [1012] <pam/#testing> RequestURI=//wco 
1077836709 [1014] <pam/#testing> its intermittent
1077837028 [1019] <pam/#testing> http://hm.onshored.com/beta/wco?sessionid=iwymxmcfrkyhzwpg&caller=contents&method=pickup-resource-for-rrt
1077897889 [1168] <pam/#webco> dan is out today and I am sure he wants his 2 cents, we could start with what I think and consult with him on Monday?
1077897915 [1174] <pam/#webco> ok, me want coffe and almond butter bagel and then we can talk
1077897932 [1178] <pam/#webco> mmmmm, almond butter
1077897941 [1182] <pam/#webco> yipee
1077897949 [1188] <pam/#webco> i will come down in a fe
1077897952 [1192] <pam/#webco> w
1077898959 [1198] <pam/#webco> hm, academyart needs help setting up a new printer they say, so since we are doing thier sysadmin this is our task?
1077899136 [1217] <pam/#webco> ok, can you pls reply to the email then so I know what is up
1077899233 [1226] <pam/#webco> hehe
1077901185 [1258] <pam/#webco> craig: ready for academyart talk?
1077901218 [1262] <pam/#webco> ok, down i go, and i have notes!
1077909283 [1293] <pam/#testing> yes, could be
1077909312 [1296] <pam/#testing> there is a potential work around which is why i did not put as blocker
1077909346 [1302] <pam/#testing> its ugly but you could do a reservation for the piece of equipment from the point of the return of the one you were trying to renew to the new return date
1077909376 [1306] <pam/#testing> could be very ugly on long order so it really could be a blocker
1077909378 [1308] <pam/#testing> oh
1077909388 [1314] <pam/#testing> oh, yes not understanding then
1077909537 [1322] <pam/#testing> ok, one at a time then.  bug 6827, I think how that problem happened was addressed by a differnt bug that craig fixed given that the report came in b/f craig applied the fix, i will look up that bug number for reference
1077909619 [1325] <pam/#testing> sufficient? meaning will that reproduce the error?
1077909692 [1331] <pam/#testing> i don't think so, i was not trying to remove anything when I got it the first time, just altered the return date, give me a sec to pull up that order and refresh my memory
1077909800 [1336] <pam/#testing> hm, well maybe since on the order there were items returned on 2/12 and I filed the bug on 2/16
1077909812 [1338] <pam/#testing> ah yes
1077909822 [1340] <pam/#testing> too many boogs swimming in my heaad
1077909876 [1342] <pam/#testing> altho this error did not come up every time a partial renew was done so hard to narrow down to just that recipe
1077909990 [1348] <pam/#testing> i was trying to do testing on renews yesterday or the day before but was blocked by error "cannot schedule" 
1077910002 [1352] <pam/#testing> not sure if that bug is closed yet
1077910098 [1356] <pam/#testing> i am trying to run through the moved bugs from 3.1 to branch and compare behaviors in paralel instances
1077910138 [1358] <pam/#webco> refusenik: kevin from academyart on phone asking about printer set up, any idea when that can be addressed?  no pressure, just want to tell him an est
1077910284 [1376] <pam/#webco> if I tell him Monday is that ok?
1077910305 [1382] <pam/#webco> that's fine with me, just want to give date
1077910395 [1391] <pam/#webco> ok, tues works better for them
1077910415 [1393] <pam/#webco> refusenik: he would like a specific time, so ok to do noon on Tuesday for set up?
1077910462 [1399] <pam/#webco> ok, ill try to remind you, you will have to call his line because he can't call out long distance from that office, ill make note for myself
1077911432 [1421] <pam/#testing> refusenik: i believe that 6827 is fixed with the fix from 6865
1077911564 [1423] <pam/#testing> I looked at current data on chapman on 3.1 head and the issue is resolved there and I have not seen that problem come up again since 6865
1077911673 [1427] <pam/#testing> no, there was an issue with cache OID of resources, I don't fully understand that, I am just a monkey after all, but maybe craig could look and advise if he thinks I am correct or if that bug was some other problem?
1077912317 [1442] <pam/#webco> my phone won't put calls into voicemail anymore, weird
1077912465 [1448] <pam/#webco> crap i think our voicemail is broken, wont pick up for refusenik either
1077912493 [1450] <pam/#webco> yeah, mine said that too
1077912511 [1454] <pam/#webco> im sure he'll love this one
1077912524 [1461] <pam/#webco> is he around?
1077912539 [1467] <pam/#webco> hehe
1077913393 [1490] <pam/#webco> not up here
1077913401 [1494] <pam/#webco> ok
1077914208 [1526] <pam/#testing> no but i got it for many others, renew, edit reservation etc
1077916553 [1545] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ithaca is down, getting mod webap, please to kick?
1077916642 [1551] <pam/#webco> thanks
1077917444 [1563] <pam/#webco> saic is down now too, play it again refusenik
1077921213 [1584] <pam/#webco> 5184
1077922150 [1589] <pam/#webco> did you look at that allocation?
1078157940 [1866] <pam/#testing> how up to date is the beta?
1078158095 [1870] <pam/#testing> great
1078162721 [1907] <pam/#testing> beta is moving very slowly, should I be concerned about this or is it just cause it is being worked on?
1078162771 [1909] <pam/#webco> gracchus: have you gotten anywhere on the code to identify any of academyart and chapmans allocations that are missing items?
1078164125 [1922] <pam/#webco> ok
1078164142 [1926] <pam/#webco> yes, but been a little slow
1078164165 [1928] <pam/#webco> seems faster now tho
1078168712 [1944] <pam/#testing> hm, I can't get subtypes in the applet at all, can someone else check if they can?
1078169187 [1959] <pam/#webco> craig: the email from evergreen with subject VDR050741
1078169301 [1961] <pam/#testing> oh, its only under some root types that no subtypes come up
1078169406 [1972] <pam/#webco> what eric just came down and talked to you about, evergreen reported error
1078169418 [1974] <pam/#webco> he asked me to irc you on it
1078169460 [1976] <pam/#testing> beta seems hung now
1078169512 [1978] <pam/#testing> oh there it goes
1078170006 [1992] <pam/#webco> it actually gave the error if you tried to add that resource to an allocation, you can view the resource detail screen but once you hit Add to Allocation, error
1078170364 [2005] <pam/#webco> is that what chapman is running?  will that give evergreen some of the bad problems chapman is exp.?
1078170686 [2025] <pam/#testing> seems that way
1078172210 [2044] <pam/#webco> craig: evergreen would perfer to have after close, so between 10:30pm and 9:30am central time
1078174112 [2060] <pam/#webco> refusenik: eric said he would call them
1078177941 [2074] <pam/#testing> is it possible to bring beta back up?
1078178535 [2079] <pam/#webco> craig: while waiting on response from academyart do you think you can look into the open msu issues?
1078181144 [2118] <pam/#testing> wonderful!
1078181147 [2120] <pam/#testing> still getting java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
1078181154 [2122] <pam/#testing> trying to log in
1078181405 [2124] <pam/#webco> have to go to the bank so checking out
1078248843 [2227] <pam/#webco> refusenik: this is your reminder to call Kevin at academyart at noon to set up their new printer.  phone 415.274.2237
1078248987 [2233] <pam/#webco> np
1078249016 [2238] <pam/#webco> refusenik: for bug 6867, did this fix the allocations with missing items or just identify them?
1078249251 [2243] <pam/#webco> yeah, but just wanted to make sure I understood it correctly
1078249311 [2247] <pam/#webco> oh, how can you tell?
1078249338 [2252] <pam/#webco> hehe, ok
1078249390 [2258] <pam/#webco> oh, the hit enter without entering pin part?
1078252669 [2290] <pam/#webco> refusenik: kevin just needs to understand this right?  please confirm you are setting up printers for him
1078252757 [2294] <pam/#webco> ok, kevin gets it now, phew
1078253221 [2296] <pam/#webco> do we have an answer for Jason at usc about what to do when getting "No instance key was supplied to get-object" error?
1078253680 [2302] <pam/#webco> ok craig, want me to tell him you are looking into it or are you doing that?
1078254388 [2313] <pam/#webco> i have to go let ameritech in my house so I need to cut out for a few, should be back within an hour
1078257938 [2338] <pam/#webco> i am back too
1078259186 [2342] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you check that number for Rik again pls, I am getting number disconnected
1078259244 [2354] <pam/#webco> hm
1078259281 [2362] <pam/#webco> yeah, i have that one but he is not there, i guess ill leave a msg
1078260023 [2366] <pam/#webco> ok, got rik
1078260676 [2368] <pam/#testing> I have seen the system process rrt pickup when using the drop down box a couple of differnt ways, both buggy, want one bug or two?
1078261309 [2372] <pam/#testing> ok, put on same blocker, 7039, seems to leave allocation in multiple states
1078261953 [2374] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i have larry from academyart asking about the printer config you did, can I transfer?
1078263145 [2387] <pam/#webco> we are not doing parallel production for chapman
1078263162 [2390] <pam/#webco> they are just going live with the branch
1078263806 [2411] <pam/#webco> patrick just sent in email stating they have parts for new server and suggested if we could load them up later tonight or in the morning they could test for a day before going live
1078263938 [2420] <pam/#webco> maybe so but there are a couple of blockers still, should those close out first?
1078264210 [2430] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you come upstairs pls?
1078265713 [2438] <pam/#webco> craig: greg from academyart just called me, will you be around for a call back to him in about 15 min?
1078266099 [2443] <pam/#webco> yep
1078266855 [2454] <pam/#webco> ok, pls to come up and we can call him
1078266885 [2463] <pam/#webco> ok
1078267893 [2468] <pam/#webco> craig: you don't need anything from greg except the ok to go ahead, right?
1078272927 [2504] <pam/#webco> eric talked to pete, they are willing to do parallel tomorrow
1078272930 [2506] <pam/#webco> chapman that is
1078273052 [2512] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you have a min before you go?
1078273919 [2514] <pam/#webco> gracchus: you going to be around for a few?
1078274915 [2518] <pam/#webco> i need to talk to you, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1078274965 [2520] <pam/#webco> i come down
1078275793 [2527] <pam/#webco> jes
1078275827 [2532] <pam/#webco> indeed
1078279158 [2536] <pam/#webco> gracchus: im heading out, ill stop by on my way
1078517317 [276] <pam/#webco> back
1078517444 [303] <pam/#webco> gracchus: chapaman printing has reverted again on code update to three part, can you get them the one again?
1078517477 [311] <pam/#webco> hehe, need nap now, i see that
1078517856 [333] <pam/#webco> ok, back to academyart :)
1078517873 [335] <pam/#webco> dan you're not allowed back in the country without a sale
1078517915 [344] <pam/#webco> have a good trip home
1078519662 [348] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i think the tunnel to chapman is closed, can you open for me pls?
1078520176 [355] <pam/#webco> refusenik: doesn't seem to be working
1078520254 [360] <pam/#webco> browser gave me a connection failure
1078520514 [371] <pam/#webco> ive never had to log into prep before 
1078520518 [373] <pam/#webco> to go to a tunnel you set up
1078520554 [377] <pam/#webco> this is what I have:http://prep.onshored.com:8084/wco/
1078520582 [381] <pam/#webco> ok
1078520761 [398] <pam/#webco> ok, I can do it
1078521383 [400] <pam/#webco> i hate internet explorer
1078521465 [402] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i get this when I try to tunnel
1078521465 [404] <pam/#webco> support@prep:~$ tunnel chapman
1078521465 [406] <pam/#webco> bash: 2: 80
1078521465 [408] <pam/#webco> support@prep:~$ 
1078521506 [410] <pam/#webco> crap i have to reboot
1078527272 [421] <pam/#webco> right, they can only use the old one
1078527509 [425] <pam/#webco> gracchus is gone for the day?
1078762476 [497] <pam/#webco> good morning
1078762559 [500] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what is the status of the academy art clean up?  Andrei has already called me today 
1078762804 [511] <pam/#webco> ok, is it possible to get a list of the orders that have the 127 not found items on them?  Are orders without those on there corrected?
1078762862 [519] <pam/#webco> ok, I would like to review the list before we try to map. I am not 100% convinced that the name changes are operator actions or maybe the system doing some differnt wacked out thing?
1078762870 [521] <pam/#webco> great, thank you so much
1078764960 [564] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i spoke to andrei at mpt academyart, he HAS been changing names of resource so this may not actually be another bug, yay, altho I reserve the right to take that back....
1078765007 [568] <pam/#webco> so, if we can correct the ones we can and give Andrei a list of the items and cks that were not corrected he is willing to go in and add them back through the interface
1078765490 [575] <pam/#webco> I do have that list, is there a list of failures due to a resource no longer being available?
1078765636 [588] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i thought that file had the missing resources, it also contains any that were unavilalbe but still in the system?
1078765678 [592] <pam/#webco> oh, that was not clear
1078765682 [596] <pam/#webco> ok then
1078765975 [603] <pam/#webco> ok, I would think there would be some failures because some resources were scheduled elsewhere, no?
1078766276 [613] <pam/#webco> ok, I shall show tht file to andrei and see if he can confirm those mappings 
1078767807 [617] <pam/#webco> refusenik: got a phone msg from max about them having trouble with one of their printers.  It appears that they can print once and then after that the queue dies and has to flushed and restarted, he left a detailed msg, he wants to know if we have some way of monitoring the printer
1078767846 [622] <pam/#webco> refusenik: andrei is adding the mappings for items that did not have a guess and some that are slightly off
1078768127 [634] <pam/#webco> ok, np
1078768163 [638] <pam/#webco> from max's msg it seems that steve has done some work on the print issue but it does not appear to be on their end?  can I forward the phone msg to you and then you can let me know what we should do?
1078770219 [649] <pam/#webco> chapman printing is reversed again, is there any way we can keep this from happening?
1078770231 [653] <pam/#webco> it is printing 3part, they need one
1078770363 [659] <pam/#webco> thanks
1078770591 [663] <pam/#webco> hehe, ok
1078771304 [667] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i have the file back from andrei, there are a few on here that did not get changed, I can look them up in the find resources 
1078771475 [669] <pam/#webco> file in my public folder, resourceID_Corrections
1078774458 [675] <pam/#webco> refusenik: pls let me know when the test instance of academy art is up with the corrections so I can take a looky see
1078776880 [680] <pam/#webco> bummer
1078779591 [869] <pam/#webco> i feel like I am drowning in support soup
1078779619 [871] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you see mail from max?
1078779760 [883] <pam/#webco> damn it, academyart is not printing again
1078779785 [893] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am checking the set up that is logged in the bug and I am sure I will be bugging you with questions
1078781337 [946] <pam/#webco> sorry, just edited within the format you sent it
1078781379 [954] <pam/#webco> that would be great, bug reopend - #6577
1078781408 [957] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i will get you a different file
1078781426 [961] <pam/#webco> i hope
1078783433 [972] <pam/#webco> refusenik: new file in my public folder, pls to try this one
1078783797 [984] <pam/#webco> refusenik: Photo printer ips have all changed from what is listed on the bug, hmmmm
1078783848 [989] <pam/#webco> should I change them to what is listed on the bug?
1078784394 [993] <pam/#webco> that confuses me, the ones on the bug aren't the real ones?
1078784426 [998] <pam/#webco> this is what I heard: if they have an ip configured, and you can wawawawawawaawaawawa
1078784737 [1013] <pam/#webco> when you say the mooks have changed the printer config you mean you think the operators are going in and re-entering ips or there is some configuration such as dhcp in place?
1078784865 [1018] <pam/#webco> maybe I should call vong and ask altho you would think he would have said that the printers were on dhcp
1078854577 [1120] <pam/#webco> howdy
1078854616 [1122] <pam/#webco> refusenik: is there a new file for me to look at for academyart?
1078855249 [1130] <pam/#webco> refuesnik: i just randomly looked at some from the list I have from last week and they all have been fixed on the test instance, I could cry from relief
1078855433 [1132] <pam/#webco> we need to chat about those items in checkout state as some point too.  I don't think we can just go in and add item to checkout cause we won't be able to tell if they made a substitution
1078855921 [1149] <pam/#webco> hm, i get file not found at that url, ill check my drop box
1078856441 [1162] <pam/#webco> refusenik: fixes look good, do we have a new file of those items that were unavailable?
1078856457 [1164] <pam/#webco> can we run the fix for their production instance?  will they be down or slowed down by it?
1078857068 [1172] <pam/#webco> yes, I mean a file with just the resources that could not be added back, so I can advise andrei which ones he needs to fix
1078858192 [1176] <pam/#webco> sweet
1078861423 [1184] <pam/#webco> yehaw
1078861697 [1197] <pam/#webco> refusenik: file is great, thank you so much
1078862030 [1211] <pam/#webco> no worries, file is fine as it
1078862031 [1213] <pam/#webco> is
1078862413 [1216] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok to take academyart down at 215
1078862949 [1228] <pam/#webco> the resource is VID-090 (#1) and it is on both ck2262 amd ck1532
1078863032 [1231] <pam/#webco> !
1078863175 [1239] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i get this trying the academyart test instance  HTTP ERROR: 404 /'wco' Not Found
1078863175 [1241] <pam/#webco> RequestURI=/'wco' 
1078863211 [1252] <pam/#webco> well it is listed on the cks but if you look at detail page for resource it only has 2262 listed on usage tab
1078863230 [1258] <pam/#webco> yes, it says redirecting to webcheckout in 5 seconds and then gives me that error
1078863272 [1266] <pam/#webco> ok, that works
1078863473 [1276] <pam/#webco> oh, ok, makes sense
1078863811 [1284] <pam/#webco> works now
1078863925 [1287] <pam/#webco> I don't get any subtypes in the applet when I select a root type
1078863941 [1289] <pam/#webco> oh there they go, that took a long time
1078864132 [1294] <pam/#webco> the wrong rtypes coming up in the applet is going to have to be fixed before we release to academyart, I am in MPT and the rtypes fro Photo are showing in the applet
1078864214 [1302] <pam/#webco> shoot, i knew that
1078864722 [1312] <pam/#webco> sure, in root: Audio/Visual  subtypes: Sutter, Taylor, Van Ness
1078864773 [1316] <pam/#webco> choosing by rtype outside of rrt bug is back, reopening
1078864999 [1322] <pam/#webco> ok
1078865675 [1325] <pam/#webco> crap, i think repeating reservations may need to be fixed before we can release to academyart
1078865939 [1333] <pam/#webco> geez
1078866258 [1336] <pam/#webco> gracchus: repeats seem to be working without rrt but has some interface issues remaining, want on same bug or different?
1078866699 [1338] <pam/#webco> refusenik: academyart on the phone now, any idea how much longer?
1078867296 [1340] <pam/#webco> refusenik: pls stop the fix process and run again tonight
1078867621 [1348] <pam/#webco> gracchus: no resource types are showing up in the applet now on aac beta, they were there before
1078868105 [1361] <pam/#webco> refusenik: those numbers are almost identical to the one run against the test instance so the fix seems to have completed?  the did not fix or partially fixed is off by one, the completely fixed is a match
1078868523 [1367] <pam/#webco> yeah, i don't see any difference
1078868675 [1375] <pam/#webco> ok, ill try reloading
1078868941 [1395] <pam/#webco> gracchus: ok, just give me the go ahead when ready
1078869010 [1402] <pam/#onshored> hey hey
1078869371 [1411] <pam/#onshored> damn!
1078870547 [1536] <pam/#webco> gracchus: ok, did you see my comments above about repeats?
1078870783 [1562] <pam/#webco> i would say fix the choose by resource type not working outside of rrt first and then repeats
1078870810 [1564] <pam/#webco> the repeats appear to be working without rrt except for a display bug, I am adding to existing but
1078870813 [1568] <pam/#webco> bug
1078871545 [1603] <pam/#webco> ok, closes
1078872234 [1625] <pam/#onshored> 4/11
1078872262 [1631] <pam/#onshored> yep
1078873479 [1642] <pam/#webco> not really, I told them we were testing and it would be as soon as possible and I would give them an update tomorrow
1078873516 [1645] <pam/#webco> not update the software but just update them on where we are
1078873610 [1649] <pam/#webco> hm hung up?
1078875129 [1672] <pam/#webco> beta.webcheckout.net?  I get Error:
1078875129 [1676] <pam/#webco> The requested server is not configured.
1078875187 [1678] <pam/#webco> oh no, hm/beta, ok
1078875257 [1680] <pam/#webco> resources aren't loading in beta, not testable :(
1078876099 [1687] <pam/#webco> ok, going home now
1078936187 [1747] <pam/#webco> utexas is having some media set up problems which would have been adams domain and then probably craig, so whats the opinion on how this is going to be handled now?
1078936227 [1749] <pam/#webco> also, sfsu called me last week wanting an update on their media configuration and import as well
1078938030 [1757] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you can alter the organization that an rtype is associated to but you can not  set it to none
1078938200 [1761] <pam/#webco> perfect
1078939152 [1766] <pam/#webco> gracchus: subtypes and resources are not showing up on beta, do you know that already?
1078940386 [1781] <pam/#webco> gracchus: sure, just let me know when you get an update ready and I will pound away
1078940702 [1784] <pam/#webco> hm, saic reporting slowness again
1078940739 [1786] <pam/#webco> refusenik: if you have a moment can you check the vacuum thing that you tried last week? maybe that is it again?
1078940804 [1794] <pam/#webco> oh ok
1078940920 [1798] <pam/#webco> in my pocket
1078940928 [1800] <pam/#webco> ordered, should be here soon
1078944341 [1824] <pam/#webco> angry letter from student at academyart, ouchy
1078944631 [1827] <pam/#webco> gracchus: where are we on the new build to beta?
1078949626 [1869] <pam/#webco> it may not be a blocker anymore since jesse fixed the circulation but it is certainly not an enh.  It is functionality that was there previously and is not there now, no feedback to the user about a failed action IS important, changing to p2/norm
1078949768 [1878] <pam/#webco> it's not good enough for real life workflow, if you look away for a moment or you are adding a lot at once, having an item disappear from that box will be missed, there needs to be a notice that what ever you requested is not avaialble
1078950265 [1897] <pam/#webco> can I get an update to beta with the fix to choose by resource type included?  I need to confirm that works before we give this to them first thing tomorrow
1078950346 [1902] <pam/#webco> thanks
1078950509 [1904] <pam/#webco> im havnt hit any major bugs so far, only dispaly stuff
1078950517 [1906] <pam/#webco> knocks on dan's head
1078950634 [1910] <pam/#webco> yes
1078950756 [1914] <pam/#webco> i get java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.onshored.wco.CirculationApplet.class instead of the applet at 1955
1078951180 [1930] <pam/#webco> ok, that is the url i tried but ill try it again
1078951219 [1934] <pam/#webco> same behavior, i can log in but instead of the applet I get that error in the middle of my screen
1078951990 [1951] <pam/#webco> refusenik: academyart needs to make some reservations today, can we run the fix damage allocations script one last time before we upgrade the tomorrow to correct any that end up damaged today?
1078952021 [1954] <pam/#webco> they are open until 1030pm tonight so it is probably not doable tonight, it would have to be in the morning b/f the upgrade
1078952054 [1960] <pam/#webco> no, 1230
1078952070 [1964] <pam/#webco> 1030 pacific imeant to say
1078952297 [1972] <pam/#webco> yes but it looks like rrt is on
1078952351 [1978] <pam/#webco> um
1078952358 [1980] <pam/#webco> ok
1078952935 [1984] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I can't comment since I don't have time to try to reproduce dave's lengthy recipe
1078953330 [1990] <pam/#webco> new water heaters are being installed so there will be some noise.  I am having them start on the third floor one first
1078953816 [1994] <pam/#webco> refusenik: so are you going to set up an event-queue for academyart? if so make 1am our time just to give them an extra window
1078954083 [2002] <pam/#webco> so if I see a minor migration bug should that be prioritized so it can get addressed near when we migrate data or is that easy to fix down the road after they have been on the branch?
1078954118 [2009] <pam/#webco> ok, I opened bug 7082 if you want to take a look see
1078954257 [2011] <pam/#webco> oh my goodness

1078956455 [2077] <pam/#webco> um, no
1078956610 [2081] <pam/#webco> add your disappointment to the list of why you want to fry up his spleen then

1078957573 [2101] <pam/#webco> preemptive support

1078957887 [2112] <pam/#webco> yes i can 
1078958767 [2142] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i reopened the blocker for edit as checkout, leaves alloction in two states
1078959547 [2161] <pam/#webco> yes, i called him, it was a browser cache setting problem
1078960832 [2217] <pam/#webco> gracchus: yeah, I would have to do another order but they never charge us for shipping so its no big deal
1078961164 [2233] <pam/#webco> gracchus would you mind sending email, that is the way I track my to dos
1078961615 [2273] <pam/#webco> ok, i must head out too, if anyone needs me before 1130am tomorrow pls call
1079027389 [2757] <pam/#onshored> can we get academyart the single page aggreement form?
1079027713 [2763] <pam/#onshored> no oops on that one, I think they have always had the three part but they really need the one part
1079029265 [2798] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i assume the mails keving is sending are for you, si?
1079029789 [2804] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i have simon from biola asking for you, do you want to take or have me take a msg?
1079029916 [2808] <pam/#webco> sorry, too late, he would like you to call him with the passwords at 562.903.6000 x5612
1079029934 [2814] <pam/#webco> oh, I tunneled there yesterday I thought
1079029946 [2816] <pam/#webco> its on our server then?
1079030354 [2826] <pam/#webco> weird
1079031003 [2841] <pam/#webco> did someone get back to saic with the inventory report from alex's email request this morning?
1079031780 [2847] <pam/#webco> refusenik: eric said he is willing to go with what ever jesse thinks is best for biola install
1079031794 [2849] <pam/#webco> gracchus: which version do you think we should put Biola on, 3.0.5 or new 3.1?
1079032042 [2880] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I am calling Biola to advise we are installing them today then
1079032138 [2886] <pam/#webco> refusenik: simon is doing some updates on the server right now, he will call us when he is ready
1079032196 [2897] <pam/#webco> shrugs
1079032463 [2907] <pam/#webco> i have heard nothing other than refusenik getting photo department logged in
1079034274 [2918] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i am testing the edit as checkout producing two states but can't repro it now, es goot
1079034928 [2931] <pam/#webco> what is the object class on the system event log?
1079035292 [2938] <pam/#webco> ok, checking
1079035919 [2949] <pam/#webco> refusenik: as far as I can tell biola has what they need, they should not have rrt turned on and I can't really see that because there are no resources, please confirm
1079036058 [2957] <pam/#webco> oops, one more thing, they purchased help desk and I don't see the find tickets serach on reports page
1079036485 [2971] <pam/#webco> ok, looks good now
1079036511 [2978] <pam/#onshored> that is so wrong
1079036582 [2980] <pam/#webco> ok, I can send email with those items.  I don't have any info on mail configuration but I can add some info on the first two, is just telling him to test mail configuration enough?
1079041251 [3132] <pam/#webco> what is up with academyart?
1079041374 [3136] <pam/#webco> eek
1079041451 [3138] <pam/#webco> can I look at ck?
1079041670 [3142] <pam/#webco> academyart is getting error on some operators, opened blocker #7103
1079044502 [3166] <pam/#webco> i was unsuccessful, I can try some more
1079044512 [3169] <pam/#webco> is that what caused that for andrei?
1079045095 [3182] <pam/#webco> yay!
1079045224 [3186] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i got the edit as checkout to happen again - it is related to adding by double clicking rtype to select resource with rrt turned off!
1079045247 [3188] <pam/#webco> updating bug
1079045975 [3196] <pam/#webco> i got it
1079049568 [3347] <pam/#webco> gracchus rocks
1079109802 [3487] <pam/#webco> artcenter logs have "/bin/cp /home/accd/patron.txt /var/lib/wco/instances/artcenter/filedrop/patrons/run.2004-03-12_01:04:49 && rm /home/accd/patron.txt" failed with exit code 1
1079109814 [3489] <pam/#webco> that means the whole integration run failed, yes?
1079110002 [3495] <pam/#webco> has that error since 2/3, it is on there end, they are not putting the file? or is it related to upgrade to 3.1?  they emailed today
1079110016 [3499] <pam/#webco> just would like to know how to respond to them
1079110143 [3504] <pam/#webco> thanks
1079110562 [3508] <pam/#webco> ok, are you responding to mail?
1079110582 [3512] <pam/#webco> just got off phone with andrei, things seem pretty good, he had a couple of things to report
1079110596 [3516] <pam/#webco> academyart is andrei
1079110670 [3520] <pam/#webco> says the timeline schedule doesn't always load a resources schedule and they have choosen an item that looks to be available and then they get error on commit, when they go back to timeline then the blue bar is there that shows the conflict, I will file that
1079110678 [3522] <pam/#webco> refusenik: thanks, Ill email them
1079110715 [3524] <pam/#webco> andrei also said a couple of times they would go to the applet and the resource types would not load, they had to close browser and re-open and they would come back
1079110949 [3537] <pam/#webco> refusenik: no I dont, I am not a saavy PC user so it would be better if you wrote it up for me, if you show me I will just forget it by the next time I need it
1079111011 [3541] <pam/#webco> do you think those two items are both releated to a java issue?
1079112863 [3558] <pam/#webco> ok, so they should have up to date data then, their original report looked like a patron was in the file but not in webco
1079113270 [3562] <pam/#webco> "976961","other","Stephen","Greer","Rhodes","2545 Elsinore St.","","Los

1079113278 [3571] <pam/#webco> I don't see him in the system
1079113436 [3575] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1079115395 [3595] <pam/#webco> mmmmmmmmmmmm
1079116770 [3609] <pam/#webco> academyart is hung, cansomeone check it out pls?
1079117002 [3617] <pam/#webco> thanks
1079117062 [3623] <pam/#webco> refusenik: still seems hung to me
1079117074 [3627] <pam/#webco> coming down for lamb after academyart is back :)
1079117099 [3633] <pam/#webco> ok, now they are back in business, bring on the lamb
1079121818 [3642] <pam/#webco> refusenik: saic is down, you got it?
1079123026 [3658] <pam/#webco> gracchus: do you think you can turn off the expiring function for chapman, IE, no grace period, every reservation is active until its due back time?
1079123620 [3684] <pam/#webco> how temporary?
1079123660 [3693] <pam/#webco> it only runs every 5 min so it won't always hit the exact time
1079123862 [3701] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what would turning off the event queue do exactly?
1079123878 [3703] <pam/#webco> damn it
1079123913 [3709] <pam/#webco> I wonder if they use autocirculate
1079124241 [3714] <pam/#webco> will it restart when we update them too?
1079127878 [3741] <pam/#webco> can you add that to the bug so it is in one place?
1079129956 [3750] <pam/#onshored> hey girl
1079130070 [3754] <pam/#onshored> how's your day going?
1079130080 [3758] <pam/#onshored> i am jealous you and gordon got to go for breakfast today
1079133185 [3798] <pam/#webco> ok, gots to gopick up some paint, see yall on monday
1079368148 [4111] <pam/#webco> do we still have an academyart test instance or its just usc now?
1079368869 [4169] <pam/#webco> academyart has a blocker
1079368872 [4171] <pam/#webco> filing
1079369346 [4203] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what do you suggest I tell frank since he is completely blocked from making or editing any reservations or checkouts?
1079369613 [4205] <pam/#webco> from what his email says it would be a blocker, I am trying to confirm
1079369969 [4211] <pam/#webco> i think frank is a dope
1079369980 [4215] <pam/#webco> I am not asking you to switch to anything
1079374947 [4356] <pam/#webco> academyart has a pretty bad blocker that they have called and emailed about today, can we get an estimate for working on it?
1079374976 [4358] <pam/#webco> bug 7117
1079375480 [4376] <pam/#webco> i was confused between instances, I think hours are ok
1079375610 [4387] <pam/#webco> express doesn't seem to have hours set on their production instance
1079376161 [4400] <pam/#webco> gracchus: any progress on the peoplesoft stuff for current release? academyart asking
1079376199 [4404] <pam/#webco> i can email him
1079376251 [4410] <pam/#webco> sure thing
1079376310 [4417] <pam/#webco> academyart has the class synch stuff too but it is VERY important that section of it does not get turned on yet
1079376482 [4424] <pam/#webco> well it will undo all the work they have done for this current term and force them to re-do it all again for the fourth time.  I want to wait until the new term to force them to do it again
1079376730 [4427] <pam/#webco> damn, frank tate on the phone
1079377900 [4449] <pam/#webco> I think the fact that the view avail window is showing todays date and not the one the order is on is part of the problem
1079377966 [4451] <pam/#webco> saic down again, oy
1079379330 [4475] <pam/#webco> ah
1079379351 [4477] <pam/#webco> do you want to address that email then?
1079380293 [4508] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am on with usc
1079381158 [4512] <pam/#webco> saic has a blocker that started after the restart we just did
1079381177 [4514] <pam/#webco> getting following error on pick ups and returns
1079381178 [4516] <pam/#webco> #<WCO::WEBCHECKOUT {48662FA5}>: An error occurred during processing:

1079381187 [4524] <pam/#webco> bug 7119
1079381216 [4528] <pam/#webco> gracchus: it's zemeckis 
1079381220 [4530] <pam/#webco> equipemnt
1079381226 [4534] <pam/#webco> refusenik: thanks
1079381233 [4536] <pam/#webco> yes
1079382708 [4593] <pam/#webco> artcenters integration does not appear to be running, there is no log in system event since friday, the day craigl made some adjustment to the integration
1079383374 [4602] <pam/#webco> refusenik: so I should send that to them like that? can you tell what is wrong with the entry?  It means nothing to me
1079383420 [4606] <pam/#webco> oh wait, has only 20 fields and we are expecting 21?
1079384073 [4674] <pam/#webco> wonderful, what was it?
1079384118 [4687] <pam/#webco> refusenik: accd integration spec does not list a set number of fields, I don't suppose you have some reference for how many fields are supposed to be in accd file drop?
1079384329 [4691] <pam/#webco> no its not
1079384338 [4693] <pam/#webco> but I think it has one extra field
1079384351 [4695] <pam/#webco> academic level field
1079384393 [4701] <pam/#webco> I don't know, you asked about a spec
1079384833 [4711] <pam/#webco> spec says:An new, optional column is added to person import files to allow the import file to populate the Academic Level property on people.
1079384834 [4714] <pam/#webco> The current specification for person import files may be found at http://support.webcheckout.net/wco/admin/sec.import.patrons.html.
1079384873 [4716] <pam/#webco> so my guess would be that after the customized one additional field there should be 21 total
1079385737 [4736] <pam/#webco> refusenik: email from bob sloan with list of patches he wants to install, pls to review
1079459658 [5042] <pam/#webco> and let me know what eric is talking about pls
1079459950 [5069] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did academyart get an update that would include your fix for the availalbe resources showing as unavailable?
1079460061 [5073] <pam/#webco> great
1079460753 [5078] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you did get lansing back up? i tried to tunnel but got some weirdness
1079460802 [5080] <pam/#webco> the address for the tunnel resolved to a page that said Worlds most exciting index page 
1079462183 [5089] <pam/#webco> refusenik: are those usc instance parallel for them or testing for us?
1079462206 [5095] <pam/#webco> eric is out right now
1079462253 [5100] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1079462277 [5104] <pam/#webco> beta on hm is down, can I get an update for some testing whenever you get a chance?
1079462515 [5114] <pam/#webco> that does not sound promising
1079463919 [5131] <pam/#webco> i restarted my browser twice and then cleared the cache and reloaded, still don't see rtypes
1079464136 [5178] <pam/#webco> i still get no rtypes at 8086
1079464839 [5195] <pam/#webco> ok, I now see the rtypes, and it seems much faster than on their machine
1079466926 [5207] <pam/#webco> was able to confirm problem reported by academyart using demo, filed p1/crit 7124
1079468167 [5214] <pam/#webco> refusenik: when you get a moment can you review email from mike bay at quinnipiac and let me know if what he says makes any sense and if you just want me to file a bug or what
1079470576 [5255] <pam/#webco> refusenik: we are trying to do some testing on usc instance and when dan, eric and I all log in it takes us directly to zem center and doesn't give any of us the list of ccenters, none of us created stations
1079471505 [5295] <pam/#webco> for f()*&(* sake, chapman printing is back to the three page, pls make it the one page again
1079472154 [5314] <pam/#webco> refusenik: thanks
1079472221 [5318] <pam/#webco> eric: ok
1079472423 [5322] <pam/#webco> yes, I have asked a couple times i think, they really need single page so pls make it so
1079474937 [5342] <pam/#webco> refusenik: were you up here for me?  I am off the phone now
1079475871 [5376] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i don't have any idea what you are talking about :)
1079476071 [5378] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i can now see all the ccenters on usc instance
1079479554 [5397] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ucb is on the phone, they were having some trouble with freezes and sergio restarted and now they do not have the charge duration feature, can you take a look, should I file a bug, I am on with Airdri so if you could just advise a couse of action that would be great
1079479648 [5403] <pam/#webco> thanks
1079480172 [5412] <pam/#webco> sure
1079480497 [5418] <pam/#webco> just filed chapman bug that looks to me to be an interface issue
1079480536 [5425] <pam/#webco> yah
1079480559 [5427] <pam/#webco> I really can't find anything that leads me to believe it is deeper than an interface problem on the patron record
1079480574 [5431] <pam/#webco> ucb charge duration is back, thanks
1079480713 [5442] <pam/#webco> oh, that is my fav!!! pls drink boy, bring me a drink!
1079480889 [5450] <pam/#webco> thank you thank you thank you thank you
1079481176 [5458] <pam/#webco> everything is better when gin is added
1079540608 [5611] <pam/#webco> morning
1079541604 [5631] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you have stated it correctly, what happens when you try that formula?
1079541856 [5647] <pam/#webco> ok, so you can repro it, i don't remember if I dragged the timeline or typed in the return box on the applet
1079541901 [5649] <pam/#webco> actually, I think I removed the item first and THEN moved the timeline so it did not snap back
1079541942 [5653] <pam/#webco> either way the outcome is the same
1079542085 [5659] <pam/#webco> that sounds logical to me 
1079542764 [5662] <pam/#webco> is someone working on saic reports and 3.1 test instance? alex requesting an est. delivery, no pressure, just asking
1079545200 [5730] <pam/#webco> hm, weird report from usc that an items was added to an order during edit when hitting the commit button, did not require a confirm? I have never seen this before
1079545410 [5746] <pam/#webco> i am going to try to call the user and get more info, I don't entirely trust the formula that was reported
1079550402 [5868] <pam/#webco> hey eric
1079550596 [5876] <pam/#webco> eric: email from usc
1079550597 [5880] <pam/#webco> Entering an order is fine.  Editing it is troubling.  I changed the item (from room 111 to 118) and after COMMIT it did not ask for a confirmation nor did it actually drop the request for 111.  So now I have a reservation for 111 AND 118.
1079550597 [5884] <pam/#webco> Nick
1079550611 [5886] <pam/#webco> i asked for nick's number so he can walk me through what he did
1079550621 [5888] <pam/#webco> I can not reproduce currently
1079552673 [6030] <pam/#webco> refusenik: historically it has been an all or nothing deal for a created repeat rule.  Meaning if you get a conflict the allocation will not commit until that conflict is removed.
1079552698 [6032] <pam/#webco> that means that if you say every tuesday for a month and one of them has a conflict you have to remove the whole rule and put in new ones that work around the conflict
1079552721 [6034] <pam/#webco> or change resources, not a very easy process honestly
1079552742 [6042] <pam/#webco> silently skipping is bad bad bad bad bad
1079552778 [6048] <pam/#webco> i need to get a hold of nick first, I can't repro
1079552800 [6052] <pam/#webco> i have not even filed yet
1079552829 [6060] <pam/#webco> cries because she is only one person
1079552890 [6076] <pam/#webco> eric: not really that bad, just been busy
1079552929 [6086] <pam/#webco> no answer or vmail at mike trainer number
1079552932 [6088] <pam/#webco> weird
1079552951 [6092] <pam/#webco> not very easy is FAR better than bad bad bad 
1079552989 [6098] <pam/#webco> you have nothing better to do than correct spelling errors on irc ;)
1079553109 [6102] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i think "good" in making repeats may be a complicated process that requires an interface overhaul of the process itself, no time for those kind of shinanigans (pls correct that one!)
1079553170 [6106] <pam/#webco> ok, I can review with you if you like, there may be some un filed bugs still in that feedback
1079553306 [6111] <pam/#webco> refusenik: there are some notes on weird feedback of repeats filed in 7005
1079553736 [6131] <pam/#webco> if are not bar coding than the drop downs are a nec. piece of the rrt pie
1079554029 [6150] <pam/#webco> that is weird, I never noticed that in safari
1079554192 [6164] <pam/#webco> Eric-Chap do you have Mike Trainor's number on you, the one in clients just rings, I wonder if it is out dated
1079556176 [6229] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ellen thinks it IS her network now, so goodie for us
1079556640 [6244] <pam/#webco> eric-chap: how is the overall mood there?
1079556646 [6250] <pam/#webco> makes me smile too!
1079556692 [6254] <pam/#webco> it's a great step up from saic having a voodoo doll of adam
1079557227 [6301] <pam/#webco> eric-chap: i can test too
1079559138 [6355] <pam/#webco> refusenik: baylor is down, they restarted server adn can't get app up, can you take a look see?
1079559332 [6380] <pam/#webco> icky icky bug found by usc
1079559406 [6393] <pam/#webco> if you make edit to reservation adding one resource and removing another but leave the order without confirming the change it keeps the allocation is a strange state, I will file
1079559425 [6395] <pam/#webco> they claimed they could do it without getting a confirm button but I can't get that
1079559431 [6399] <pam/#webco> yes
1079559436 [6401] <pam/#webco> i got a hold of him
1079559511 [6405] <pam/#webco> hm, maybe not so icky, this is a weird one, gracchus do you have a min to come and see this?
1079560222 [6444] <pam/#webco> gracchus: usc bug filed, 7137
1079564623 [6737] <pam/#webco> nick at usc is reporting that he is not getting a confirm reservation button during edit and there do not appear to be any conflicts.  I have not been able to make that happen
1079565521 [6784] <pam/#webco> i just sent a screen shot from nick at usc to support, i can't open it, can any one else?
1079565909 [6803] <pam/#webco> gracchus: usc is getting that "you are unable to manage organizations" on the checkout screen, didn't that come up yesterday?
1079565916 [6805] <pam/#webco> for usc Ithink
1079565962 [6815] <pam/#webco> nick got it yesterday, waht that fixed?
1079565977 [6817] <pam/#webco> 's head swims in webcheckout soup
1079566443 [6870] <pam/#webco> ok, i have to go cook dinner for friends, stop me if you think you will need me longer, otherwise back tomorrow for more more more
1079566607 [6878] <pam/#webco> great, have a good night, enjoy the warm, it snowed here today
1079631968 [7609] <pam/#webco> hiya
1079632140 [7641] <pam/#webco> saic is asking again about status of test instance, oy, i say oy
1079632311 [7653] <pam/#onshored> josh: you don't love me, I feel neglected
1079632350 [7666] <pam/#webco> sunnyCal: do we have anything that needs my attention, testing?
1079632522 [7709] <pam/#onshored> that's feels like twisted dependant jerry springer kind of love
1079632832 [7766] <pam/#webco> refusenik: that is much better
1079633303 [7779] <pam/#webco> refusenik: committing it created a conflicting reservation.  I think that you should not be able to commit until all conflicts are resolved
1079633323 [7782] <pam/#webco> that is the current process
1079633710 [7786] <pam/#webco> ok, it seems that the work craig did on the aggreement form before he left has gone missing so that is probably that module?
1079634065 [7797] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I believe the work craig did was to complete some of their purchased enhancements to the form.  They are listed on bug 5791
1079634084 [7801] <pam/#webco> but of course there are no notes on the bug from craig outlining what he did or did not complete
1079634139 [7805] <pam/#webco> i have jason m on the phone from usc, he would like someone to shut down their production instances so they can run some tests on the testing instances, can do?  need to talk to him?
1079634214 [7811] <pam/#webco> gracchus: eric called me and said you were working on getting something up for testing speed, pls let me know when it is ready for testing
1079635895 [7830] <pam/#webco> jason calling back
1079635953 [7840] <pam/#webco> cool
1079635969 [7842] <pam/#webco> refusenik: pls call jason at 213.740.2898, one instance shut down but one did not
1079636866 [7858] <pam/#webco> ok, i am checking the speed of loading resources? anything else?
1079636920 [7866] <pam/#webco> gracchus: ok, that isnt' coming up for me
1079637040 [7875] <pam/#webco> good now
1079637421 [7885] <pam/#webco> um, no
1079637452 [7887] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i was creating reservation, added 5 sandbags by type and it is hung in checking avail
1079637501 [7891] <pam/#webco> yep
1079637617 [7897] <pam/#webco> ok, came back this time but got two false neg results
1079637792 [7903] <pam/#webco> ok, worked this time, nice
1079638021 [7907] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i clicked on a ck number from find resources and it taking a long time
1079638083 [7911] <pam/#webco> ok
1079638497 [7913] <pam/#webco> refusenik: does that error from ucb look familiar or should I ask alberto for more info?
1079638634 [7920] <pam/#webco> hm, the applet seemed to just freeze up on me
1079638869 [7930] <pam/#webco> i was editing reservation, it opened up subtypes of grip for me but then would not allow me to select a subtype or scroll down or select a resource.  I was able to commit and then go back to timeline and its working now, weird
1079638941 [7932] <pam/#webco> it seems to take a lot longer to check schedules in edit mode than in creation mode
1079639025 [7940] <pam/#webco> oh, ok, Im gonna stop for a few then, pls let me know when new build is ready
1079640064 [7951] <pam/#webco> sunnycal went to another department for a couple of hours
1079640121 [7953] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do I need to open a bug for accd print aggreement issues or did you load that module and like magic its all better
1079640374 [7957] <pam/#webco> oh, i must have missed that
1079640530 [7963] <pam/#webco> yay! you fixed it, lets go home now on a good note
1079641259 [7969] <pam/#webco> gracchus: good for more testing yet?
1079643446 [8035] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I think I need you to look at the ucb error, they are getting that error when trying to confirm or pick up and are therefore blocked
1079644221 [8099] <pam/#webco> ok, as soon as you get a chance or grow another head and two more hands will have to do
1079644723 [8114] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i got it to give me a false neg on an edit reservation
1079644945 [8135] <pam/#webco> ok, I just got the fourth email from ucb, I know chapman and usc are muy importante but ucb is completely blocked from doing any circulation
1079645041 [8149] <pam/#webco> gracchus: they restarted their server on their own yesterday and have been having trouble ever since.
1079645089 [8153] <pam/#webco> they had a couple patches not loading which were addressed but now they are getting #<WCO::WEBCHECKOUT {48F74705}>: An error occurred during
1079645089 [8155] <pam/#webco> processing:
1079645089 [8157] <pam/#webco> Error in function PCL::|(FAST-METHOD NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD (T))|:

1079645091 [8163] <pam/#webco> when called with arguments (NIL).
1079645100 [8165] <pam/#webco> when trying to do almost anything circulation related
1079645439 [8167] <pam/#webco> sunnycal: did you open a bug for getting false neg or should I open one?
1079645445 [8169] <pam/#webco> looked but couldn't find one
1079645711 [8179] <pam/#webco> i can have them check
1079645925 [8183] <pam/#webco> gracchus: thanks!  I will let you know if they are still having trouble
1079645968 [8188] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i just filed p1/blocker against the latest build with chapman data, #7144 for getting false intervening allocation error during edit
1079645981 [8194] <pam/#webco> I emailed ucb and will let you know if they are still getting error
1079647074 [8294] <pam/#webco> ucb emailed back with success, goodie
1079649185 [8385] <pam/#webco> any est for me to give saic?
1079649195 [8388] <pam/#webco> on test instance? should I just tell her end of the week?
1079649200 [8392] <pam/#webco> oops, thats tomorrow
1079649203 [8396] <pam/#webco> hehe
1079649321 [8400] <pam/#webco> hm, i don't get that

1079720405 [9262] <pam/#webco> eric: ok, will file
1079720965 [9319] <pam/#webco> i checked 10 random reservations made at academyart since 3.11 install and havn't found any damanged allocations!  since they were at about 80% damaged before I would say that is a very good sign
1079721058 [9325] <pam/#webco> woot
1079721081 [9330] <pam/#onshored> hi adam
1079721099 [9336] <pam/#onshored> our new york trip got cancelled :(
1079721114 [9338] <pam/#onshored> sad but not unhappy to miss the snow!
1079721534 [9351] <pam/#webco> eric: i had to make a doctor appointment for monday at 1145, be about an hour, I have get my hearing checked, lost some in my right ear
1079721608 [9359] <pam/#webco> is that left over from 3.1?  there was that thing where a couple of items ended up in the root type that shouldn't have been there
1079721626 [9364] <pam/#webco> eric: happened about a week ago
1079721658 [9366] <pam/#webco> I think I just need a supa dupa clean out
1079721727 [9372] <pam/#webco> eric: i don't think that is migration bug, I think it is left over from previous
1079721748 [9380] <pam/#webco> oh, good
1079721926 [9384] <pam/#onshored> hi joshy
1079721935 [9386] <pam/#onshored> how was your gigigy?
1079722324 [9404] <pam/#webco> where is the test instance for chapman?
1079722332 [9406] <pam/#webco> 9007?
1079722352 [9420] <pam/#webco> ok
1079722418 [9426] <pam/#webco> I can just look at where eric is
1079724786 [9519] <pam/#webco> umich is down like yesterday, refusenik, you got it?
1079726321 [9571] <pam/#webco> eric: sure
1079726551 [9577] <pam/#webco> eric: can you pls state file bug before something you want me to file so I can tell it from info you are giving developers?
1079726576 [9585] <pam/#webco> i have found it several times
1079726850 [9600] <pam/#webco> eric: filed
1079726860 [9602] <pam/#webco> I showed him where it was
1079727096 [9618] <pam/#webco> eric: ok, filed
1079727465 [9625] <pam/#webco> eric: did the reset do anything?
1079727479 [9627] <pam/#webco> the reset on the left field of the confirmation screen, should be the first button
1079727544 [9631] <pam/#webco> ok, do you mind if I take a poke around at it?
1079727625 [9636] <pam/#webco> that is where you are right?
1079727643 [9638] <pam/#webco> are you in the process of adding something to that order?
1079727678 [9642] <pam/#webco> ok
1079727750 [9646] <pam/#webco> ok
1079727943 [9661] <pam/#webco> eric: ick, order 4446 has the same resource on it twice
1079727975 [9667] <pam/#webco> oh no, that was my fault
1079728059 [9673] <pam/#webco> eric: is it ok if I swap out a resource of the same type on 4446 or does it have to be the ones listed?
1079728858 [9708] <pam/#webco> eric: there are several items on 4446 that are also reserved on other orders that overlap the times for 4446
1079729122 [9744] <pam/#webco> eric: this is so bad, there are items all over the place on two or more orders at the same time
1079729314 [9752] <pam/#webco> eric: i don't reallyknow what to say except I can add data to the bug and have jesse look first thing.  They have serveral orders to pick up today that have the same items on them chosen by rrt
1079729588 [9759] <pam/#webco> do you have a print out of what he took?
1079729803 [9763] <pam/#webco> I don't see any other option except to cancel and try to re-enter.  In theory the other intervening orders should swap out the resource it has with another one because they are all rrt, however, there may be a case where this has caused on over extention of a resource type
1079730034 [9765] <pam/#webco> ok, added all the sticky details to bug
1079730155 [9767] <pam/#webco> eric: wait, have you cancelled 4446? maybe one more thing to try before you do that
1079730377 [9772] <pam/#webco> hey gracchus
1079730395 [9774] <pam/#webco> pls review bug 7150 , seems ugly
1079730587 [9780] <pam/#webco> im trying to edit 4446 and I ask it to remove an item and it just seems to hang
1079730619 [9782] <pam/#webco> damn that took a long time
1079730723 [9787] <pam/#webco> can't really tell, still trying to work out this issue, havn't had chance to look around
1079730888 [9799] <pam/#webco> hm
1079730913 [9803] <pam/#webco> i am trying to edit 4666 so they can pick it up, should I stop until you can investigate?
1079730996 [9812] <pam/#webco> ok, pls let me know 
1079731011 [9817] <pam/#webco> when i can continue
1079731019 [9819] <pam/#webco> good, pls hold on
1079733590 [9898] <pam/#webco> where has eric gon
1079733592 [9902] <pam/#webco> e
1079733672 [9914] <pam/#webco> yes, i say go ahead and do it
1079734973 [9970] <pam/#webco> yep, already starting
1079735159 [9986] <pam/#webco> eric is on the phone with dan
1079735698 [9996] <pam/#webco> there are four items on ck5782 that are not available at the requested times, weird cause that should have blocked confirmation of the order
1079736006 [9998] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i have tried the reset thing and it doesn't seem to help ck 5782, there are four itmes that is says are unavailalbe for requested times
1079736397 [10016] <pam/#webco> eric: i am still working on 5782
1079736531 [10024] <pam/#webco> ok
1079737033 [10030] <pam/#webco> i think 5782 is related to the bug i filed on getting false neg. results.  There are four resources on there chosen by rrt that are not saying not avaialble but there are clearly at least one of each type avail at the requested times
1079737155 [10034] <pam/#webco> now saying
1079737480 [10037] <pam/#webco> eric: i fixed 5782
1079737508 [10042] <pam/#webco> i edit reservation, removed the four resource types it said were not available and changed pick up time to 3/19
1079737516 [10047] <pam/#webco> committed that change
1079737541 [10050] <pam/#webco> then edit reservation again and selected four resources by ID for the types I removed and committed again
1079737570 [10054] <pam/#webco> i do believe it is related to an open blocker and will add notes to the buggie
1079737610 [10056] <pam/#webco> oof
1079738414 [10075] <pam/#webco> i have din din plans so i am going to skate in about 10
1079738469 [10089] <pam/#webco> not unless you get me drunk
1079738542 [10091] <pam/#webco> hm, the find invoice button has some how been embedded in my browser
1079738670 [10097] <pam/#webco> i closed my browser and restarted and I still have the find invoice button in the main navigation of my browser
1079738679 [10100] <pam/#webco> that is so weird
1079738960 [10116] <pam/#webco> ok, have a good weekend
1079738997 [10121] <pam/#webco> sure thing, enjoy the golf!
1079972081 [10324] <pam/#webco> do we have a testing instances set up with usc data?
1079972200 [10330] <pam/#webco> just guessing we may need it at some point today
1079972269 [10335] <pam/#webco> what is csvs?
1079972289 [10340] <pam/#webco> ahhh
1079972297 [10342] <pam/#webco> sure, ill take a look, what am I looking for?
1079972903 [10355] <pam/#webco> hm, i get bug 7178 does not exist
1079972939 [10357] <pam/#webco> reminder that I have to go to the doctor at 1130, ill be gone about an hour or so I suspect
1079973258 [10361] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i don't have permission to access those files
1079973484 [10365] <pam/#webco> ok
1079973754 [10369] <pam/#webco> gracchus: what is the status of saic test instance, alex just emailed said their data is not there
1079973950 [10382] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1079974085 [10384] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I tested a couple of times in demille and I can make reservations, pick up and return and I do not get that error reported in 7158
1079974095 [10386] <pam/#webco> The files look normal to me
1079974116 [10388] <pam/#webco> the only thing i noticed was on the interface in the Find Resource Types search result there were a couple of duplicate resource types
1079974333 [10400] <pam/#webco> Rooms -- Viewing, Rooms -- Machine Rooms, Room -- Editing Suites are all listed twice, not sure but maybe user hit duplicate from the first one and didn't realize they made a copy?
1079974356 [10402] <pam/#webco> but I certainly do not get any errors when doing circulation in Demille
1079974372 [10408] <pam/#webco> sure
1079976964 [10434] <pam/#webco> ok, going to the doctor be back as soon as possible
1079982777 [10498] <pam/#webco> im back and I can hear!!!!!!
1079983011 [10503] <pam/#webco> sucked out the build up in my ears, gross
1079983021 [10507] <pam/#webco> the world is very very loud
1079983183 [10512] <pam/#webco> it was quick and easy and he takes our insurance
1079983235 [10514] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i can't remember if we ever moved cstan to their own server, do you remember?
1079983378 [10519] <pam/#webco> hm, one down side, dan is louder than ever :)
1079983705 [10525] <pam/#webco> did we give em one on their own server? so they have two maybe?  trying to figure out an email from them
1079983903 [10538] <pam/#webco> i will give him a call
1079984311 [10542] <pam/#webco> refusenik: does that error on cstan ring any bells?
1079984646 [10546] <pam/#webco> i can't recreate it
1079984795 [10550] <pam/#webco> ??
1079985188 [10557] <pam/#webco> i am on the phone with cstan, they are getting the error and I am not, weird weird weird
1079985297 [10563] <pam/#webco> doing that
1079985308 [10567] <pam/#webco> i am tunneled in
1079985466 [10570] <pam/#webco> ok, when i go to the ip address he is using i get the error, when I tunnel I don't
1079985511 [10576] <pam/#webco> 130.17.194.13
1079985578 [10580] <pam/#webco> yes
1079985595 [10584] <pam/#webco> I just did one on the ip address and I did not get the error this time
1079985599 [10586] <pam/#webco> yah
1079985602 [10588] <pam/#webco> probably
1079985620 [10590] <pam/#webco> seems intermittent
1079985643 [10595] <pam/#webco> I am going to open a blocker on it, can you take a look any time soon?
1079985663 [10597] <pam/#webco> they are ready to move over to their own server once this is resolved
1079985749 [10605] <pam/#webco> ok, bug 7165
1079985764 [10607] <pam/#webco> not as urgent as syracuse since they don't seem to be in full production, just getting there
1079986379 [10625] <pam/#webco> ok, i can try
1079986509 [10628] <pam/#webco> cstan seems hung up
1079986644 [10633] <pam/#webco> ok, waiting for system to repro then
1079987387 [10644] <pam/#webco> what kind of problems
1079987580 [10652] <pam/#webco> ok, can you correct so it doesn't store nil or do I need to instruct them to not set it to zero?  if that is how it got in that state to begin with
1079987655 [10656] <pam/#webco> k
1079990049 [10678] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, ill try
1079990130 [10680] <pam/#webco> ok, no error for me, I will email james and have him try
1079991109 [10685] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you just pick 3 days as a max checkout/reserve for them or was that set by them? i don't see anything out of the ordinary
1079991373 [10690] <pam/#webco> ok, it seems fine to me
1079991421 [10693] <pam/#webco> what happens if they type in 0 or clear the field cause they don't have a max checkout/reserve
1079992036 [10724] <pam/#webco> hey eric
1079992057 [10728] <pam/#webco> i tested demille circulation and I could not get that error to come up
1079992082 [10734] <pam/#webco> yes
1079992114 [10741] <pam/#webco> no, i was helping refusenik with it, I believe he was still looking into it, need an update from him
1079992134 [10744] <pam/#webco> they did have some rtypes listed twice for some reason
1079992280 [10765] <pam/#webco> i havn't heard anything from chapman tho
1079992291 [10769] <pam/#webco> don't know if they are just not reportingor what
1079992458 [10790] <pam/#webco> yes
1079992597 [10802] <pam/#webco> eric: did other items get returned without error, just the two listed caused problem?
1079992793 [10814] <pam/#webco> refusenik was working on that earlier but I am unsure if he was able to finish cause he got pulled into syracuse and cstan
1079992870 [10819] <pam/#webco> i did test rapid return on friday and it worked ok for me.  were all items giving that error or just the two listed on the bug?
1079992903 [10821] <pam/#webco> it was not usc data i was testing with tho
1079992916 [10827] <pam/#webco> ok, so it is random equipment?
1079993001 [10832] <pam/#webco> eric: are you on pec or usc instance?
1079993028 [10842] <pam/#webco> ok
1079993167 [10851] <pam/#webco> eric: do you know the ck number or resource id for that barcode?
1079993203 [10854] <pam/#webco> not finding a match searching for barcode
1079993245 [10858] <pam/#webco> tried that too, still no match
1079993266 [10860] <pam/#webco> need to try and find it another way
1079993335 [10866] <pam/#webco> shit, i typed in 0000000 into rapid return and it returned 80000000
1079993574 [10880] <pam/#webco> damn it, is there any way to fix that one that got removed?  I tried to add it back in with renew but I get an error that the resource is already a part of the allocation
1079993581 [10882] <pam/#webco> do we have a testing site for usc??
1079993729 [10892] <pam/#webco> Eric: i am not finding a match in find resources for 80002572, 80018683 or 80018689
1079993809 [10894] <pam/#webco> ok, those are all listed as resource ID and the barcode field is blank, maybe that is releated to the error?
1079993916 [10896] <pam/#webco> well I pasted the the id into the barcode and I still get the error, hmmmmm
1079994330 [10914] <pam/#webco> eric: still on it, I think i may have something, give me one min
1079994565 [10921] <pam/#webco> ok, 80002572 is on the contents tab of ck-43715 and says returned today at 1:54, however if you look at the resource detail screen for 80002572 it says the resource is currenlty overdue on ck43715, it appears this resource is stuck between returned and not returned
1079994597 [10923] <pam/#webco> upgrading bug to a big ole blocker
1079994820 [10931] <pam/#webco> thanks refusenik
1079994973 [10937] <pam/#webco> eric: you didn't list that one previously, does that give the same error?
1079994987 [10941] <pam/#webco> oh, yes, i see it
1079995119 [10943] <pam/#webco> when I look up 80000840 in find resources it says it is currently checked out in 43715
1079995126 [10945] <pam/#webco> hm, are all these items from 43715?
1079995130 [10947] <pam/#webco> checking
1079995156 [10949] <pam/#webco> nope
1079995193 [10953] <pam/#webco> 80001335 is listed as checked out on 43737
1079995246 [10955] <pam/#webco> is a developer checking on this yet?
1079995648 [10964] <pam/#webco> eric: it is not listed in the barcodes field, just in the resource id field, not sure why some are in just in id field and others in barcode and id field, both should work identical
1079995669 [10968] <pam/#webco> on find resources it is listed as checked out on 43737
1079995764 [10972] <pam/#webco> i don't think so, i added one to the barcode field and tried againg but still got error so i don't think it is releated
1079995836 [10976] <pam/#webco> 80014794 is in the same situation as the others, I dont think we need to continue to look all of them up, it seems the manifestation of the bug has been discovered.
1079996029 [10980] <pam/#webco> we need a developers opinion
1079996060 [10986] <pam/#webco> on phone with academyart who also has a problem now
1079996065 [10988] <pam/#webco> aaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrgh
1079996150 [10994] <pam/#webco> on phone, will fill you in as soon as possible, availability problem
1079996355 [11016] <pam/#webco> ok, academyart is reporting the USC problem, they have resources that are returned on an order if you look at ck but the resource detail is saying still checked out.  Blocking future checkouts
1079996397 [11024] <pam/#webco> 7167
1079996413 [11026] <pam/#webco> adding academyart to the bug
1079996540 [11030] <pam/#webco> yes, i did checkout, reservations, pickups and returns, no errors

1079997305 [11073] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, he is logging in and doing it again

1079997368 [11077] <pam/#webco> refusnenik: ok, error happened
1079997819 [11091] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, how to handle, want me to add to bug and you can move to that next or should I wait for you to clone yourself?
1079997852 [11099] <pam/#webco> ok, bug is filed, should you add what you got in the debugger to it?
1079997860 [11105] <pam/#webco> oh, damn

1079998616 [11145] <pam/#webco> yes, i imagine he will
1079998635 [11149] <pam/#webco> eric: i don't know, I tried serveral times several different ways and no error for me
1079998760 [11161] <pam/#webco> i don't know, i tunnel
1079998779 [11166] <pam/#webco> refusenik may have it

1080000323 [11210] <pam/#webco> oy
1080000327 [11214] <pam/#webco> he is trying again
1080000453 [11216] <pam/#webco> is chapman hung?
1080000462 [11218] <pam/#webco>  i want to scream
1080000496 [11226] <pam/#webco> i dont know if it is the debugger or what 
1080000516 [11231] <pam/#webco> but richard is trying to get to the log in page and it is has just been spinning for several minutes
1080000622 [11235] <pam/#webco> ok , he is in now
1080000784 [11246] <pam/#webco> ok, i must go now
1080064566 [11623] <pam/#webco> i am scared
1080064740 [11630] <pam/#webco> ok
1080064883 [11632] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you working on the demille problems, right?  John emailed in asking for an update
1080065159 [11638] <pam/#webco> that is what I wanted to clairfy, I logged on half way through the converstaion
1080065276 [11640] <pam/#webco> gracchus: any progress on saic data?
1080065366 [11657] <pam/#webco> email from alex?
1080065401 [11666] <pam/#webco> all I see is a turse email from alex
1080065457 [11672] <pam/#webco> so what is the status?
1080065937 [11686] <pam/#webco> ok
1080067063 [11707] <pam/#webco> refusenik: sure thing
1080067642 [11724] <pam/#webco> I think so, we def. need to contact them if we are going to take them down
1080067658 [11726] <pam/#webco> well they start circulating equipment at noon, they may be "open" before that
1080067677 [11730] <pam/#webco> yes
1080067700 [11734] <pam/#webco> they will probably be able to let us take them down, just need to get the ok
1080067707 [11736] <pam/#webco> sure, how long will they be down?
1080067794 [11740] <pam/#webco> ok
1080068216 [11749] <pam/#webco> refusenik: pete said ok if we do it in about 10 min.  If we wait any longer an hour will run into their busy time
1080068317 [11755] <pam/#webco> ok
1080069099 [11771] <pam/#webco> ok, what am I looking for in the interface?  What did it look like before the fix and how should it look now?
1080069228 [11779] <pam/#webco> damn it
1080069241 [11783] <pam/#webco> alex is on the phone and she wants to know what the story is with the saic instance
1080069306 [11794] <pam/#webco> i know, im getting really irritated, every day I tell her the end of the day and of course she is annoyed
1080069348 [11798] <pam/#webco> refusenik: that is true that they reported that symptom but I was unable to reproduce the error they were getting
1080069403 [11802] <pam/#webco> refusenik: so I can take a look and confirm that I am still not getting any errors
1080069451 [11804] <pam/#webco> gracchus: so should I tell her today? sorry to be pushy about it but she is on hold
1080069690 [11827] <pam/#webco> alex saying there is a plan to upgrade them wed night???
1080069709 [11831] <pam/#webco> eek
1080069717 [11833] <pam/#webco> she said she talked to eric about it
1080069854 [11839] <pam/#webco> refusenik: on with alex at saic, didn't even get a chance to look at hm
1080069886 [11843] <pam/#webco> pete is aware we are taking them down, you can call him again to say we are doing it right now if need be
1080070232 [11855] <pam/#webco> still on phone, pete's number is on his email sig
1080070858 [11867] <pam/#webco> eric is going to call alex about setting expectations for upgrade, maybe do parallel production
1080070924 [11871] <pam/#webco> gracchus: good that saic import looks pretty good, is that the last step to getting them testing?
1080070971 [11875] <pam/#webco> o good
1080071773 [11883] <pam/#webco> wonderful!
1080071901 [11887] <pam/#webco> should I call john to see if they are all good?
1080072116 [11894] <pam/#webco> ok, left msg for john at chapman
1080072324 [11902] <pam/#webco> ucb is missing another patch, the one that fixed biling duration feature on repeats
1080072333 [11904] <pam/#webco> refusenik: good plan!
1080072342 [11908] <pam/#webco> mmm, lunch
1080072345 [11910] <pam/#webco> another good plan
1080072378 [11916] <pam/#webco> i am sure this one is missing
1080072395 [11920] <pam/#webco> well I guess I suspect it is missing
1080072398 [11922] <pam/#webco> i have not checked
1080072403 [11924] <pam/#webco> will do so
1080072424 [11926] <pam/#webco> altho the bug does not list a patch number
1080072533 [11934] <pam/#webco> hm, 6772 is listed on there but the behavior airdri is reporting is the same as what that patch should fix
1080072783 [11937] <pam/#webco> i reopened charge duration on repeats bug #6772
1080075431 [11961] <pam/#webco> pete says really slow and then they tried to commit something and immediately got an error, calling
1080075502 [11965] <pam/#webco> also, john just emailed that they are getting same error
1080075723 [11969] <pam/#webco> refusenik: just emailed about chapman, there is no ck# that gives them error.  They are trying to make reservation/checkouts and they get it when they hit commikt
1080075861 [11972] <pam/#webco> is the debugger still on there?  they are complaining of slowness
1080075987 [11984] <pam/#webco> I am on their instance in the goldroom.  If I select any CK i get Servlet thread failing with: Error in function WCOF::RUN-RTYPE-SCHEDULER: No resources supplied to type scheduler.<br>
1080076092 [11992] <pam/#webco> click on any ck number, try to bring up any allocation
1080076114 [11994] <pam/#webco> it does not happen on HM
1080076183 [11996] <pam/#webco> did something maybe not complete during the chapman update
1080076239 [12011] <pam/#webco> i don't know, similar thing yesterday when they kept getting the error and I would test and it all seemed to work fine for me
1080076249 [12014] <pam/#webco> ok
1080076333 [12020] <pam/#webco> yes, 5809
1080076343 [12022] <pam/#webco> fails
1080076977 [12036] <pam/#webco> we are in the middle of them having additional problems, getting errors after the update
1080076997 [12040] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you shut them down, are you waiting on me to call them?  i can, just advise pls
1080077060 [12044] <pam/#webco> ok, take em down
1080077085 [12050] <pam/#webco> i told him i would call him back when we are back up and make sure things are working
1080077293 [12054] <pam/#webco> on phone with academyart, they have several issues now, will advise shortly
1080077882 [12060] <pam/#webco> ok, andrei is running into a lot of trouble caused by blocker bug 7167, trying to circulate resources that are returned but are stuck in the system as still checked out on the last order
1080077920 [12064] <pam/#webco> also, says they get a lot of false positives in the timeline scheduler, even if they double click on rtype it may choose one that is not really avaialble and they won't know until they try to confirm
1080078397 [12069] <pam/#webco> refusenik:is that comment in reference to my statements on academyart? you think getting false positives is releated to this rtype schedule issue?
1080078439 [12074] <pam/#webco> how is chapman coming along? still not back up?
1080078684 [12082] <pam/#webco> is it ok to call chapman and have them start back on the system?
1080078773 [12088] <pam/#webco> ok
1080078953 [12090] <pam/#webco> goldroom says it seems ok now, thanks
1080078982 [12092] <pam/#webco> refusenik: we need to schedule academyart to go down for this fix, right?
1080079485 [12101] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, pls advise when is a good time for you to do that, do we want to take them down or wait until late tonight or early tomorrow morning?
1080079642 [12107] <pam/#webco> ok, I will call andrei and find out if it is ok
1080079723 [12111] <pam/#webco> andrei is not around, left a msg for him to call as soon as he returns
1080080316 [12115] <pam/#webco> oh, ok, what about the 437 bad allocations?
1080080610 [12120] <pam/#webco> ok
1080080622 [12122] <pam/#webco> can 7167 be next on the bug hit parade?
1080081202 [12142] <pam/#webco> good, refusenik is starting work on that one
1080081335 [12154] <pam/#webco> i don't think so, andrei reported having trouble with resources that were actually rerturned early
1080082517 [12198] <pam/#webco> eric: i really do not think it is releated to late returns, I have an example of one on academyart that is in that state that was returned early
1080082549 [12201] <pam/#webco> and it still is not "overdue" cause the due back time isn't for another three hours
1080083810 [12224] <pam/#webco> eric-pec: no, aac does not use barcoding yet
1080084514 [12273] <pam/#webco> eric: no, he had the sales call earlier and then a doctor appointment, he said he was coming in after so I expect him soon
1080086422 [12390] <pam/#webco> pete just sent in email outlining more circulation problems
1080086880 [12395] <pam/#webco> it seems that chapman is being plagued by the false neg bug #7144 caused when using rrt
1080086895 [12397] <pam/#webco> should I suggest to them to not use rrt or what?
1080087193 [12422] <pam/#webco> yes
1080087261 [12429] <pam/#webco> criteria?
1080087272 [12433] <pam/#webco> do you mean what sets the times for that query?
1080087282 [12440] <pam/#webco> the pickup grace period
1080087306 [12444] <pam/#webco> buffers the current time with pickup grace period
1080088448 [12467] <pam/#webco> yes, but about to leave
1080088455 [12470] <pam/#webco> what is up
1080088598 [12474] <pam/#webco> ok, i gotta go
1080088610 [12478] <pam/#webco> sure thing
1080145029 [12716] <pam/#webco> mmm, i like the sound of that
1080145031 [12718] <pam/#webco> good morning
1080146206 [12738] <pam/#webco> eric: evergreen emailed in a request for an ETA of the update 3.1.1, were they experiencing any specific problems that would make this a high priority or should I try to put him off another week or so?
1080147675 [12750] <pam/#webco> i think there are some problems with invoices, is it ok to test on the usc staged instances or is there another place I should be testing?
1080147801 [12764] <pam/#webco> I don't think I need client specific, I noticed some weirdness just poking around on chapman but I can probably test on any data
1080147831 [12771] <pam/#webco> ok
1080147833 [12773] <pam/#webco> 9007?
1080147836 [12777] <pam/#webco> ok
1080147861 [12783] <pam/#webco> either one, you guys just say where
1080150958 [12801] <pam/#webco> a lot of invoice features are not working
1080151127 [12814] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i have been testing against 1955 with pec data, I have a list of notes, you want me to paste items one at a time into irc and you can address?
1080151397 [12826] <pam/#webco> ok, this is a long one about holds
1080151448 [12832] <pam/#webco> All invoices have a history item that says the Administrator turned the invoice into a hold 30 days after its creation.  This would imply that the organization had their Hold Days setting set to 30 but there it says None.  Dont know if this is a migration issue or all invoices are listing a hold by administrator at thirty days regardless of what the org setting is.
1080151459 [12837] <pam/#webco> Even though invoice says it is a hold in the History of the invoice it does not have a Hold Date on the left frame nor does it say Invoice (HOLD) and I believe it used to. In find invoices you dont get any results unless you check the box that says Converted to Hold but then in the result set the Hold column, they all say No.  
1080151468 [12839] <pam/#webco> If you pay an invoice that the adminstrator turned into a hold the patron record still shows that patron in hold status.
1080153219 [12864] <pam/#webco> refusenik: we are thier sysadmin :)
1080153244 [12875] <pam/#webco> yes it can
1080153272 [12879] <pam/#webco> or just set all their other clock to be 15 min fast too
1080154061 [12931] <pam/#webco> eric and refusenik: so there is a fix for the resources checked back in but not being availalble? is so we need to get it to academyart, after usc tests a bit 
1080154242 [12952] <pam/#webco> any blockers?
1080154520 [12963] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, should we proceed with a restart to at least clean out the current problems caused by this?  how much down time do we need?
1080155353 [12980] <pam/#webco> refusenik: pls go ahead and stop/restart academyart now 
1080155407 [12987] <pam/#webco> academyart just reported that the adminstrator is returning reservations in the issue room (at least) and they do not have autocirculate turned on any where!  is this new or known issue?
1080155797 [13008] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you turn off autocirculate along with the restart?
1080155816 [13010] <pam/#webco> eric: i don't understand comment: was that their circumstance
1080155842 [13012] <pam/#webco> oic
1080156313 [13020] <pam/#webco> gracchus: go ahead
1080156322 [13022] <pam/#webco> refusenik: thanks 
1080157319 [13051] <pam/#webco> refusenik: academyart does not barcode yet so they don't use rapid return
1080158709 [13105] <pam/#webco> 123
1080158747 [13109] <pam/#webco> ok
1080159601 [13123] <pam/#webco> eric: fyi, bernie's electrician came by, needs to do some work for the building which means shutting down the power here, eek, we are checking with Jesse about when is a good time
1080160002 [13143] <pam/#webco> eric: bernie did not give us heads up, the guy said he could do it on a sunday which would be better I think
1080163940 [13152] <pam/#webco> hold seem much better now
1080164861 [13167] <pam/#webco> i just email airdri, ill let her retest since it is their production instance
1080165025 [13171] <pam/#webco> yes
1080166735 [13183] <pam/#webco> i know the false neg was causing trouble for them yesterday
1080166839 [13194] <pam/#webco> what are the problems?
1080167012 [13210] <pam/#webco> hm, that came up before but when using rrt I think
1080167279 [13232] <pam/#webco> yikes
1080167329 [13236] <pam/#webco>  are they listed on the activity log but not cotents
1080169730 [13303] <pam/#webco> ok, can't stay late tonight. I will see you all tomorrow
1080236590 [13604] <pam/#webco> refusenik: was the addition to the bug for charge duration in response to airdri saying it still does not work correctly?
1080236658 [13610] <pam/#webco> ok, great
1080236720 [13618] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok
1080236796 [13624] <pam/#webco> E-Chapman: bernie called me this morning, trying to figure out a time they can shut the power down here
1080236832 [13633] <pam/#webco> E-Chapman: yah, the electrician can't do it on sundays, we only host east coast client here, right?
1080236845 [13640] <pam/#webco> E-Chapman: we do need to make sure they won't need the system in the evenings
1080236857 [13644] <pam/#webco> E-Chapman: accd is at onshore, no?
1080236890 [13652] <pam/#webco> E-Chapman: so I think it is just LCC and Ithaca, someone correct me if I am missing someone
1080238016 [13679] <pam/#webco> E-Chapman: chapman going through something, anything I can do to help?
1080238049 [13685] <pam/#webco> anything specific?
1080238642 [13713] <pam/#webco> academyart had the same problem yesterday, refusenik had to disable it cause it was not set any where but was still auto circ
1080238832 [13719] <pam/#webco> ok, just got java exception error
1080239293 [13727] <pam/#webco> eric and dag: either of you testing on ck4446?
1080239324 [13729] <pam/#webco> i just opened it up and two of the itmes on it say RESERVATION on the contents tab, looks like the old mixed state between reservation/checkout bug
1080239362 [13735] <pam/#webco> i have it but maybe someone else is editing it also?
1080239522 [13745] <pam/#webco> yeah, i checked the history, nothing, i thought maybe one of you was in the process of editing so it would not be in history yet
1080239609 [13753] <pam/#webco> hmm, so that is a no from both of you on editing that order then? gracchus, do you want to take a look at it since appears to have a couple of items in reserved state and the rest are checked out?
1080239641 [13759] <pam/#webco> yes
1080241946 [13803] <pam/#webco> usc just filed bug for items falling off of order after commit, 7187
1080242703 [13821] <pam/#webco> academyart reported unserialzed resources do not work, show conflict if you try to check out same resource on orders at the same time
1080242705 [13823] <pam/#webco> filed bug
1080244721 [13906] <pam/#webco> eric: could you ever click on the bookings in view avail window and get a ck?  I only ever saw that in the timeline
1080245694 [13972] <pam/#webco> is the parallel instance meant to stay clean to try and mimick problems at chapman or ok to test on it?
1080250176 [14340] <pam/#webco> gracchus: getting false neg. results blocks almost everything I try to test, should I continue to add comments to bug? tell you? any idea about this getting worked on?
1080250260 [14352] <pam/#webco> gracchus: ok
1080251018 [14382] <pam/#webco> violet in selected resource box means it has a condition note, I don't know why we don't use orange since that is what we use in the center box of the applet
1080251041 [14385] <pam/#webco> or both violet
1080252446 [14429] <pam/#webco> I could do retesting and that would free you up to work on a bug
1080252482 [14431] <pam/#webco> gracchus: we still need to wait to test more?
1080252490 [14435] <pam/#webco> on beta?
1080252495 [14437] <pam/#webco> ok, cool
1080317781 [14561] <pam/#webco> morning
1080317855 [14566] <pam/#webco> this shuting down the power thing is a pain in the ass
1080317929 [14573] <pam/#webco> because the electrician says that the box outside is so old and a piece o crap that it won't make it through the summer
1080317944 [14577] <pam/#webco> but lcc hours are Mon-Thu 7:30am - 9:00pm, Fri 7:30am - 4:00pm, Sat 7:30am - 1:00pm 
1080317959 [14583] <pam/#webco> and ithaca is worse Fridays until 7:30  am - 5:00 pm, Saturdays 8:30 am - 6:00 pm, Sundays 1:30 pm - 11:00 pm, and Monday through Thursday 7:30 am - 11:00 pm
1080317963 [14587] <pam/#webco> hehe
1080317976 [14589] <pam/#webco> and the electrician won't work on sunday
1080317998 [14593] <pam/#webco> we need to schedule two night i guess
1080318002 [14595] <pam/#webco> indeed
1080318016 [14597] <pam/#webco> but someone has to be here to shut everything down and then bring it back up
1080318024 [14599] <pam/#webco> after the work
1080318031 [14605] <pam/#webco> yes
1080318046 [14607] <pam/#webco> it looks like it has to be friday and saturday eve
1080318071 [14609] <pam/#webco> so that means that one of you lucky guys has to come in early on saturday and sunday to make sure the servers are back up for ithaca
1080318078 [14611] <pam/#webco> ick
1080318099 [14617] <pam/#webco> is that serious stmt?  I don't know
1080318147 [14626] <pam/#webco> how much?
1080318159 [14628] <pam/#webco> $$ that is 
1080318405 [14640] <pam/#webco> not long enough, it's going to be down for several hours at a time
1080318592 [14644] <pam/#webco> plus I think that is too expensive
1080318665 [14646] <pam/#webco> but it does mean that someone has to come in either late fiday night or very very ealry sat morning
1080318726 [14650] <pam/#webco> i need to schedule this with the landlord so I can say which saturday I think and lcc has to be up by 730 eastern, 630 our time
1080318819 [14658] <pam/#webco> ok, mail would be great
1080320071 [14665] <pam/#webco> gracchus: what is the testing plan for today?  I left yesterday before chance to work on the false neg. problem, is that on deck?
1080320129 [14671] <pam/#webco> ok, just let me know when you need me
1080321405 [14680] <pam/#webco> I can't imagine a case of using rrt and unserialized at the same time
1080321763 [14686] <pam/#webco> ok
1080327172 [14773] <pam/#webco> joel inden is pec, i can look it up for you
1080327211 [14775] <pam/#webco> 213 740-2898
1080328040 [14792] <pam/#webco> perry from usc sent in report, having multiple problems with rapid return but not more detail than that.  I have asked for more info but I am sure they are the same ones eric is reporting
1080328102 [14796] <pam/#webco> jason m from usc also emailed in the morning asking when cinapps might be ready, do we have any kind of estimate for that?
1080328782 [14802] <pam/#webco> ok, great
1080668378 [15757] <pam/#webco> somewhat
1080668396 [15759] <pam/#webco> so accd called and wants be to explainto them how to export data, make changes and then import it back in
1080668407 [15761] <pam/#webco> wants me I should say
1080668410 [15763] <pam/#webco> ??
1080668438 [15768] <pam/#webco> also, they reported some time ago about tickets not printing and they really would like that fixed but they still don't have the latest release
1080668456 [15772] <pam/#webco> well since I don't know how to export and import I am going to need some ones help
1080668530 [15778] <pam/#webco> i would say yes, resources
1080669076 [15799] <pam/#webco> sigwtf: so I can point rick torres from art center in your direction to assist in the resource?  he left msg so I need to call him back
1080670014 [15805] <pam/#webco> yes, I can handle that part of it
1080670060 [15807] <pam/#webco> I do think that when we have some time we should update the example templates to have more like media equipment examples in them instead of the food ones
1080670096 [15815] <pam/#webco> well I havn't even talked to him yet, he is in a meeting so can you wait until I speak to him
1080670571 [15832] <pam/#webco> sigwtf: could we just take a sample from demo?
1080670596 [15834] <pam/#webco> eric-chap: did you talk to usc about cinapps?
1080670624 [15836] <pam/#webco> do we have a wrench downstairs?
1080670961 [15849] <pam/#webco> eric-chap: ok, just so you are aware, Jason M sent an email on Thursday at 5pm asking about the status and it has not been responded to
1080672999 [15893] <pam/#webco> gracchus: so you believe the academyart items falling off orders is operator error?  they look  like legitimate problem orders, like the system dropped items
1080677607 [15917] <pam/#webco> i think eric is on a conf call with dan
1080681911 [15949] <pam/#webco> sigwtf: are you still working on the unserialized resource bug for academyart?
1080682199 [15957] <pam/#webco> ok
1080750881 [16297] <pam/#webco> and that the single page agreement form was installed?
1080751127 [16303] <pam/#webco> oy, pls make is so
1080751442 [16321] <pam/#webco> eric: don't some of our clients use the three part?
1080751489 [16334] <pam/#webco> eric: i can take some time and start to re-test the open bugs
1080751500 [16336] <pam/#webco> sigwtf: good thinking
1080751567 [16349] <pam/#webco> we need to figure out a plan for accd, they have many little bugs they have reported over the last couple of months that they are now starting to make some noise about, the nerve
1080751579 [16358] <pam/#webco> sigwtf: that is artcenter
1080751624 [16366] <pam/#webco> I assume we are not going to address them on the code they are on and we need a plan to upgrade them
1080751650 [16368] <pam/#webco> any opinions on that?
1080751666 [16374] <pam/#webco> right, I got that msg, there are a few more too, I spoke with rik d yesterday too
1080751700 [16376] <pam/#webco> remember they had the 30 point list of things, some of which have been addressed, some invalid and some remain open
1080751866 [16387] <pam/#webco> were you guys dealing with double booking of items for chapman?  academyart has reported this and I would like to know if it has been addressed already
1080751880 [16390] <pam/#webco> example from andrei: For your information ck-1321 seems to have the same
1080751880 [16392] <pam/#webco> overlapping booking problem that we were having before.  there are several
1080751880 [16396] <pam/#webco> c-clamps that are booked to go out today (3/30), but the note by them says
1080751880 [16399] <pam/#webco> they are unavailable until 3/31 in ck-2540.
1080751984 [16403] <pam/#webco> ok, just making sure it was not something new!
1080751989 [16405] <pam/#webco> good good
1080752019 [16409] <pam/#webco> sigwtf: did you see mail from our friend frank tate? do you have a min to take a peek at their instance and see if it is really moving slowly for some reason?
1080752116 [16416] <pam/#webco> ok
1080752866 [16428] <pam/#webco> eric: ok
1080756912 [16454] <pam/#webco> do we have an updated testing instance?
1080757932 [16474] <pam/#webco> I have not started yet, on phone, but I would like to know where an updated testing instance is
1080757995 [16477] <pam/#webco> i need to call artcenter, can we make a plan for them pls?
1080758171 [16484] <pam/#webco> what do you mean what is required?
1080758257 [16488] <pam/#webco> oh, sorry, thought you were talking about artcenter
1080758273 [16491] <pam/#webco> um, how about chapman data, it is better than demo set
1080758921 [16507] <pam/#webco> fyi,scheduled csustan for move to their server and update  on monday april 12th
1080758928 [16509] <pam/#webco> first thing in morning
1080764545 [16642] <pam/#webco> be back in about 15 min
1080770313 [16682] <pam/#webco> eric-chap are you doing something on boris? seems hung up now
1080770640 [16685] <pam/#webco> never mind, finally kicked in
1080772858 [16747] <pam/#webco> i was trying to enter the barcode of an outgoing resource that was an offline resource when it froze up, not sure if that has anything to do with it
1080773561 [16845] <pam/#webco> gracchus: can we talk about a plan to move artcenter to the new branch next week? what do you think about that?
1080773568 [16847] <pam/#webco> new build i mean
1080773611 [16854] <pam/#webco> there are a couple of smaller issues that I would like to see get addressed for them as well but I think they are easy
1080773619 [16856] <pam/#webco> they have a filedrop
1080773627 [16864] <pam/#webco> yes
1080773703 [16902] <pam/#webco> they would really like it if we could fix the print ticket and email from invoices too
1080773778 [16906] <pam/#webco> great, and filedrop should be ok or it would need to get some work?
1080773818 [16908] <pam/#webco> I have accd in the subject of their bugs so I will upgrade them and you can find them by that
1080774353 [16922] <pam/#webco> there are 11 open accd specific bugs, I uped 4 of them to see if they can be addressed before updating them next week
1080774370 [16927] <pam/#webco> i must go to pick up gordon at the airport

1080860386 [17840] <pam/#webco> why is it always that as soon as sigwtf leaves we get problems from usc, academyart and ucla within 15 min
1080860509 [17842] <pam/#webco> ucla blocker filed
1080860541 [17850] <pam/#webco> well yes but I am not sure they are even in production, just trying to get there
1080860557 [17854] <pam/#webco> they fell off the webco wagon long ago when they were supposed to be a vangaurd of 3.1
1080860591 [17856] <pam/#webco> I advised Angie that we would not be able to take a look at the problem until Monday and she said she would have Chris Dutton call if that was a problem 
1080860602 [17858] <pam/#webco> so no need to let it interrupt your current work plan
1080860792 [17860] <pam/#webco> hm, official speed complaint for usc as well
1080861013 [17864] <pam/#webco> no craig mAcNEely
1080861031 [17866] <pam/#webco> here's what he had to say: Hi Pam...no that's the first I've seen of this.  But like I was telling Jason earlier, when I go from icon to icon it's very slow.  The checkout's aren't too bad, but the other pages are painfully slow.  And when I try to print, it's slow.  I've tried other webpages that are NOT webcheckout, and they print right away.
1080861844 [17875] <pam/#webco> please take academyart down for update now, they really need to be up but the speed is killing them andrei said
1080861858 [17885] <pam/#webco> yes pls

1080923727 [197] <pam/#webco> no, he is moving today, if you need him you'll have to call his cell
1080927436 [207] <pam/#webco> gracchus: csustan is not getting response from webco, can you check it out?  he said he can ping the server but accessing url just hangs browser

1081186540 [541] <pam/#webco> in pec, search for ck 43715 gets this error Servlet thread failing with: Error in function COMMON-LISP::ASSERT-ERROR: Object argument to display-property is null.<br> 
1081186648 [543] <pam/#webco> does anyone have to time to check now or should I open blocker bug?
1081186874 [551] <pam/#webco> how up to date is the build on usc?
1081186919 [556] <pam/#webco> they are having a problem with returned items on a checkout blocking renewal because the returned items have been sent out on different orders, blocking because they say unavaialable on the checkout they are trying to renew
1081186933 [558] <pam/#webco> this sounds like something that was addressed already but maybe I am confusing it with something else
1081186986 [562] <pam/#webco> ok, we will need to coordinate an update to them
1081187206 [568] <pam/#webco> i don't know, do you think that error will be corrected by the update?
1081187223 [571] <pam/#webco> how long of a down time do we need to update their build? 15 min?
1081187577 [578] <pam/#webco> can we just do pec or do I have to coordinate all the departments?
1081187667 [582] <pam/#webco> I would want to do pec when they say and then update the usc instance first thing in the morning before they open, then they are both on same build, is that ok?
1081187707 [586] <pam/#webco> cool

1081361424 [1582] <pam/#webco> perfect, thanks
1081362003 [1596] <pam/#webco> gracchus: you and refusenik duke it out and let me know who wins
1081362065 [1601] <pam/#webco> ithaca is down, o please someone save poor ellen
1081363026 [1610] <pam/#webco> usc appears to have current data and lots of it
1081367242 [1620] <pam/#webco> gracchus: back?
1081375197 [1686] <pam/#webco> gracchus: you have worked out the renewal of partial return bug, yes?  is it somewhere to test? can we push it out to academyart, usc and chapman or need to wait?
1081375735 [1710] <pam/#webco> chapman demille hall has an error on their hours tab so they can not set up schedules which is blocking them from viewing schedules to set up orders, opened blocker
1081375922 [1719] <pam/#webco> chapman demille hall has an error on their hours tab so they can not set up schedules which is blocking them from viewing schedules to set up orders, opened blocker
1081375968 [1727] <pam/#webco> no
1081375987 [1733] <pam/#webco> thx
1081376403 [1737] <pam/#webco> i very tired so I am heading home
1081376458 [1745] <pam/#webco> nope, nada
1081376480 [1749] <pam/#webco> hopefully all went well
1081376508 [1753] <pam/#webco> great
1081442844 [2105] <pam/#webco> hey guys
1081442953 [2108] <pam/#webco> how are things today?
1081442962 [2112] <pam/#webco> here are my list of questions :)
1081442985 [2114] <pam/#webco> did ucs, chapman and academyart get update for the renewal of partial returns bug or does that need more testing?
1081442996 [2116] <pam/#webco> any progress on ucla view by locations?
1081443006 [2118] <pam/#webco> usc cinapps done?
1081443009 [2120] <pam/#webco> :)
1081443011 [2122] <pam/#webco> :)
1081443012 [2124] <pam/#webco> :)
1081443045 [2126] <pam/#webco> cute AND annoying, how does she do it?
1081443231 [2141] <pam/#webco> es goot
1081443350 [2151] <pam/#webco> i shall do my best noble knight
1081443425 [2155] <pam/#webco> i can hardly wait to view jousting while sucking on a big ole turkey bone
1081443469 [2162] <pam/#webco> is boris up to date? i can test renewal of partial returns there?
1081443527 [2173] <pam/#webco> but whining is his specialty
1081443644 [2175] <pam/#webco> ah, good one refusenik!  we have a bug filed already for what he did do that caused the error, just haven't gotten to fixing that one yet
1081443828 [2182] <pam/#webco> that is the "group" you create when you make a resource type require authorization, I can give you a little walk through on the interface if you want to understand it
1081444175 [2187] <pam/#webco> no, don't believe so
1081446215 [2195] <pam/#webco> gracchus: dag filed a blocker bug, 7223 which blocks testing the renewal of partial return fix
1081446261 [2197] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i forgot one earlier, did you get a chance to look at the demille hall hours of opertion bug at chapman yesterday?
1081446443 [2203] <pam/#webco> ok
1081446952 [2223] <pam/#webco> testing on boris is blocked, getting failed squl queries in many many places
1081446958 [2227] <pam/#webco> sql
1081447132 [2243] <pam/#webco> ok
1081447183 [2245] <pam/#webco> click any ck from pickup or return screen, also, hit the find button on groups search
1081447357 [2265] <pam/#webco> gracchus: seems all good now,thanks, we'll let you know if it comes up again
1081449912 [2314] <pam/#webco> gracchus: renewal of partial returns is only half fixed
1081449947 [2316] <pam/#webco> if a returned resource gets checked out on a different order that checkout will still block the renewal of ther order that resource has been returned on
1081451588 [2325] <pam/#webco> gracchus: just got that sql bug adding a patron to a group, enter partial name in the add member field and hit Add button
1081451821 [2327] <pam/#webco> shoot, now I get it when I click on a class or group name to go to the detail screen 
1081452223 [2332] <pam/#webco> is it possible to get the help desk module turned on on boris?
1081452397 [2340] <pam/#webco> thanks and thanks
1081455196 [2364] <pam/#webco> mmm, lunch
1081455365 [2370] <pam/#webco> yes!
1081459970 [2389] <pam/#webco> refusenik: reminder that I am out tomorrow and msu must have their allocation information cleaned out tomorrow, there is a bug, 6622, Frank said they can go down at 2pm our time
1081459985 [2391] <pam/#webco> alos, frank asked to go back to 3-part form
1081459989 [2393] <pam/#webco> for print agreement
1081461854 [2400] <pam/#webco> hello?
1081461968 [2406] <pam/#webco> thanks
1081782322 [2550] <pam/#webco> hi!
1081782325 [2552] <pam/#webco> is there coffee down there?
1081782334 [2554] <pam/#webco> ready that is?
1081788639 [2562] <pam/#webco> refusenik: email from chapman, their server is down, not sure if we can do anything?
1081788656 [2564] <pam/#webco> can you looky look?
1081790870 [2570] <pam/#webco> refusenik: on with pete, I can tunnel but he is still having trouble, if I try the IP he gave in his last email it just hangs as well
1081790885 [2572] <pam/#webco> is there anything more we can do or is this an issue for his IT person?
1081791006 [2574] <pam/#webco> ftvwco.chapman.edu/apps/wco
1081791124 [2582] <pam/#webco> that is what he is giving me, he is double checking
1081791162 [2586] <pam/#webco> he says he has never used that
1081791434 [2598] <pam/#webco> he gets a "this page can not be displayed" using 8084 url, I can get it to come up
1081791462 [2605] <pam/#webco> oh wait, he got it
1081791605 [2613] <pam/#webco> he doesn't know, it was the IT guy that did it.  He is forwarding your mail that you just sent to him, Todd I think
1081791620 [2618] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks, they are back in using their normal url
1081795159 [2756] <pam/#webco> great, thanks
1081795176 [2758] <pam/#webco> does testing site have the view by location fix?
1081795389 [2760] <pam/#webco> I found that trying to renew a checkout that had partial returns where some of the returned resources were sent out on other orders failed.  The returned resources blocked the renewal because it seemed the system was checking their availablity for the new return time, does that make sense?
1081795449 [2766] <pam/#webco> that would be great
1081798639 [2780] <pam/#webco> gracchus: seems view by location works as it should on boris, can we update ucla tonight or first thing in the am?
1081799869 [2808] <pam/#webco> gracchus: yes pls, first thing since they are pacific time
1081799899 [2810] <pam/#webco> they havn't really been in production all that much but my guess would be that they would want single page since they have some larger orders
1081799928 [2812] <pam/#webco> i can email chris and ask
1081803515 [2880] <pam/#webco> got the ok from ucla to update them first thing in the morning and please config single page aggrement form for them
1081803742 [2883] <pam/#webco> gracchus: do you need a bug opened to remind you for this tomorrow?
1081803900 [2887] <pam/#webco> gracchus: just so you are aware, usc called me again today about 7215, pls let me know when you need me to test more on that 
1081874181 [3013] <pam/#webco> hello
1081874190 [3015] <pam/#webco> gracchus: any update on 2715?
1081874249 [3017] <pam/#webco> sorry, i mean 7215
1081878815 [3052] <pam/#webco> I need usage fees enabled on boris testing instance pls
1081878969 [3061] <pam/#webco> yes please
1081879191 [3065] <pam/#webco> thanks
1081883179 [3077] <pam/#webco> is there some reason why the applet only loads in about 3/4 of the space of the screen now?
1081883617 [3097] <pam/#webco> ok, filed
1081883627 [3099] <pam/#webco> gracchus: any movement on 7215?
1081887050 [3123] <pam/#webco> grrr, why would searching groups/classes suddenly stop working, was working fine now getting Servlet thread failing with: Error in function ODCL::PACKAGE-FOR-SYMBOL: No mapping for symbol storage: (WCOF::GROUP . WCOF::ORIGIN)<br> 
1081887434 [3129] <pam/#webco> its on boris
1081887552 [3131] <pam/#webco> gracchus: should I file that or does testing site need an update?
1081889610 [3147] <pam/#webco> i need to run out for about 15 min, pls to watch the support list for any fires
1081890614 [3154] <pam/#webco> you can take your goggles off ow

1081895558 [3176] <pam/#webco> dern
1081896908 [3183] <pam/#webco> going home
1081955187 [3222] <pam/#webco> morning
1081955254 [3228] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I know you looked last night before you left but academy art is crawling, there is a very noticiable speed problem, can you pls check again?
1081955312 [3233] <pam/#webco> i am trying to log in and it is just hanging, hasn't even loaded a page yet
1081956452 [3243] <pam/#webco> ok, pls do what you can, the system is pretty close to unusable for them, I tried to load the groups find page and it took amost 3 min just to load the page after clicking the icon
1081956698 [3253] <pam/#webco> i am trying to load url now, just haning

1081957159 [3273] <pam/#webco> do you need me to continue with this?
1081957192 [3277] <pam/#webco> ok
1081957849 [3291] <pam/#webco> ok
1081958664 [3308] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks, does seem better
1081979909 [3512] <pam/#onshored> pam?
1081979917 [3516] <pam/#onshored> hi joshy!
1081980085 [3536] <pam/#onshored> what, you dont' want a larger penis?
1081980636 [3550] <pam/#onshored> hehe
1082046942 [3631] <pam/#webco>  hey hey
1082046960 [3635] <pam/#webco> refusenik: wow, nice morniing, slow reports at 3 schools
1082046965 [3638] <pam/#webco> what is the update?
1082047067 [3648] <pam/#webco> i am running a little slow today too, what can you do about that?
1082047365 [3656] <pam/#webco> did you notice any improvement on evergreen after running the vacuumdb?  should I email wyatt and say we did some cleaning up and ask if he still sees a speed issue?
1082047487 [3666] <pam/#webco> refusenik: have you been in contact with academyart? do they know we restarted and speed should be better or I need to contact them too?
1082047633 [3675] <pam/#webco> what do you mean by an email notification list?
1082047908 [3679] <pam/#webco> ah, you should ask andrei for a list as well then, they are in different departments that do not interact so the list would be different for each of them
1082047971 [3687] <pam/#webco> hehe
1082049410 [3692] <pam/#webco> is there an updated testing instance?
1082050319 [3694] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you think we can coordinate a  db vacuum and restart for usc to see if it improves their speed?  I don't mind calling Jason M to get it worked out, how much down time do we need?
1082053356 [3711] <pam/#webco> sure, when would you like to do that?
1082053494 [3717] <pam/#webco> ok, calling Jason
1082053548 [3721] <pam/#webco> Jason is going to coordinate with the departments and call back to advise when is good for them
1082053916 [3725] <pam/#webco> oh
1082054427 [3729] <pam/#webco> gracchus: are you back on 7215?  I just got another call from academyart
1082055027 [3737] <pam/#webco> refuseenik: you can go ahead with usc restart, should we restart both just to see if that will improve the speed problems Michael Trainer from Zemekis reported?
1082055569 [3744] <pam/#webco> ok, jason restarting instances
1082057660 [3750] <pam/#webco> hm, usc seems down still, i get java exception error tunneling to usc instance
1082057720 [3752] <pam/#webco> and usc-pec instance gets stame
1082057723 [3754] <pam/#webco> same
1082057775 [3756] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you trouble shoot or do I need to call Jason?
1082058149 [3765] <pam/#webco> great, thanks
1082058305 [3767] <pam/#webco> still getting java.exception error at usc-pec, usc instance seems ok
1082058888 [3771] <pam/#webco> it is up now
1082058961 [3775] <pam/#webco> makes me feel warm and fuzzy
1082128347 [3894] <pam/#webco> howdy
1082128386 [3898] <pam/#webco> ithink the first day it hits 80 should be a company holiday
1082128709 [3900] <pam/#webco> can I get an updated testing instance please please please
1082129030 [3906] <pam/#webco> sweet, can I get a daiquiri then?
1082130037 [3917] <pam/#webco> well, I know you guys and eric talked about the media clients yesterday and you guys want to make the "chages" to the current build instead of working out their problems on 3.0.5 media
1082130046 [3920] <pam/#webco> I still don't entirely agree
1082130084 [3924] <pam/#webco> I understand you desires and they are very valid but I don't think the issues with sfsu and utexas are really big ones and that we should leave them waiting longer
1082130095 [3926] <pam/#webco> if you read the bugs you can get an idea of what their needs are
1082130130 [3928] <pam/#webco> utexas hit one error which seemed pretty random and then need a couple of small changes, a date format change and the format that text is stored in a certain field
1082130138 [3930] <pam/#webco> no circulation or major issues that I can see
1082130169 [3934] <pam/#webco> sfsu's only issue, as far as I have been told, is that the data they sent had some strange characters in it and that is all we were held up by
1082130194 [3940] <pam/#webco> clams: thanks
1082130234 [3942] <pam/#webco> according to craigB, sfsu was ready to go, just need to bring in data
1082130249 [3946] <pam/#webco> of course there are many items that craigB said were "done" or ready and they certainly weren
1082130251 [3948] <pam/#webco> 't
1082130357 [3954] <pam/#webco> according to craigB, the import code was ready but their data had some bad formating or charachters or something, eric told me yesterday that he was able to bring their data up on a Mac
1082130388 [3956] <pam/#webco> craigB didn't think the woman at sfsu had the ability to clean up the data so it was kind of waiting on us to do 
1082130486 [3960] <pam/#webco> does #2 mean that he didn't actually get it the point where all is needed is data in proper format?
1082130567 [3962] <pam/#webco> i would be ok with putting sfsu off until Monday when eric and dan are back and we can peice together what is still needed and a plan to get that done, If craig did not do the work he said he did then I am willing to back you guys up on waiting on that one to get the media in 3.1 where it needs to be
1082130691 [3964] <pam/#webco> ?
1082130717 [3966] <pam/#webco> enjoys her almond butter, yum
1082130738 [3970] <pam/#webco> i wish I could say I was shocked by that
1082130819 [3976] <pam/#webco> ok, we will leave sfsu for now and put the plan you discussed with eric yesterday for them
1082130844 [3978] <pam/#webco> what about utexas? do you think those small changes could be made to their current version?
1082130861 [3983] <pam/#webco> maybe I am incorrect in assuming they are small changes, in which case feel free to smack me around
1082130919 [3987] <pam/#webco> but brian O at utexas is a mean mean mean man and if we can make the changes and I don't have to call to explaing to hiim why after weeks of telling him we are going to get to his issues that he has to wait another month I would be very grateful
1082130991 [3992] <pam/#webco> if we can work on his issues on 3.0.5 I don't have to call him but I will have to if we put it off until 3.1 media is up to snuff
1082133350 [3999] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what is next on your list to do then?
1082133407 [4001] <pam/#webco> gracchus: any movement on 7215?
1082133542 [4005] <pam/#webco> k
1082133815 [4008] <pam/#webco> refusenik: email invoice error still exists
1082133839 [4010] <pam/#webco> are you testing by emailing from the invoice admin tab or using the email function on the Find invoice screen?
1082133850 [4012] <pam/#webco> cause it only happens when emailing from the invoice itself
1082134266 [4017] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i can recreate the part of 7215 that is still not working on boris
1082134280 [4019] <pam/#webco> do you want to see it?
1082134362 [4021] <pam/#webco> hm, resource details missing a couple of tabs on new build, weird
1082134486 [4027] <pam/#webco> yes, thats it
1082134503 [4029] <pam/#webco> demo has academyart data on it?
1082134519 [4033] <pam/#webco> i thought we weren't allowed to put client data on our demo
1082134545 [4043] <pam/#webco> demo.webcheckout.net
1082134555 [4045] <pam/#webco> def. academyart data
1082135465 [4053] <pam/#webco> no thanks tho
1082138871 [4059] <pam/#webco> gracchus: when you get back can I need to talk about usc request on print agreement
1082138903 [4062] <pam/#webco> joel called and they used to have the production ID on their forms and they dont now
1082140645 [4084] <pam/#webco> gracchus: I need to call joel back so what can I tell him?  the forms are changing with the next update and we can configure is with the production numbers back on for them?
1082140757 [4089] <pam/#webco> ok, when can we expect to update them?  maybe after 7208 gets knocked out?
1082140786 [4095] <pam/#webco> yipeeeeeeeeee
1082140814 [4099] <pam/#webco> i do i do i do
1082140838 [4106] <pam/#webco> ok, will try
1082141200 [4115] <pam/#webco> refusenik: boris seems hung up now, I hit the send email button on and invoice I created and it has been a couple min of spining
1082141205 [4117] <pam/#webco> gracchus: ok
1082141425 [4127] <pam/#webco> i tried an existing invoice first, worked fine, so I went to a patron record, changed the Local Email address to my own and then created an abuse fine charge for patron, when invoice came up I clicked the email invoice button on admin tab
1082141882 [4131] <pam/#webco> gracchus: renewals seem to work wonderfully now
1082141924 [4133] <pam/#webco> the only thing I noticed that I think I should file seperately is that if you return an item on a checkout and then want to add it back on the order at a later time you can't, i will file
1082141962 [4137] <pam/#webco> oh, and now in the applet is says Processing Checkout-contents with the little stop watch thing all the time, very confusing for user
1082142428 [4141] <pam/#webco> when can we update academyart and usc? I would like you to look at 7239 b/f we do that too
1082142435 [4143] <pam/#webco> maybe we could schedule for monday morning?
1082142734 [4148] <pam/#webco> ok, I will call and clear with usc and academyart
1082143060 [4152] <pam/#webco> ok, academyart is good to go for update at 9am on monday morning, they are excited to get agreement forms that actually will print on more than one page!
1082143065 [4154] <pam/#webco> left msg for usc
1082145430 [4162] <pam/#webco> spoke to Jason at usc, they can be updated monday morning after academyart, they don't open until 830 pacific so that gives us plenty of time after aart
1082145544 [4169] <pam/#webco> oh nice
1082145569 [4171] <pam/#webco> i have a list of bug that should come next, for msu and accd to get new build
1082145582 [4173] <pam/#webco> we can review on monday if guys would like
1082145643 [4179] <pam/#webco> ok, some are def need b/f update, some would be nice and three are what I believe are migration bugs so I think they should be knocked out b/f we update any one else
1082145695 [4183] <pam/#webco> they all now say msu/accd in the subject line
1082150253 [4205] <pam/#webco> sure
1082150383 [4208] <pam/#webco> seems to work now
1082150606 [4212] <pam/#webco> i am going to leave  a little early, must drop off something and go to bank
1082150937 [4218] <pam/#webco> well not "sure" but I tried what I did before and it worked successfully
1082151051 [4224] <pam/#webco> no worries, there will be more bugs
1082151065 [4226] <pam/#webco> i tried a couple different times and worked every time 
1082390458 [4581] <refusenik/#webco> 1082145430 [4162] <pam/#webco> spoke to Jason at usc, they can be updated monday morning after academyart, they don't open until 8
1082390458 [4587] <refusenik/#webco> [Friday afternonon] <pam/#webco> spoke to Jason at usc, they can be updated monday morning after academyart, they don't open until 8
1082480636 [4878] <pam/#webco> i am on phone with him now
1082480667 [4882] <pam/#webco> the add person field is not accepting IDs, if you enter an id instead of a name and hit return it hangs in Finding Patron
1082480725 [4884] <pam/#webco> they scan id cards and really need that to work if it possible to fix
1082480729 [4886] <pam/#webco> quickly that is
1082480786 [4888] <pam/#webco> ??
1082480788 [4892] <pam/#webco> yes
1082481015 [4898] <pam/#webco> it does not allow you to proceed, if you try to enter a resource you get no patron selected error
1082481026 [4900] <pam/#webco> I asked him to type in names for the time being
1082481652 [4912] <pam/#webco> larry onthe phone and the unserialized resources are broken again, shoot shoot shoot
1082481693 [4914] <pam/#webco> this one needs to be addressed asap
1082481697 [4916] <pam/#webco> can someone take it?
1082481705 [4918] <pam/#webco> photo does a lot of unseralized stuff
1082481948 [4922] <pam/#webco> no, simply behaves as if it was serialized
1082482037 [4932] <pam/#webco> actually that is not true
1082482052 [4934] <pam/#webco> you can book them at the same time on different orders but you can only put one on an order
1082482077 [4936] <pam/#webco> if you add one to the pick resource list it removes it from the the middle list of resources and you can't add any more
1082485454 [5013] <pam/#webco> oh thanks
1082486182 [5023] <pam/#webco> i didn't test that
1082490933 [5092] <pam/#webco> the msu/accd list was knocked in half over the weekend, fantastic job!
1082491505 [5098] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i opened 7242 and 7243 for the applet problems academyart reported, I think you are working on them already
1082493683 [5109] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you want to do a staging of the latest build for cstan before updating them?
1082493737 [5111] <pam/#webco> when do you want to do that?  they just reported another bug
1082494702 [5122] <pam/#webco> i have copies of craig's emails that outlined it, i can give to you
1082496461 [5130] <pam/#webco> new list of the bug hit parade, the top ten has turned into the top 15 but it includes all remaining items for msu/accd update
1082496565 [5134] <pam/#webco> i am sending two copies to the printer on 2 for craig and jesse
1082497422 [5138] <pam/#webco> shoot, I forgot a couple of bugs
1082497467 [5140] <pam/#webco> gracchus: the one were it always says updating checkout contents on the applet is still there, i thought you were going to kill that one before the update yesterday but I guess you didn't get to it
1082497473 [5142] <pam/#webco> the applet that is
1082497997 [5146] <pam/#webco> understandable, can you get that with the applet bugs you are currently working on?
1082498034 [5150] <pam/#webco> thanks
1082562583 [5253] <pam/#webco> academyart is down with bad gateway error, please fix
1082562636 [5257] <pam/#webco> yes
1082562670 [5262] <pam/#webco> oy, ok
1082562691 [5266] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks for the update 
1082563102 [5272] <pam/#webco> ithaca is down
1082563110 [5274] <pam/#webco> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
1082563195 [5282] <pam/#webco> academyart is on the phone
1082563210 [5288] <pam/#webco> applet is empty, no resource types
1082563245 [5292] <pam/#webco> the Processing: checkout-contents is filed already, it has been saying that all the time but did not keep from making orders
1082563277 [5295] <pam/#webco> what to say to andrei? we are fixing now?
1082563364 [5302] <pam/#webco> this is like the fifth time we have fixed something for them and when they come back up the resource types are missing from the applet, isn't there someway to keep that from happening all the time?
1082563938 [5310] <pam/#webco> pls let me know when it is fixed so I can call andrei back
1082564216 [5317] <pam/#webco> thanks
1082564364 [5321] <pam/#webco> reminder: I am out on vacation starting tomorrow and back in the office next tuesday
1082568519 [5334] <pam/#webco> wonderful
1082570772 [5346] <pam/#webco> gracchus and refusenik: you guys going to be around in a half hour?
1082577680 [5374] <pam/#webco> sorry, I missed your request above for greg's contact info
1082577702 [5376] <pam/#webco> now chapman has bad gateway error
1082577761 [5378] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you get that?
1082577951 [5388] <pam/#webco> geez, sorry
1082578098 [5392] <pam/#webco> i would like to test the academyart list sent in, can I get an up to date testing instance when some one has a moment pls'
1082578868 [5402] <pam/#webco> i guess but its not great
1082578880 [5404] <pam/#webco> refusenik: vong on the phone, can I transfer to you?
1082578885 [5406] <pam/#webco> from academyart
1082579624 [5410] <pam/#webco> ok, good
1082579637 [5412] <pam/#webco> is someone working on chapman?
1082579669 [5416] <pam/#webco> yes, they reported bad gateway error and I just tried to tunnel in and it is hanging
1082579699 [5420] <pam/#webco> thanks
1082579726 [5424] <pam/#webco> yes
1082579760 [5427] <pam/#webco> but if it is hanging up every time there is an override that would be bad and need some looky  looky
1082579822 [5431] <pam/#webco> just got the log in page so they are very very slooow
1082579894 [5437] <pam/#webco> yes, I want you to do what ever you do when the system is just hanging on every request
1082579910 [5441] <pam/#webco> yes, I will bring the tissue
1082579989 [5445] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i know this frustrates you but if I am watching it take several min just to log in then there has to be something wrong and I would consider the system unusable to the end user
1082580147 [5450] <pam/#webco> very dr seussian
1082580230 [5452] <pam/#webco> you can restart wco for chapman in 5 min
1082580438 [5466] <pam/#webco> no, i called pete
1082580544 [5474] <pam/#webco> he said give him 5 min and then it is ok to take them down
1082580549 [5479] <pam/#webco> ok
1082581181 [5491] <pam/#webco> oh man, I don't know if I could handle that
1082581188 [5494] <pam/#webco> how did you get it?
1082581442 [5502] <pam/#webco> we are coming down for a viewing
1082582062 [5508] <pam/#webco> thx
1082582141 [5512] <pam/#webco> damn, sorry
1082582157 [5516] <pam/#webco> i don't even look at the addresses
1082582568 [5526] <pam/#webco> damn csustan is getting a lot of errors, just reported another one
1082582666 [5528] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you think you can set up the instance for them tomorrow?  this error is actually trying to access a ck so it is blocking circulation of that order
1082582740 [5534] <pam/#webco> hehe
1082582775 [5538] <pam/#webco> hm, don't really remember 
1082582795 [5541] <pam/#webco> that is during the black period which i have blocked entirely from my memory
1082582830 [5545] <pam/#webco> yeah but it was also during a time when bugs weren't all that hard to come by
1082582843 [5549] <pam/#webco> riiiight
1082584007 [5572] <pam/#webco> hm
1082584922 [5576] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am not sure where that stmt leaves us
1082585630 [5589] <pam/#webco> i filed the academyart list of bugs
1082585981 [5595] <pam/#webco> thanks
1083084622 [6026] <pam/#webco> hiya
1083084751 [6030] <pam/#webco> miss me?
1083084881 [6034] <pam/#webco> i can leave again
1083084940 [6036] <pam/#webco> andrei from academyart just called, said he reported general speed problems yesterday and is advising that it is still going on today
1083084957 [6038] <pam/#webco> anything we can/have done about that or it's a drag em out and make em suffer campaign?
1083087632 [6054] <pam/#webco> i am trying to log into to academy art, it take a little longer than normal to bring me to the  log in page, once I enter admin id and password i get the following error
1083087634 [6056] <pam/#webco> zHTTP ERROR: 500 Internal Server Error
1083087634 [6058] <pam/#webco> RequestURI=//wco 
1083087637 [6060] <pam/#webco> ??
1083087671 [6062] <pam/#webco> is there something wrong with the admin log in or is there something wrong with the app?
1083087796 [6066] <pam/#webco> ok good, andrei just called too
1083087976 [6070] <pam/#webco> webcheckout.adcademyart.edu
1083088498 [6085] <pam/#webco> he is trying it but it is hanging, moving very slow
1083088543 [6087] <pam/#webco> still waiting 
1083088594 [6091] <pam/#webco> ok, off phone
1083089107 [6100] <pam/#webco> ok, pls let me know when it is back
1083089406 [6113] <pam/#webco> ok
1083089411 [6116] <pam/#webco> but they are pretty slow
1083089427 [6120] <pam/#webco> i am trying to make a reservation for one item and it is hung in updating start and end times
1083091989 [6127] <pam/#webco> academyart is still slow
1083092432 [6131] <pam/#webco> chapman is on the phone, they are down, getting a bad gateway error
1083092487 [6133] <pam/#webco> I just tried to tunnel in and it seems to just hang for me
1083092925 [6137] <pam/#webco> better now, thanks
1083094038 [6139] <pam/#webco> gracchus: chapman on phone again, they got the bad gateway error again and now it is hung up again
1083094068 [6145] <pam/#webco> so they are down again
1083094827 [6153] <pam/#webco> it is very very slow for me, im calling pete
1083095841 [6158] <pam/#webco> fsu is on phone
1083095846 [6160] <pam/#webco> weirdest call ever
1083096039 [6164] <pam/#webco> thier sysadmin calling to find out how they access the application, doesn't even know if/where the server is
1083096380 [6171] <pam/#webco> ok, so did you call them to correct that?
1083096689 [6175] <pam/#webco> so where did that leave things?
1083096702 [6177] <pam/#webco> this guy who called said they ahve been down for 2 weeks
1083096710 [6179] <pam/#webco> can we access them? 
1083096766 [6185] <pam/#webco> ok, well this guy seemed very clueless so I told him to locate the server at least and I assume he will call back and need to speak to you
1083096804 [6188] <pam/#webco> we can't access because we have the wrong ip or no idea why?
1083098280 [6205] <pam/#webco> refusenik: chapman is horribley slow now
1083098294 [6207] <pam/#webco> can we restart the application and the database? whatever we did for usc?
1083098343 [6209] <pam/#webco> i'll need to email pete if when we are going to take them down but it is basically just hanging anyway so I doubt it will matter
1083098559 [6213] <pam/#webco> ok, on phone with pete, go ahead and do now
1083098573 [6216] <pam/#webco> if this is working to speed things up then academayart should get a restart as well
1083098591 [6218] <pam/#webco> I will call andrei and larry and ask for a good time to bring them down
1083099032 [6230] <pam/#webco> academyart has been complaigning about speed for days and I have confirmed that they seem slow, if a restart helped usc and possibly chapman why not try it for academyart?
1083099474 [6235] <pam/#webco> but it was still slow
1083099548 [6237] <pam/#webco> joel from pec usc just called as well, he wants whatever you gave the other usc instance cause he has been slow as well, he said you can take him down now for a restart
1083099758 [6244] <pam/#webco> as for the academyart issue, I am not suggesting the restart as some kind of overall solution but something that may get them out of the general slowness they are experiencing now, if it works then that is great, if not then they are at least no worse off than they were before
1083101003 [6267] <pam/#webco> sorry, i mis read your perfectly clear statement
1083102149 [6273] <pam/#webco> arun from chapman is on the phone, he is still getting a bad gateway error
1083102342 [6277] <pam/#webco> does someone want to take this call? is there some information I can get from him to help with this?
1083102353 [6279] <pam/#webco> i do not get the bad gateway error
1083164670 [6338] <pam/#webco> we usually take everything through Pete
1083164702 [6340] <pam/#webco> you can get the goldroom main desk at 714 628 1400 i think
1083165098 [6342] <pam/#webco> is boris.onshored.com:8085 up to date for testing?
1083165630 [6354] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I use IE
1083165647 [6356] <pam/#webco> 5.2
1083165688 [6358] <pam/#webco> thanks for the update
1083166046 [6365] <pam/#webco> i don't see anything 
1083166052 [6367] <pam/#webco> in preferences
1083166243 [6369] <pam/#webco> can you turn on rrt for the testing instance pls?
1083166567 [6377] <pam/#webco> it does now or you just turned it on?
1083167015 [6395] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you pls try the restart of academyart such as you did for usc yesterday?
1083167034 [6397] <pam/#webco> now would be good, I cleared it through andrei
1083167570 [6408] <pam/#webco> artcenter is not working, i get log in page and then when I enter admin id and password I get an error, rik d just calle
1083167572 [6412] <pam/#webco> here is error
1083167580 [6414] <pam/#webco> Servlet thread failing with: Error in function IMHO::FIND-WM-IMPLEMENTATION: No implementation for method "process-form" on class #<Built-In-Class T {281BEE2D}><br> 
1083167643 [6416] <pam/#webco> someone pls look?
1083167886 [6427] <pam/#webco> no problem to restart them, they can't use it anyway
1083168347 [6441] <pam/#webco> academyart is back up and running noticeably faster
1083172706 [6450] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you see email from usc? can you respond?
1083174318 [6467] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i reopened 7188 for academyart unserliazed resource problem
1083175181 [6473] <pam/#webco> pls advise when that is complete and I will give you my opinion for the next priorityhh
1083176599 [6481] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you got new chapman problem for the ck you asked them to check? do you need a bug opened for that?
1083176753 [6486] <pam/#webco> oh, I thought that was the same ck, either way, can you take a look at the problem ck just reported to emergency support?
1083177064 [6493] <pam/#webco> that chapman error still comes up on the other url
1083177164 [6500] <pam/#webco> it is A point
1083177193 [6502] <pam/#webco> it's not that I think your request to have them use a different url is unimportant
1083179017 [6521] <pam/#webco> something still not working
1083179031 [6523] <pam/#webco> i tried a search for all allocation states ck6743 and got the same error
1083179040 [6525] <pam/#webco> Servlet thread failing with: Error in function COMMON-LISP::ASSERT-ERROR: Object argument to display-property is null.<br> 
1083179241 [6530] <pam/#webco> also, i serached for the patron he listed in his email and I get not results for him
1083179315 [6532] <pam/#webco> oh, he spelled it wrong, found patron
1083179343 [6536] <pam/#webco> but his activity log still gives the error too
1083179367 [6542] <pam/#webco> ok
1083181499 [6582] <pam/#webco> you could have just asked for a time in the same email 
1083181607 [6588] <pam/#webco> pete said you can do it in 10 min
1083181617 [6590] <pam/#webco> i called already
1083181817 [6598] <pam/#webco> no, you misunderstand i think
1083181826 [6600] <pam/#webco> not the testing boris instance, demo instance
1083182464 [6605] <pam/#webco> and the academyart data IS on demo right now and it should not be, it is not legal for us to put a clients data on our site 
1083182469 [6607] <pam/#webco> yes, more
1083182841 [6619] <pam/#webco> ok
1083183023 [6621] <pam/#webco> i gets no errors now
1083184487 [6625] <pam/#webco> we aren't into piles up here, well except for eric and his piles of old newspapers
1083184653 [6629] <pam/#webco> you mean dan?
1083184780 [6637] <pam/#webco> no, dan is a pile
1083184842 [6644] <pam/#webco> more cigarette making?
1083184879 [6652] <pam/#webco> the new ai module that makes cigarettes
1083257751 [6756] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you are working on 7188?
1083258132 [6762] <pam/#webco> i dont' really understand what that means
1083258875 [6768] <pam/#webco> k
1083260132 [6778] <pam/#webco> wow, it beeps!
1083264833 [6789] <pam/#webco> np
1083265814 [6797] <pam/#webco> hehe
1083267246 [6802] <pam/#webco> refusenik: chapman on phone, they are not printing, they beleive caused by the new url you gave them? i think that is wack?
1083267255 [6806] <pam/#webco> their queue is goldroom and host is blank
1083267688 [6808] <pam/#webco> refusenik: turns out to be mook error, shocking, but true
1083267697 [6810] <pam/#webco> they can print just fine from either url
1083268002 [6815] <pam/#webco> if i want to test printing on the recent build how do I configure the printer?  there is only a queue now? 
1083268030 [6817] <pam/#webco> should it work if I just put the IP of the printer there?
1083268144 [6825] <pam/#webco> o
1083268197 [6838] <pam/#webco> ok, will we run into problems for folks like accd and acadmeyart who I know setting up printing for them was a huge pain in the arse
1083268227 [6843] <pam/#webco> swell
1083268288 [6849] <pam/#webco> poop, ucla down, getting "Proxy Error

1083268418 [6861] <pam/#webco> will using 'printer' on boris print to 2nd floor printer?
1083268622 [6865] <pam/#webco> i would really like that, when you have a chance
1083270455 [6871] <pam/#webco> do you need to explain to them why they should not reboot?  or my being your puppet is fine? cause if it requires more explaination I would prefer you to respond to their email
1083274256 [6902] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you advise on angie from ucla's question pls
1083274809 [6910] <pam/#webco> it is now :)
1083274952 [6912] <pam/#webco> refusenik: gotten any where on getting csustan instance up?
1083275123 [6922] <pam/#webco> which bug?
1083275769 [6944] <pam/#webco> that does make sense, altho maybe a distinction between a resource that was never on an allocation can be deleted? in case something is entered in error?
1083275803 [6948] <pam/#webco> altho I have to say that now is not a good time to embark on changing this entire functionality
1083275823 [6952] <pam/#webco> there has to be a way that they system used to handle such cases or no?
1083277251 [6960] <pam/#webco> must get to the bank, see you tomorrow
1083338597 [7020] <pam/#webco> refusenik: csustan set up?
1083338889 [7034] <pam/#webco> ??
1083338926 [7036] <pam/#webco> does your irc not show when someone logs on? if you said something before I logged on to the channel two min ago you were talking to yourself
1083339087 [7045] <pam/#webco> ok, can you answer the question then?
1083339198 [7049] <pam/#webco> is csustan instance set up?>
1083339297 [7055] <pam/#webco> how long do youthink?
1083339420 [7061] <pam/#webco> ok
1083339435 [7063] <pam/#webco> mmmm coffee
1083343069 [7074] <pam/#onshored> joshy!!
1083348369 [7082] <pam/#webco> sure
1083348387 [7086] <pam/#webco> it is a way to over-ride the length of the allocation as the base for the usage fee
1083348405 [7088] <pam/#webco> so you can make an allocation for an entire weekend but just charge for 10 hours 
1083348950 [7092] <pam/#webco> oy
1083348975 [7094] <pam/#webco> how much longer you think?
1083365337 [7142] <pam/#onshored> kristine!
1083365648 [7147] <pam/#onshored> i have to skate outta here
1083365670 [7153] <pam/#onshored> kristine: call me if you would like to come tonight and josh is being lame and you need a ride
1083365679 [7157] <pam/#onshored> o, hi josh
1083365714 [7167] <pam/#onshored> yes, cat puke is a very tempting alternative
1083365740 [7173] <pam/#onshored> is everyones cat puking today?
1083365756 [7178] <pam/#onshored> that is a lot of puke
1083365763 [7184] <pam/#onshored> puke is a great word
1083365798 [7190] <pam/#onshored> my cat puked last night, altho i don't know which one
1083365806 [7199] <pam/#onshored> gross
1083365824 [7203] <pam/#onshored> the best is the late night hallway to the bathroom puke
1083365830 [7205] <pam/#onshored> i think they do that one on purpose
1083365882 [7211] <pam/#onshored> ew, pleasant
1083365916 [7215] <pam/#onshored> ok, really must go, hope to see both of you lame-O-s later
1083600792 [7519] <pam/#webco> refusenik: on  bug 7188 for unseralized resources I need a clairifiction pls
1083600825 [7521] <pam/#webco> when you say they don't appear in the timeline do you mean they don't pull in a schedule to appear in the timeline or they don't appear at all?
1083600982 [7527] <pam/#webco> right, that is they way it used to work anyway
1083600995 [7531] <pam/#webco> thanks
1083601308 [7535] <pam/#webco> yes, thanks
1083601316 [7538] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what is up with csustan instance?
1083601337 [7540] <pam/#webco> the one hour job has turned into two days and it makes a me sad
1083601542 [7545] <pam/#webco> what
1083601552 [7547] <pam/#webco> are the problems
1083601687 [7559] <pam/#webco> ok, so how long do you think we are talking about now?
1083602317 [7577] <pam/#webco> no
1083602329 [7580] <pam/#webco> they are not for you so why worry about
1083602353 [7583] <pam/#webco> they are for jane and i to have meetings to make sure we are moving along and have a good expectation for completion
1083602366 [7585] <pam/#webco> so no worries
1083602438 [7590] <pam/#webco> they are cc'd there for a record of the support 
1083602449 [7592] <pam/#webco> just ignore them
1083602994 [7598] <pam/#webco> refusenik: pls let me know when you are done with csustan, i really need you back on academyart issues
1083603022 [7603] <pam/#webco> really????
1083603035 [7611] <pam/#webco> yes, i can give prioritys
1083603061 [7618] <pam/#webco> gracchus if you could take 7246 that would be great
1083603121 [7624] <pam/#webco> refusenik: if you could take 7248 that would be great
1083603181 [7631] <pam/#webco> i would really like to get the rest of these aac items done and then lock down a build as the release so I can do a testing sweep, then we can just clean up the nec. ones i find and get them a new release next week
1083603212 [7635] <pam/#webco> heart sores
1083603271 [7641] <pam/#webco> hehe, yep
1083603314 [7645] <pam/#webco> refusenik: also, academyart is back to being sluggish again so I would like to schedule and restart for them again
1083603445 [7653] <pam/#webco> yes, i know, which is fine but he is out today and said he would learn it too
1083603452 [7656] <pam/#webco> so maybe we can go over it tomorrow
1083603468 [7658] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i tried but their ordering system was down on friday, i will try again
1083603621 [7669] <pam/#webco> yeah, since he is out, that way I won't forget
1083609906 [7682] <pam/#webco> refusnik: on phone with academyart they can go down now for restart, is ok for you?
1083610686 [7694] <pam/#webco> thanks
1083612389 [7698] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did you pick up 7246?
1083612479 [7702] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1083612659 [7717] <pam/#webco> hehe, ok
1083612819 [7721] <pam/#webco> no, tomorrow
1083612839 [7725] <pam/#webco> boris is up to date for testing?
1083612863 [7727] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what ever happened to cusstan restore?
1083613210 [7746] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i can try, he may be on a plane already
1083613259 [7748] <pam/#webco> yeah, no luck
1083613276 [7752] <pam/#webco> since one is already approved I can do that and do another tomorrow if he gives the ok, will that help?
1083613960 [7769] <pam/#webco> gracchus: how urgent to get hardware, groud is $14, 2nd day $18 and next day $29
1083613975 [7771] <pam/#onshored> freaky
1083613993 [7774] <pam/#onshored> what is the address?
1083614078 [7776] <pam/#webco> split the difference with 2nd day ok?
1083614138 [7782] <pam/#webco> hm, next day it is then
1083614303 [7792] <pam/#webco> damn this tiger direct site
1083615636 [7815] <pam/#webco> why?
1083615642 [7817] <pam/#webco> what new topic?
1083615662 [7819] <pam/#webco> finally got tiger direct order to go through, huge pain in the arse
1083615718 [7826] <pam/#webco> i see topic set by gracchus 4/30
1083615741 [7832] <pam/#webco> details details
1083615818 [7837] <pam/#webco> there are no resource types/resources in the applet
1083616006 [7845] <pam/#webco> shat
1083616008 [7847] <pam/#webco> wgat
1083616010 [7850] <pam/#webco> what
1083616111 [7866] <pam/#webco> how long will it be down? couple min? if so, i would bet no one there would notice
1083616297 [7879] <pam/#webco> i have filed that
1083616726 [7887] <pam/#webco> that is better
1083616734 [7889] <pam/#webco> they would access using same address?'
1083616737 [7891] <pam/#webco> ok to forward to them?
1083616769 [7894] <pam/#onshored> those photos are amazing!
1083616856 [7904] <pam/#onshored> the color is so vivid
1083616985 [7918] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you have usage fees turned on on the tesing instance, they should have the ability to invoice but not usage fees
1083617781 [7954] <pam/#webco> i need to leave at 4 today, gordon left his wallet in my car and he needs it, doh
1083618152 [7967] <pam/#webco> refusenik: still need me to verify? whose data are you using?
1083618304 [7971] <pam/#webco> poor boris
1083618350 [7973] <pam/#webco> 7248 still seems valid on 1955
1083618405 [7975] <pam/#webco> could you not recreate?
1083618862 [7979] <pam/#webco> ok, maybe I can get a new build to test on tomorrow?
1083618888 [7991] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you pick up 7211 instead then pls?
1083619282 [7996] <pam/#webco> ok, going to go
1083689244 [8091] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what bug are you working on now?
1083689315 [8095] <pam/#webco> ok
1083689822 [8099] <pam/#webco> refusenik: fyi, pls leave the portland email, dan wants to respond
1083691630 [8119] <pam/#webco> sure
1083691664 [8123] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did you ever get 7246? if you can't get it then I will ask craig to do that next
1083691673 [8125] <pam/#webco> refusenik: great
1083691929 [8131] <pam/#webco> that you fixed csu allocation
1083691970 [8135] <pam/#webco> i am attempting to duplicate a resource and when I change the resource ID of the duplicate and hit save the system is just spinning, been waiting well over  a min now for response
1083692048 [8141] <pam/#webco> there it goes, finally
1083692375 [8147] <pam/#webco> refusenik: 7211 seems good and fixed now
1083692428 [8149] <pam/#webco> jesse: if you can that would be great
1083692491 [8151] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you take 7260 next? should be a nice and easy one
1083692706 [8157] <pam/#webco> is what a joke
1083692768 [8162] <pam/#webco> its not a joke, it makes it very difficult to use those fields which are very important if you happen to be a worker bee in one of these large schools
1083692985 [8166] <pam/#webco> plus we have a set list for academyart which needs to get knocked out and then we can finally lock down a build and do a final bug sweep, fix so we have something that is releasable
1083693027 [8170] <pam/#webco> we have gotten all the major ones for them with jesse getting 7246 so the next couple of ones are fairly minor and should be quick and easy, i hope
1083697339 [8236] <pam/#onshored> kristine: when kippur was really really sick and not eating the vet told me to feed him baby food through a seringe/eye dropper type thing
1083697682 [8247] <pam/#onshored> he did manage to keep the baby food down but it was after he was sick for awhile and had stopped eating altogether
1083697706 [8253] <pam/#onshored> yeah, that is really bad, she can get dehydrated quickly
1083697732 [8255] <pam/#onshored> it was not set days, I just did it until he started eating on his own again
1083697750 [8259] <pam/#onshored> i am not sure if it would stay down when nothing else will
1083698318 [8269] <pam/#onshored> see you soon, yay
1083699100 [8276] <pam/#webco> can i get the latest build updated to boris for testing pls
1083699630 [8286] <pam/#webco> thanks
1083699802 [8291] <pam/#webco> thanks
1083699861 [8294] <pam/#webco> what is the url again, can't seem to remember the numbers
1083700440 [8339] <pam/#webco> ahh, 8085, i was so close
1083700479 [8343] <pam/#webco> when i enter the admin id and pword i get HTTP ERROR: 500 Internal Server Error
1083700479 [8345] <pam/#webco> RequestURI=/wco 
1083700680 [8382] <pam/#webco> yes
1083701274 [8425] <pam/#webco> so did we get rid of the rrt drop down box where you can select a resource other than the proposed one?  i thought we were just turning that off for chapman?  i think some other schools will need that feature
1083702324 [8440] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you are on 7260 right?
1083702987 [8446] <pam/#webco> is jesse still here?
1083770247 [8609] <pam/#webco> morning
1083770439 [8618] <pam/#webco> yay yay yay
1083770449 [8620] <pam/#webco> hugs jesse and craig
1083770470 [8626] <pam/#webco> photo department at academyart
1083770475 [8628] <pam/#webco> nope, just them
1083770488 [8632] <pam/#webco> afaik
1083770607 [8636] <pam/#webco> in reference to what happened to chapman last night, getting stuck in the debugger, cut me some slack here cause I do not know what that really means, but is that "turned on", if so, does it have to be and will turning it off keep things like that from happening?
1083770850 [8652] <pam/#webco> ah, ok, thanks
1083770970 [8656] <pam/#webco> refusenik: a request came in from baylor to change a couple of invoices they accidentially paid that should have been waived instead.  We have done this a number of time for them in the past, have you ever done it and if so do you know how long it would take you to fix two of the invoices for them?
1083771069 [8661] <pam/#webco> the current build is 179 this morning and testing instance is 174, can i get an update pls?
1083771139 [8667] <pam/#webco> because they have a version in which the functionality doesn't match up to the accepted accounting practive
1083771162 [8670] <pam/#webco> they are on 3.0.5 in which paying an invoice closes it and you can not reopen and make adjusting entries
1083771175 [8676] <pam/#webco> reopening is a 3.1 feature
1083771198 [8680] <pam/#webco> do you have any kind of estimate you can give me
1083771227 [8683] <pam/#webco> i hate to not have you working on bugs but I also don't want to leave them hanging if it truly is something you can knock out quickly
1083771382 [8687] <pam/#webco> doh
1083771620 [8693] <pam/#webco> that is not bad then, do you think you could knock that out sometime between now and friday?
1083771647 [8699] <pam/#webco> it is bug 7276
1083771768 [8707] <pam/#webco> also, then next academyart bug on their list is 7268, a requested change to their print agreement form which, if i understand the new one correctly, should be quite easy
1083772053 [8713] <pam/#webco> i thought they had it
1083772055 [8720] <pam/#webco> no?
1083772196 [8724] <pam/#webco> they only have the Printer queue line on their admin general settings tab so I thought that would mean they have the new print form
1083773857 [8736] <pam/#webco> can i get an updated build on boris pls
1083774091 [8743] <pam/#webco> gracchus: ucla bug 7232 has been reopened by chris dutton, is it that this fix did not work or am I right in assuming that he is working on a release that does not have this fix
1083774258 [8750] <pam/#webco> sweet, thanks
1083774263 [8752] <pam/#webco> to both
1083774659 [8760] <pam/#webco> yep, goin down baby
1083774694 [8762] <pam/#webco> i would love to get close to a 'tagged' version by end of day so we can do a good testing sweep at circulation
1083774707 [8764] <pam/#webco> and then update academyart early next week
1083774796 [8768] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i am trying to tunnel to usc-pec and i get the following: ssh: usc-pec: Name or service not known
1083774797 [8771] <pam/#webco> support@prep:~$ 
1083775039 [8778] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you know what is up with that?
1083775676 [8785] <pam/#webco> ok, after my review the crit/blocker number and some more closures since yesterday the number is at 7, go boys go 
1083775999 [8802] <pam/#webco> thx
1083778089 [8845] <pam/#webco> refusenik: 7268
1083778190 [8847] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did you say you fixed the jumping screen problem?  there is a bug for that which can be closed if that is the case, 7217
1083778317 [8849] <pam/#webco> can i get a new build for boris for testing pls pls pls
1083778560 [8861] <pam/#webco> thanks
1083779614 [8865] <pam/#webco> i found a bug that may be simple but could potentially cause problems for academyart, so made it a crit, feel free to disagree
1083780553 [8874] <pam/#webco> hm, ups? what just got delivered?
1083780572 [8876] <pam/#webco> nervermind
1083784937 [8888] <pam/#webco> poor csu
1083784942 [8890] <pam/#webco> stan
1083785323 [8895] <pam/#webco> i am at a loss here, csustan keeps running into these errors on their production instance, blockers for them, but with our current timeline for everything else where does this get prioritized?
1083785350 [8897] <pam/#webco> wait, refusenik, you said something yesterday about fixing something with an order that was giving an error for them on the testing instance, right?
1083785403 [8901] <pam/#webco> i think that is releated to what keeps stopping them up
1083785426 [8907] <pam/#webco> but it is manifesting on the next allocation for the resource that is on the allocation you fixed
1083785434 [8909] <pam/#webco> could they be related?
1083785489 [8922] <pam/#webco> sure, if that will help
1083785592 [8929] <pam/#webco> checking for same problem on the test instance, does not happen there
1083785796 [8937] <pam/#webco> is the incompletely defined usage fee thing addressed in the build they have for testing or it will just continue to happen? they don't have usage fees module btw
1083785851 [8939] <pam/#webco> isn't there already a bug for that?
1083786046 [8947] <pam/#webco> pls don't tell me to go read cruisecontrol when I ask you a question about something, i don't know ccontrol or what you use it for so unless you want to spend a bunch of time telling me and showing me what it is....you would probably just be better off answering my questions
1083786261 [8955] <pam/#webco> there is a bug with that error in it but it subject line is csustan has duplicate allocation ids after migration, would that be a different bug?
1083786271 [8961] <pam/#onshored> kristine!!
1083786275 [8964] <pam/#onshored> how is the kitty?
1083786302 [8973] <pam/#onshored> o, so good to hear
1083786319 [8977] <pam/#webco> 7228
1083786340 [8979] <pam/#onshored> eating and keeping it down?
1083786468 [8994] <pam/#webco> ok, pls to update
1083786508 [8998] <pam/#webco> since the errors do not exist on the testing instance does that mean it has been addressed or it just hasn't manifested yet?
1083786541 [9010] <pam/#onshored> that is good news, maybe she just had a werid virus or ate something bad
1083786748 [9016] <pam/#webco> refusenik: the vote is to have you move to the csustan problem since they are in production and blocked by this error, pls advise if you think we should update them to build 174 that they have a testing instance on or if you can fix this error for them on their current production instance
1083786788 [9018] <pam/#webco> also, the correction you made to their order 882 was on the testing instance so the error on that order still exists for them on the production instance
1083787727 [9035] <pam/#webco> refusenik: they do not have the usage fee module so should not have ANY incremental usage fees
1083787817 [9045] <pam/#webco> ok, but you can't say 'review their incremental usage fees' if they dont' have usage fee, do you see my confusion?
1083788020 [9057] <pam/#webco> well, I just checked and usage fee module is turned on on their production instance and it should not be
1083788064 [9059] <pam/#webco> I have said several times that they do not have usage fee module
1083788086 [9063] <pam/#webco> there used to be some way that josh/lee whoever kept track of what modules a client had/should have
1083788089 [9065] <pam/#webco> is there not anymore?
1083788135 [9075] <pam/#webco> well, I am not a liar, it was set up  incorrectly
1083788169 [9077] <pam/#webco> well we need something that works cause my saying it over and over again on irc doesn't seem to work either 
1083788233 [9080] <pam/#webco> what happens is we shut off the usage fee module on their production instance?
1083788247 [9082] <pam/#webco> will this make the error magically disappear?
1083788366 [9091] <pam/#webco> sure, will there be any disruption to them?
1083788486 [9095] <pam/#webco> ok, i have left a msg for james, he will call me when he gets back and we can go from there
1083788627 [9117] <pam/#webco> o my goodness, i turned off the usage fee policy on the resource type for the resource on the problem allocation and the errors went away!
1083788655 [9121] <pam/#webco> please do
1083788672 [9123] <pam/#webco> so, if the config files says its off and it ain't..........
1083790032 [9143] <pam/#webco> sure
1083790054 [9145] <pam/#webco> yay, all good
1083790146 [9178] <pam/#webco> all good now, no error, so nice
1083790332 [9205] <pam/#webco> all the csustan errors have gone away now, i am going to close their 3 remaining bugs
1083791478 [9241] <pam/#webco> sure, he means items that are contained by a container resource, the contained resources all should list on the print agreement as well as the main container piece.  He needs both the resource type name and resource id of the contained pieces, just the resource ID is not enough
1083791480 [9243] <pam/#webco> does that help?
1083792470 [9298] <pam/#webco> of course we would put in a trapeze, where did you think dan was going to sit?
1083792724 [9305] <pam/#webco> its so tall, we could build lofts for additional space
1083793301 [9309] <pam/#webco> maybe jesse can advise, it should be something we can add in for those clients who need it, I thought jesse said we could customize for every client if need be but def. the components need to be there cause it is part of the accd customization
1083795373 [9329] <pam/#webco> refusenik: if jesse is going to get that one for academyart then the last one on their little list is 7250
1083795545 [9332] <pam/#webco> time to gogo
1083862005 [9411] <pam/#webco> refusenik: what bug are you working on?
1083862024 [9415] <pam/#webco> boris testing is on 181 and current build is 185, can i get an update so i can go bug hunting pls?
1083862969 [9421] <pam/#webco> oh, i thought jesse said he was going to do it cause it was quick for him
1083864696 [9431] <pam/#webco> gracchus: 7246 is not working correctly, do you want to come look at my screen so I can explain it more clearly?
1083864774 [9437] <pam/#webco> hm, also 7252 not fixed, maybe a commit didn't make it into a build or something?
1083866289 [9444] <pam/#webco> pretty little applet
1083868787 [9456] <pam/#webco> hm, bummer, i think repeats are wacked
1083869363 [9462] <pam/#webco> actually not as bad as I thought
1083869464 [9466] <pam/#webco> it looks like 7005 does not happen but the interface is still not correct, i just opened a new bug b/f seeing your comment, should I leave both open or close 7005 and leave it with the new bug?
1083869521 [9468] <pam/#webco> well, ill leave them both open and you close once you have corrected, or ill close, just let me knwo
1083871570 [9474] <pam/#webco> refusenik: you still working on getting contents on the print agreement form?
1083871620 [9478] <pam/#webco> don't mean to be a pain but I thought the new form design was such that it is supposed to be 'easy' to add fields/make changes
1083872291 [9485] <pam/#webco> ok, i am going to apologize in advance for being a pain but here goes anyway, if we are tying to hit a deadline of an updated release to academyart early next week, very aggressive, wouldn't it make more sense to have jesse fix that bug and have craig work on another one where he won't have to spend a good chunck of time learning a new piece of code or system?
1083873229 [9490] <pam/#webco> ok
1083876504 [9504] <pam/#webco> well, you two decide which is better but if it is faster for jesse to do then he gets my vote and we can move you onto something else
1083876796 [9507] <pam/#webco> yay, closing two crits
1083876809 [9511] <pam/#webco> gracchus: other repeat blocker bug is no longer happening now
1083876972 [9513] <pam/#webco> i did bump an applet bug that has been driving me nuts, feel free to knock it back down if too  much of a pain in the arse
1083877493 [9518] <pam/#webco> well poop, unserialized resources still not working correctly
1083877740 [9525] <pam/#webco> if you make two reservations for the same unserialized resource at the same time, all is good, no errors or warning, but when you try to pick one of them up it gives the intervening allocation error at the top of the screen
1083877751 [9528] <pam/#webco> i reopened 7188
1083877941 [9536] <pam/#webco> um, I also just looked at the usage tab of the unserialized resource I was using and there are duplicate cks, it looks like two of each of the orders I made, weird werid
1083878022 [9540] <pam/#webco> seems like an interface issue on the usage tab
1083880311 [9549] <pam/#webco> woo hoo
1083880699 [9553] <pam/#webco> gracchus: could you take a look at bug 7286 and let me know your opinion about fixing in this release or waiting, pls
1083880726 [9560] <pam/#webco> it is confusing for the user but I am not conviced it would come up that often
1083942016 [9600] <pam/#webco> i would love to get boris with academyart or chapman data, possible?
1083942281 [9611] <pam/#webco> lets go for chapman
1083942313 [9615] <pam/#webco> well, you know what if I can have both, lets have academyart data on an instance that has rrt turned off and one with chapman with it on, is that doable?
1083942344 [9623] <pam/#webco> sweet
1083945580 [9659] <pam/#webco> there really aren't that many cause it's looking goo-oo-ood
1083947301 [9670] <pam/#webco> reminder that I am leaving at 130 today to catch a flight
1083947505 [9677] <pam/#webco> nice try
1083947634 [9682] <pam/#webco> i would like to give academyart a testing instance for new build by end of day monday, any objections?
1083948257 [9700] <pam/#webco> ok, off to hunt i go
1083948378 [9707] <pam/#webco> ok
1083948696 [9719] <pam/#webco> craigl: csustan is having emailing problems, they say they are not getting emails from webcheckout, i changed James's email to mine and I got an email just fine, does this make sense in the world of webcheckout email?  that is somehow just not going through to csu.edu emails? 
1083948827 [9728] <pam/#webco> and if they do see their mail in there? it is their sysadmin problem?
1083948839 [9732] <pam/#webco> ok
1083948840 [9734] <pam/#webco> thanks
1083949148 [9748] <pam/#webco> already sent mail, pls review and let me know if I need to give them more info than I did
1083949795 [9761] <pam/#webco> hm should I wait for the build jesse is talking about?
1083949820 [9765] <pam/#webco> ok
1083949901 [9774] <pam/#webco> ok
1083951578 [9791] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i am on build 190, the applet is giving me some trouble highlighting a resource type to check the view avail window, if I choose a resource type that is unavailable it seems the next time I try to highlight it won't let me
1083951712 [9795] <pam/#webco> also, i requested a status of a checkout from the timeline and it seems stuck in the status bar now, I don't  have the build that includes the status bar fix, maybe i should wait on that one and retest?
1083952044 [9805] <pam/#webco> should the box for items unavailable for immediate pick up show up before a reservation is committed?
1083952274 [9816] <pam/#webco> yeah, it's not a bad idea except that the text under ther resource says Unavailalbe:  Currently overdue in checkout: CK-4989, due back at 12:00 PM, 5/7/2004.  The word unavailable will immediately freak users out
1083952374 [9825] <pam/#webco> i am going to vote to not have that on there in this release so I am going to file a bug on it
1083953596 [9843] <pam/#webco> can someone please make the error witch go away? it is very disruptive, especially when dan is on the phone
1083954160 [9852] <pam/#webco> not really important for right now, but someday
1083954991 [9855] <pam/#webco> time to go to detroit, woo
1084202308 [10016] <pam/#webco> testing instances are on build 190 and current build is 200, can I get them updated pls?
1084202422 [10020] <pam/#webco> thanks
1084202497 [10022] <pam/#webco> yay, down to two crits!
1084204569 [10031] <pam/#webco> uh oh, renewal blocker bug is back, poop
1084204677 [10033] <pam/#webco> 7215 reopened
1084204914 [10038] <pam/#webco> and we are back to two
1084206718 [10053] <pam/#webco> we still on track to get testing instance for academyart by end of the day?
1084206734 [10056] <pam/#webco> will need those two open bugs resolved
1084207128 [10062] <pam/#webco> usc on the phone, jason restarted cause things started to slow down there and noticed that the postgresql was having some issue before retstarting, he wants to know if the restart will help that or if it only restarts the lisp code
1084207173 [10067] <pam/#webco> pls help, he is on the phone now
1084207296 [10075] <pam/#webco> ok, i just got off the phone with him, he says the postgres is running at 97% and was wondering if we could restart that for him?
1084207670 [10088] <pam/#webco> gracchus: there is something not quite right with the applet status bar, i wonder if I should open new bug or reopen the one you just closed for them not being there at all
1084207693 [10093] <pam/#webco> the errors pop back up after you add a patron or choose a resource
1084207707 [10097] <pam/#webco> for a little time and then go away again
1084207888 [10101] <pam/#webco> i also moved 7079 to critical
1084207987 [10103] <pam/#webco> since it did not get addressed in 7044
1084210120 [10110] <pam/#webco> so when we give academyart a testing instance are we going to tag that build as the release and any fixes we find in their testing are going to be made to that build?
1084210301 [10115] <pam/#webco> good good
1084212904 [10127] <pam/#webco> wonderful, thanks, we need to make sure we update it with the rest of the fixes we can get in today
1084213147 [10136] <pam/#webco> when we branch a release to academyart we will still need to make fixes to it for the bugs they find in testing won't we? or is that not how it is going to work now?
1084213330 [10143] <pam/#webco> ok
1084214567 [10148] <pam/#webco> yayayayayayayay the ck #s for repeats is back on the interface correctly instead of listing them as intervening allocations
1084214573 [10150] <pam/#webco> dances a jig
1084215182 [10161] <pam/#webco> if that is too hairy i think we can move that off to the next release
1084215362 [10177] <pam/#webco> of this i have no doubt
1084215426 [10183] <pam/#webco> gracchus: do you know if the fix that does not allow a resource from a different checkout center on an allocation is supposed to be in build 200?
1084215442 [10186] <pam/#webco> oh wait, i see it, nevermind
1084217634 [10202] <pam/#webco> yay!
1084217665 [10204] <pam/#webco> if you could get the applet status bar thing next that would be good, having the error hang around seems to slow the applet down when trying to pull up the resource types the first time
1084219029 [10218] <pam/#webco> after the applet one is fixed I would like to get an update to boris 8085 so I can take another swing at major circulation and then if all ok an update to the academyart testing instance and then I will email the site to them
1084219682 [10229] <pam/#webco> and only one on the 3.1 milestone, wooooooo
1084220741 [10237] <pam/#webco> can i get an update to boris so I can take a final swing b/f we upate academyart?
1084220746 [10241] <pam/#webco> things are looking good!
1084221305 [10251] <pam/#webco> thanks
1084221435 [10253] <pam/#webco> hm, i don't see the unathorized icon in the applet, should that be included?
1084221440 [10255] <pam/#webco> in this build
1084222388 [10270] <pam/#webco> nope, don't see it, it mush not be in the build
1084222455 [10276] <pam/#webco> oh, no, ill try that
1084222996 [10283] <pam/#webco> so pretty
1084223129 [10287] <pam/#webco> like a new penny
1084224091 [10293] <pam/#webco> circulation is looking really solid, have not found any problems, can i get an update to the academyart staged testing instance so I can email them pls?
1084224835 [10311] <pam/#webco> ok, pls let me know when it is avail
1084225144 [10320] <pam/#webco> thank you
1084293631 [10465] <pam/#webco> craigl: ellen from ithaca has requested we stop the process running on their instance, a very large usage report, can you do that?
1084293748 [10471] <pam/#webco> thanks
1084297967 [10481] <pam/#webco> rrt is not working, just filed blocker
1084298282 [10494] <pam/#webco> no, it chapman, 8084
1084298304 [10496] <pam/#webco> filed bug 7296
1084298568 [10502] <pam/#webco> ew, something weird just happened, adding to bug 7296
1084298581 [10504] <pam/#webco> hm, maybe differnt bug
1084298626 [10506] <pam/#webco> i removed one item on the order that would not commit using rrt and tried to commit again, the order committed, it gave me ck# but removed all resources/types from the order.  So I get a confirmed ck with error that says no resource or resource types selected
1084298635 [10508] <pam/#webco> i gonna go with differnt
1084298638 [10512] <pam/#webco> bug
1084299380 [10552] <pam/#webco> rapid return with multiple bar codes is nice
1084299405 [10557] <pam/#webco> i like the sounds webco makes very much too
1084299487 [10565] <pam/#webco> does demo have rrt turned on?
1084299498 [10567] <pam/#webco> if so, it should wait
1084299793 [10575] <pam/#webco> ithaca is down
1084300542 [10592] <pam/#webco> do i have to file a bug to have the annoying wicked witch audio you get when an error comes up removed? does it do that at our clients?
1084300645 [10597] <pam/#webco> how about none?
1084301242 [10602] <pam/#webco> no problem with that
1084301262 [10604] <pam/#webco> craigl: i just restarted academyart without even buggin you, aren't you happy
1084301326 [10612] <pam/#webco> o thank you
1084313936 [10666] <pam/#webco> that would be me
1084313945 [10672] <pam/#webco> which bug
1084313978 [10682] <pam/#webco> ok, jesse, i get the point
1084313991 [10684] <pam/#webco> i will log with more info
1084314121 [10693] <pam/#webco> the data is from last week sometime 
1084375104 [10778] <pam/#webco> hey ho
1084375116 [10780] <pam/#webco> kristine starts today!  you boys be really nice to her ;)
1084375339 [10796] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did my additional notes on 7296 help at all?
1084376490 [10810] <pam/#webco> craigl: yeah, i have a whole list of stuff to give kristine, if you can think of anything feel free to let me know cause I may have missed something
1084377252 [10818] <pam/#webco> craigl: you have thermostat on the second floor, if you are cold maybe you should turn it down?
1084380748 [10824] <pam/#webco> craigl or gracchus: can one of you respond to eric's question yesterday about getting saic a test instance so we can get back to alex please?
1084384981 [10830] <pam/#webco> gracchus: academyart has complained in the past about having a resource appear available in the view avail window and then when they add it to the order the system says it is unavailable.  I had not been able to recreate altho i tried several times and I just got it to happen.  I am unsure how to log this with any kind of recipe that could be reproduced easily by a developer, do you want to see this on my screen now?
1084384995 [10832] <pam/#webco> or do you just want me to file the bug and advise that it will be very hard to repro
1084392101 [10849] <pam/#webco> why why why does there have to be a .wav file when hitting a bug, silence is golden
1084392388 [10859] <pam/#webco> if by exciting you mean annoying
1084392419 [10861] <pam/#webco> its 8085 that has audio on it
1084465026 [10943] <pam/#webco> refusenik: yeah, sorry you're sick
1084465055 [10947] <pam/#webco> (kristine is pam at the moment)
1084465132 [10955] <pam/#webco> heh
1084465187 [10957] <pam/#webco> did you see the emergency email from Frank Tate at MSU?
1084465231 [10961] <pam/#webco> cool. 
1084465705 [10973] <pam/#webco> i don't know the password anyway
1084465778 [10980] <pam/#webco> i've got one for demo and one other test instance on boris
1084466338 [10984] <pam/#webco> ok, pam is pam again
1084466517 [10992] <pam/#webco> i don't see any mail from frank, o, is that the call on support line?
1084466620 [11004] <pam/#webco> oh, this is a known problem and an easy answer for frank
1084466645 [11009] <pam/#webco> there are two "deliver to" options in the drop down, bug filed, one works just fine, one gives an error
1084466656 [11012] <pam/#webco> i will advise mr tate
1084466974 [11018] <pam/#webco> ok, response to frank sent
1084467772 [11026] <pam/#webco> gracchus: can I get you to open up a data port so kristine can get her laptop on line?
1084467789 [11030] <pam/#webco> 0311A is where she is hooked up
1084467909 [11038] <pam/#webco> thanks
1084468517 [11055] <pam/#webco> i have a new blocker on the academyart instance so I am going to file, that version that was released to them was 'tagged' or something so now this fix will go to the code they have right? 
1084468685 [11065] <pam/#webco> she is working on her laptop settings, will advise 
1084468828 [11067] <pam/#webco> filed 7304
1084468837 [11072] <pam/#webco> yay, kristine is all good, thanks jesse
1084468988 [11075] <pam/#webco> is there some way I can get kristine an onshored.com email address and sign her up to the support list?
1084469062 [11077] <pam/#webco> found the subscribe to support page so I can handle that, I am going to sign her up using her current email address but I will still need someone to show me how to set up her onshored email
1084471338 [11095] <pam/#webco> i have a call from the university of Utah, he is asking about what files need to be backed up
1084471344 [11097] <pam/#webco> what can i tell him?
1084471689 [11104] <pam/#webco> sorry, it took too long so I asked him to email in
1084472501 [11119] <pam/#webco> msu seems hung up on something, gracchus, can you check it out pls?
1084472605 [11121] <pam/#webco> or refusenik if you can
1084472674 [11127] <pam/#webco> hello?
1084472711 [11133] <pam/#webco> oh, refusenik responded by mail, nevermind jesse
1084472763 [11139] <pam/#webco> refusenik: it would be helpful to me if when you pick up a support issue that you just give a quick "got msu" or something in irce
1084473228 [11152] <pam/#webco> pls do
1084482569 [11227] <pam/#webco> hm, it appears there was some kind of craig b special on academyart that no one knew about
1084482584 [11229] <pam/#webco> their user ids come from peoplesoft with a 0 
1084482596 [11231] <pam/#webco> in front of the numbers they use on barcodes 
1084482629 [11233] <pam/#webco> so i think craig b did something where the patron box on the applet drops the first character of the ID when it is looking for a match
1084482632 [11235] <pam/#webco> does that make sense?
1084482986 [11243] <pam/#webco> doh
1084483027 [11247] <pam/#webco> uhhh, i would want to give them a testing instance first maybe?  academyart has been testing a couple of days and have found no new circulation problems
1084483048 [11252] <pam/#webco> well, I take that back, there is one I filed today that has to do with pins blocking circulation, that needs to be fixed first
1084483061 [11254] <pam/#webco> what do you think about a testing instance for them?
1084483098 [11258] <pam/#webco> with the same build as academyart?
1084483101 [11260] <pam/#webco> do they use pin numbers?
1084483255 [11271] <pam/#webco> well I would say get them on the tagged version academyart is using, find out if they use pin numbers and ask for a little testing b/f updating?
1084483488 [11283] <pam/#webco> then I don't know what to say, will the changes made post release to academyart affect any other parts of the system? does this require another round of circulation testing?
1084483863 [11290] <pam/#webco> then i would need a new testing instance with usc data, an extra day between now and monday and then maybe we could update them by then :)
1084484031 [11306] <pam/#webco> here is the problem, and I will defer to eric on this, but even if I test usc instance all day tomorrow any bugs I find will have to jump the priority list we currently have for getting academyart new instance installed, chapman testing instance rrt problems fixed and getting them a testing update
1084547782 [11502] <pam/#webco> eric saw another space at the ravenswood spot and likes it very very much, it is an L shape so we can partition off really easily the space between me/dan/eric and jesse/craig, yay yay yay
1084547810 [11505] <pam/#webco> they are sending over an application and lease today sometime
1084547825 [11507] <pam/#webco> is refusenik still sick?
1084549202 [11514] <pam/#webco> gracchus: what are you working on?  i have a meeting with academyar
1084549231 [11518] <pam/#webco> y art at 1130 and they are going to ask when we can get those couple of bugs they found fixes and get their production instance updated, what do you think?
1084549499 [11524] <pam/#webco> ok, good deal
1084551453 [11533] <pam/#webco> brian otnes request for our help on the 25th of may for new server set up
1084551467 [11537] <pam/#webco> bad bad bad timing for us, lots of deadlines between now and june 1
1084558861 [11559] <pam/#webco> i don't understand that
1084558928 [11565] <pam/#webco> eek, ok
1084560194 [11569] <pam/#webco> ok
1084566199 [11578] <pam/#webco> hey jesse
1084566209 [11582] <pam/#webco> email from alex came in, is the saic instance going to be up today?
1084566233 [11589] <pam/#webco> woo hoo
1084566240 [11595] <pam/#webco> god bless jesse
1084566279 [11600] <pam/#webco> there are two bugs that need to get fixed for academyart and they requested a third be added if it will not delay an update to them on Tuesday
1084566346 [11610] <pam/#webco> ok, the two that are listed now are 7304 and 7305 and they would like to add 7213, which I will up
1084566353 [11614] <pam/#webco> thanks so much jess
1084566358 [11616] <pam/#webco> eeeeeeeeeeee
1084566366 [11618] <pam/#webco> and we can't have that
1084566426 [11623] <pam/#webco> i haven
1084566432 [11625] <pam/#webco> ot gotten it yet
1084571793 [11668] <pam/#webco> time to go home
1084806488 [11708] <pam/#webco> morning
1084806509 [11710] <pam/#webco> jesse: i have a meeting with academyart at 1130 today, did you get anywhere on those open bugs for them?
1084806649 [11712] <pam/#webco> craigl: you in the office?
1084806672 [11714] <pam/#webco> frank tate on phone, their sysadmin Aaron quit and one of his checkout centers does not have a printer configured
1084806687 [11720] <pam/#webco> can you talk to him about how the new set up goes?
1084806721 [11726] <pam/#webco> what can I ask him to forward in email so that we could help him that way?
1084806771 [11734] <pam/#webco> ok, he is going to send email
1084807918 [11741] <pam/#webco> gracchus: you there?
1084808899 [11760] <pam/#webco> gracchus: academyart does not need 7286 or 7298, can you pls start with the others, we can lock down a release to them and then get the rrt, rapid return ones?  
1084808947 [11765] <pam/#webco> 7286  amd 7298 are for the chapman release, which should happen this week also but I worry about fixing those on the academyart taged release for fear of causing more circulation problems for them
1084810287 [11776] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did you see mail from alex? do you thin you can give her an update?
1084813680 [11788] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1084815002 [11791] <pam/#webco> waaa, pete wants a testing instance, too many deadlines too many deadlines
1084815151 [11795] <pam/#webco> gracchus: after doing the three academyart bugs and getting them a release, when would be your guess for getting the two chapman bugs (7286 and 7298) and getting chapman a testing instance, sorry to keep bugging you, I know you are swamped
1084816344 [11805] <pam/#webco> gracchus?
1084816427 [11814] <pam/#webco> what text tho?
1084816440 [11818] <pam/#webco> i told him to send an email, he is A-nnoying
1084817315 [11824] <pam/#webco> i don't see any mail to or from frank, maybe no support on it?
1084817488 [11828] <pam/#webco> saw that
1084818199 [11834] <pam/#webco> not sure, maybe you should confirm with him before hand
1084818393 [11843] <pam/#webco> ok
1084818410 [11845] <pam/#webco> gracchus around?
1084818728 [11862] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1084819679 [11868] <pam/#webco> ok, i am going to take a lunch break
1084822827 [11907] <pam/#webco> craig: 7304 is valid on academyart testing instance
1084822881 [11909] <pam/#webco> i log in as a window worker, make simple checkout, asks for my pin, I enter my pin and it just refreshes and keeps on asking for my pin
1084822945 [11913] <pam/#webco> yes
1084822956 [11915] <pam/#webco> the system asks you for your pin for any restricted action
1084822966 [11917] <pam/#webco> even if you have the capability to perform that action
1084822987 [11920] <pam/#webco> this is if the bypass pin entry capability is turned off, which it is for most operators
1084823013 [11925] <pam/#webco> i reopened the bug 
1084829551 [11988] <pam/#webco> gracchus: is there an update to saic instance status?
1084830725 [11994] <pam/#webco> ok
1084900323 [12128] <pam/#webco> not for them, yay
1084900344 [12133] <pam/#webco> can i get an updated release instance with their current data for a quick test swing before we update their testing instance?
1084900371 [12139] <pam/#webco> sure
1084900377 [12143] <pam/#webco> coolio
1084900482 [12153] <pam/#webco> there are no resources there, not too easy to test on
1084900516 [12155] <pam/#webco> is it possible to get an update to 8085?
1084900641 [12168] <pam/#webco> no, i meant to test a little to see if there are any glaring problems before we udpate academayrt
1084900671 [12175] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1084900889 [12188] <pam/#webco> no clue, you filed the bug, did you talk to him or he just left msg?
1084900922 [12195] <pam/#webco> i suspect he is talking about containers/contained resources and how they list on the print agreement form
1084900932 [12199] <pam/#webco> but I am not sure 100%
1084900950 [12202] <pam/#webco> there is a spec for the way ACCD needs their stuff to print
1084900968 [12204] <pam/#webco> are you working on that now?
1084900978 [12208] <pam/#webco> cause chapman stuff should really be next in line
1084900994 [12213] <pam/#webco> they need an update tomorrow for testing and there are several open bugs on rrt
1084901006 [12219] <pam/#webco> i can call to clarify what the heck he is talking about, sure
1084901027 [12221] <pam/#webco> and bugs on the bar code box too
1084901596 [12226] <pam/#webco> bug poetry
1084902782 [12248] <pam/#webco> gracchus: I had to reopen 7305, only half of problem is fixed
1084903421 [12255] <pam/#webco> is the delete resource bug fix a part of the build I am on? seems to be working exactly the same
1084903448 [12257] <pam/#webco> as described in the bug
1084903699 [12280] <pam/#webco> ok
1084904495 [12294] <pam/#webco> craigl: when you are ready to pick up a chapman bug the one that really needs to get knocked out first is 7298
1084904528 [12298] <pam/#webco> gracchus: ok, pls advise when boris 8085 is correct build
1084904624 [12309] <pam/#webco> craigl: ok great, bugzilla doesn't list you as the owner of that bug so i didn't know
1084905214 [12323] <pam/#webco> yah, sure thing
1084908633 [12350] <pam/#webco> shoot, where is the chapman borsi instance, topic got changes and I don't remember
1084908779 [12356] <pam/#webco> really?
1084908796 [12358] <pam/#webco> craigl: //boris/ ?
1084908860 [12364] <pam/#webco> great, very nice, but you could have jsut told me there was a new page that linked to all test instances
1084909364 [12368] <pam/#webco> hm, well the system doesn't just refresh when I enter my pin as a window worker but it does allow me to override things I should not be allowed to
1084909510 [12370] <pam/#webco> oh wait, my mistage
1084909512 [12372] <pam/#webco> mistake
1084909657 [12375] <pam/#webco> academyart release version looking good, confirmed all closed bugs
1084909762 [12377] <pam/#webco> we will need to do an update to the academyart testing instance with a fresh load of their current production data for another round of testing by them
1084909774 [12379] <pam/#webco> i will call them to make sure a good time when they will not be testing
1084909985 [12383] <pam/#webco> indeed
1084910619 [12394] <pam/#webco> ok, chapman crits/blockers down to four on bugzilla
1084910685 [12396] <pam/#webco> craigl: what do you think about updating acadmeayrt testing instance at 4pm today?
1084910806 [12411] <pam/#webco> craigl: if we want another testing instance for usc with their data and cinapps I would be happy to start on testing it
1084910817 [12413] <pam/#webco> well, maybe happy isn't the best word
1084910913 [12416] <pam/#webco> hm, chapman testing instance seems hung
1084911613 [12428] <pam/#webco> craigl: great
1084912216 [12434] <pam/#webco> gracchus: if craigl is too busy with usc/academyart stuff maybe you should get bug 7298, it is the major one that needs to be working to show pete, just an idean, if craigl can get it then that is good
1084912498 [12443] <pam/#webco> which is what? you get to work on something for 15 min before I interrupt you?
1084913801 [12450] <pam/#webco> ok, trying now
1084913964 [12453] <pam/#webco> there are no resource types in the applet on chapman testing instance
1084914032 [12456] <pam/#webco> i need them to test this
1084914252 [12467] <pam/#webco> now what? are the rtypes missing now? yes. do I need them to test for 7298 now? yes. can you fix them now? you tell me
1084916156 [12478] <pam/#webco> in a red bar at the top? 
1084916172 [12480] <pam/#webco> of the page
1084916269 [12482] <pam/#webco> weird, it appears that two resources at chapman have the same barcode 000868
1084916295 [12486] <pam/#webco> so the pickup was a success?
1084916309 [12488] <pam/#webco> what url can i use to see your instance and what was the ck number again?
1084916377 [12492] <pam/#webco> i get java.net exception error
1084916457 [12496] <pam/#webco> any idea why i would get java error instead of getting into your instance?
1084916578 [12501] <pam/#webco> java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
1084916645 [12506] <pam/#webco> criagl: what is your plan of attach then with all these mounting support issues? academyart update does need to get done today, where does the usc work fit in and if I can test on your instance I can work on recreating 7298
1084916720 [12512] <pam/#webco> yes please
1084916729 [12514] <pam/#webco> update to test instance and fresh load of current data
1084916812 [12519] <pam/#webco> yes, the test instance with latest release build
1084916849 [12523] <pam/#webco> the one on their server
1084916852 [12525] <pam/#webco> not on ours
1084918613 [12718] <pam/#webco> criagl: your instance on hm hung up during my trying to test the bar code bug 
1084918740 [12737] <pam/#webco> bows
1084918954 [12769] <pam/#webco> ok, but all I did was the same thing I originally did but i will add some details to the buggie
1084919023 [12783] <pam/#webco> can you stop the spin on your instance so I can gather some additional info?
1084919141 [12818] <pam/#webco> ok
1084919263 [12843] <pam/#webco> i got it the long way, updated bug
1084919443 [12884] <pam/#webco> fabulous, thanks
1084919679 [12918] <pam/#webco> that is ok
1084919684 [12922] <pam/#webco> since i got the bug on your instance
1084978766 [13073] <pam/#webco> morning
1084979313 [13091] <pam/#webco> ok
1084979356 [13094] <pam/#webco> sorry, what is usc urls again?
1084979564 [13099] <pam/#webco> craig: i do a search for a group in PEC and get an immediate error
1084979719 [13103] <pam/#webco> filing bug and finding more info for you
1084979753 [13109] <pam/#webco> ok, got error from Find Groups when I changed org to PEC and search field to Groups
1084979776 [13111] <pam/#webco> when I did a find for org ANY and search ANY I only got 4 results, that would lead me to believe the integration did not run?
1084979835 [13116] <pam/#webco> wait, maybe i am confusing academyart with usc
1084979851 [13120] <pam/#webco> integration is supposed to create groups or just patron ids with group names?
1084980680 [13131] <pam/#webco> can I please get an updated build with the chapman fixes to our testing instance for them?
1084980805 [13146] <pam/#webco> sure, when ever you get a chance is fine
1084980812 [13148] <pam/#webco> ok, will check again
1084980995 [13150] <pam/#webco> craigl: i get this error when I hit the find button on the groups page, searching for org ANY and search field ANY Servlet thread failing with: There's junk in this string: ".17".<br> 
1084981008 [13156] <pam/#webco> ok
1084981295 [13166] <pam/#webco> what happens if you search for any?
1084981420 [13178] <pam/#webco> well since the default setting for that page is to have org set to ANY you should let them know that they need to change that field when doing a search, there is an open bug for the org set to ANY on default 
1084981451 [13181] <pam/#webco> otherwise they will be calling us when the search result comes back with 10
1084981569 [13193] <pam/#webco> how does the cinapps decide what org these groups belong to?
1084981830 [13199] <pam/#webco> coolio, just advise usc of that i guess
1084985129 [13221] <pam/#webco> aren't you happy I didn't just give that to you :)
1084985148 [13224] <pam/#webco> who loves ya?
1084989395 [13238] <pam/#webco> criagl: how goes things with usc? any time for a chapman test instance update?
1084989702 [13246] <pam/#webco> ok, cause we need to get a testing instance up on chapman for pete to take a look at but first I would take another look with the latest fixes on our chapman testing instance
1084989721 [13250] <pam/#webco> thanks
1084989858 [13261] <pam/#webco> the release branch is the one I want then
1084991153 [13281] <pam/#webco> craigl: there still are no resource types in the applet of chapman testing instance
1084995290 [13312] <pam/#webco> chapman looking good
1084995300 [13314] <pam/#webco> bar code seems to be working really well
1084995305 [13316] <pam/#webco> rrt working as far as I can tell
1084995311 [13318] <pam/#webco> pete will test on boris in about an hour
1084997003 [13326] <pam/#webco> evergreen has run into a problem they can not with a resource throwing an error when ever they try to do anything to circulate it
1084997044 [13330] <pam/#webco> since things seem to be getting pretty stable with these new update we are going to give to chapman and academyart, what does everyone think about getting evergreen a test instance and then an update next week?
1085001207 [13349] <pam/#webco> craigl: no worries on evergreen error, it magically disappeared when I went to confirm it
1085001221 [13351] <pam/#webco> but we will try to get an update to them if chapman takes it and is stable with it
1085001245 [13353] <pam/#webco> craigl: we also need to do an instance split for artcenter, spliting the tool crib off to its own instance, like usc
1085001251 [13355] <pam/#webco> how long do you think that process would take?
1085001461 [13362] <pam/#webco> yeah, def. update first i think, thanks
1085004079 [13370] <pam/#webco> ok, i have to run today
1085071386 [13446] <pam/#webco> is the debugger on the boris chapman instance? i am going to try to recreate the error pete got yesterday
1085071760 [13466] <pam/#webco> craigl: thx
1085072631 [13481] <pam/#webco> craigl: can you tell me if a fax comes in down there soon?
1085072797 [13489] <pam/#webco> not really, just expecting one from accd and they are having trouble sending to this fax machine for some reason
1085072866 [13493] <pam/#webco> no, i gave them the old number to default to
1085072871 [13495] <pam/#webco> thx tho
1085074359 [13516] <pam/#webco> yay, i am actually on phone with artcenter so have not had much chance
1085077338 [13541] <pam/#webco> great!
1085077345 [13543] <pam/#webco> i will call pete and ask him to try again
1085077361 [13549] <pam/#webco> ok then
1085077438 [13553] <pam/#webco> ok
1085077504 [13557] <pam/#webco> criagl: email from rik is in regards to they set up a new campus, new webco org and two new webco checkout centers
1085077523 [13561] <pam/#webco> i know we have some special thing set up with their printing because we have their server which is why I asked him to email in
1085077599 [13568] <pam/#webco> got a hold of pete, he is going to try again
1085166694 [13698] <pam/#webco> craigl: did you ever look at artcenter support email sent to you yesterday from rik delise?
1085166845 [13702] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1085175158 [13726] <pam/#webco> is the debugger still on the chapman testing instance on boris?
1085175163 [13728] <pam/#webco> seems to be moving slow
1085175233 [13742] <pam/#webco> ok, no big deal for me
1085175385 [13752] <pam/#webco> no hanging yet, just a little pokey

1085762174 [199] <pam/#webco> craigl: academyart is getting a bad gateway error, is that just a restart situation?
1085762361 [206] <pam/#webco> webcheckout.academyart.edu

1086111262 [423] <pam/#webco> the list of msu problems grows
1086111300 [425] <pam/#webco> if there was a migration problem with descriptions where they are no longer in their instance, we can retrieve that right? they don't need to start re-entering?
1086111359 [429] <pam/#webco> resources and/or resource types
1086111377 [433] <pam/#webco> i am getting clairification from frank on that, sounds like migration problems

1086116463 [585] <pam/#webco> i only know how to ssh into prep through the shell

1086116711 [608] <pam/#webco> cool

1086116751 [623] <pam/#webco> ok, ill give it a try

1086117095 [641] <pam/#webco> yep, that worked, cool
1086117584 [645] <pam/#webco> ??
1086118746 [656] <pam/#webco> craigl: messy messy
1086118757 [658] <pam/#webco> not sure what you were expecting it to look like
1086119594 [666] <pam/#webco> criagl: i opened 7366 for other migration problem for resource descriptions too for msu
1086119622 [675] <pam/#webco> also, got email from utexas, they are having trouble with patron load for tomorrow start of thier new term, everyone coming in inactive, oy oy oy 
1086119770 [677] <pam/#webco> maybe i can push them off until first thing tomorrow morning
1086120473 [685] <pam/#webco> well its really just a way to schedule things because we are already holding up msu so who gets our attention now? unless you can fix the three msu bugs and troubleshoot utexas at the same time 
1086120651 [689] <pam/#webco> you rock
1086120661 [693] <pam/#webco> i am almost done with the allocation list
1086121216 [699] <pam/#webco> was that fixed directly to their instance or will we need to restart or something?
1086121222 [701] <pam/#webco> I have the list of allocation fixes done
1086121243 [707] <pam/#webco> most are the unserialized resource but there are some that are serialized resources so their still may be some conflicts
1086121389 [710] <pam/#webco> craigl: MSU_CK_correction placed back in my drop box, can you pick up from there and see if file is ok?
1086121554 [719] <pam/#webco> i tried but I don't have permission to do that
1086121663 [723] <pam/#webco> im sorry craigl, i don't see tmp file
1086121777 [725] <pam/#webco> criagl: can you pull it from the Shared folder on Skeletor?

1086122424 [740] <pam/#webco> fax from sarah sent to support again
1086122816 [743] <pam/#webco> craigl: was that utexas calling?
1086123069 [751] <pam/#webco> hahahahaha

1086123124 [761] <pam/#webco> ok
1086123394 [769] <pam/#webco> lucky me I answered his call this time, he is telling me step by step everything you guys did, o joy
1086123415 [773] <pam/#webco> i think ill just hang up, bet he wont' notice for at least 5 min
1086127710 [788] <pam/#webco> craigl: did you get anywhere with msu allocations?
1086128261 [798] <pam/#webco> ok, that is cool, just keep me updated on the allocation fix and I will email frank with an update
1086188671 [843] <pam/#webco> yo yo
1086189461 [846] <pam/#webco> criagl: what is the story with msu?
1086189681 [851] <pam/#webco> ok, there is more to the resource description problem, they don't appear in the applet, Im going to talk to eric about fixing it quickly or not
1086190001 [857] <pam/#webco> i don't know but they should
1086190144 [860] <pam/#webco> there are two items more for msu when the allocation fix is complete
1086190786 [864] <pam/#webco> craigl: so after allocation fix pls pick up 7370 and 7369
1086190917 [870] <pam/#webco> saic is down, craigl can you get it? I know saic is special and jesse showed me how but I am not confident to do it quick enought for them
1086191207 [883] <pam/#webco> not on the phone with them any more and it was a mook who called in so I dont' know how to get him back
1086191222 [888] <pam/#webco> ok
1086191280 [893] <pam/#webco> i can try but he said he was calling because sarah was not around
1086191302 [897] <pam/#webco> what do you want me to confirm with her?
1086191359 [911] <pam/#webco> they are already not getting a response, that is why they called, pls just do the restart and ill take the call/heat if there is a problem
1086191522 [919] <pam/#webco> great, thanks
1086191538 [923] <pam/#webco> any one know what is up with saic form? sarah sent in email at 907 this morning
1086191868 [929] <pam/#webco> gracchus: is she expecting them today? are they enhancements in your opin or needed, should we try to put it off?
1086194775 [949] <pam/#webco> criagl: http://webcheckout.academyart.edu/test/wco has bad gateway error, after you run the msu allocation thing can you get it back up? pls no need to interrupt msu work, they can wait for us to get this back up
1086194938 [953] <pam/#webco> i thought the bad gateway was a db problem?
1086194969 [957] <pam/#webco> no, that too
1086195846 [966] <pam/#webco> sure thing
1086196844 [975] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1086196861 [977] <pam/#webco> allocations look good, checked several and they were fixed, and 12 failures is not bad!
1086196872 [979] <pam/#webco> on to the next....:)
1086196911 [981] <pam/#webco> craigl: i checked a different version of 3.1, academyart boris instance, and resource descriptions in the applet don't work there either
1086197750 [984] <pam/#webco> when I try to connect to ucla I get the following error
1086197750 [986] <pam/#webco> Proxy Error
1086197750 [988] <pam/#webco> The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
1086197750 [990] <pam/#webco> The proxy server could not handle the request GET/ucla/wco.
1086197751 [992] <pam/#webco> Reason: Could not connect to remote machine: Connection refused
1086197763 [994] <pam/#webco> are they down?
1086197802 [996] <pam/#webco> or is there a problem with my connection?
1086198325 [1001] <pam/#webco> email just came in from angie at ucal, they are down
1086198342 [1005] <pam/#webco> craigl: can you get it?
1086198345 [1007] <pam/#webco> craigl not around?
1086198646 [1019] <pam/#webco> yes, they had power issues last week and craig was working with angie (their sysadmin) to get it back up but I think he was mostly sending her commands to run herself instead of trying to bring it back up himself
1086198697 [1021] <pam/#webco> they have been down for quite some time and I would like them to just be back up before they kill us
1086199209 [1029] <pam/#webco> she claimed the power went out, not an intentional reboot but who knows
1086199229 [1032] <pam/#webco> not sure what to say, no one to work on it currently, what do you think?
1086199508 [1034] <pam/#webco> ucla has a blocker, boo hoo
1086199529 [1038] <pam/#webco> craigl: when you are done with msu bugs I gots some more work for you.....:
1086199637 [1042] <pam/#webco> oo, sweet
1086199771 [1044] <pam/#webco> ok, three assigned, msu first then ucla then the moon
1086201355 [1056] <pam/#webco> not me
1086202300 [1066] <pam/#webco> i would say yes, eric?
1086202324 [1070] <pam/#webco> send me the specs on what you want and I can ask eric
1086202327 [1074] <pam/#webco> o, ok
1086203530 [1078] <pam/#webco> criagl: pls let me know if a fax comes in down there
1086205802 [1098] <pam/#webco> criagl: there is a werid box on some resoruces in the applet, the ones that don't have descriptions can you make that go away?
1086205853 [1102] <pam/#webco> craigl: dan is talking to me about utexas, he says you were going to schedule a time with their sysadmin folk to assist in an OS upgrade and it was supposed to be this week?  do you know antyhing about this and if so what do we need to do and what is the status?
1086207223 [1116] <pam/#webco> hm, werid control-b thing,why would they go in and hit contol-b on every resource that doesn't have a description, my guess is that they don't belong there
1086207773 [1121] <pam/#webco> yes, delete the control-b
1086207927 [1125] <pam/#webco> first i want you to have a cup of coffee, then cough twice, add in a little stretch and then install the servelt on msu
1086208263 [1127] <pam/#webco> craigl: can you email angie with the restart voodoo perfromed on ucla so she can reboot the server and screw it up again and then call us to fix it?
1086208775 [1148] <pam/#webco> craigl: thanks
1086208784 [1150] <pam/#webco> msg chevalier the beard?
1086208831 [1154] <pam/#webco> gracchus: my opinon of that pir bug is that it would be an enhancement, not nec at this time, but maybe eric thinks differntly
1086208983 [1162] <pam/#webco> criagl: not sure if you want to attempt the other msu bug, also about the applet, fix that and then update the servlet for msu?
1086209005 [1166] <pam/#webco> i'll ask eric to respond and get you the email he sent
1086209042 [1170] <pam/#webco> eric: maybe you should review, or me maybe, the pir bugs
1086209065 [1174] <pam/#webco> cool
1086210490 [1212] <pam/#webco> o so nice

1086211958 [1239] <pam/#webco> yes
1086212455 [1248] <pam/#webco> craigl: can you respond to my questions?
1086212945 [1271] <pam/#webco> ok, I am opening a bug for the print tickets and print invoices not working in 3.1.1 but I am a little unsure exactly what the deal is, I believe they need to be reworked because the way printing happens was changed but I could be way off
1086213055 [1280] <pam/#webco> i need them to work, I don't know what state they are in now
1086213072 [1286] <pam/#webco> that is what I am trying to say to you
1086213152 [1293] <pam/#webco> other than being told they need to be reworked because of the changes to the print aggreement forms I really don't know anything
1086213215 [1298] <pam/#webco> craigl: so on your assigned bugs, start with p1/blocker and them move to p1/crits then to p1/major etc
1086213884 [1333] <pam/#webco> finally

1086630288 [1941] <pam/#webco> i restarted artcenter instead of academyart, oops
1086630315 [1943] <pam/#webco> they seem to be up now and were up when that email just came in
1086634112 [1987] <pam/#webco> nice nice
1086634129 [1991] <pam/#webco> i can take somes peeks if you give the url
1086634204 [1997] <pam/#webco> criagl: off the subject of artcenter, we need to have the academyart psoft integration back up by next monday at the latest, what is your op about feasibility of that? should you do that instead of printed forms or can you get pforms first and then psoft?
1086634263 [1999] <pam/#webco> i get HTTP ERROR: 403 Forbidden
1086634264 [2001] <pam/#webco> RequestURI=/ 
1086634267 [2005] <pam/#webco> at that url
1086634285 [2007] <pam/#webco> that would pwonderful
1086634293 [2009] <pam/#webco> be pwonderful i mean
1086634604 [2016] <pam/#webco> ah yes
1086634633 [2018] <pam/#webco> wait, what machine did you put that on cause it should have been on their server
1086634659 [2021] <pam/#webco> which they should be able to access without dealing with firewall issues?
1086634794 [2027] <pam/#webco> tricky stuff?
1086634823 [2031] <pam/#webco> could the firewall still block it if it is on their machine is my question, as unclear as it was
1086634968 [2038] <pam/#webco> ok
1086635022 [2040] <pam/#webco> craigl: no rtypes in the applet for artcenter test
1086635029 [2042] <pam/#webco> o no, there they go
1086635032 [2045] <pam/#webco> this is slow
1086635436 [2077] <pam/#webco> ok
1086635570 [2079] <pam/#webco> well comparing the test instance to the production it looks like both are equally slow so at least it's not worse :)
1086640468 [2110] <pam/#webco> boris still down?
1086642519 [2128] <pam/#webco> yes

1086793618 [4487] <pam/#webco> was there only one page to that fax?
1086794056 [4493] <pam/#webco> craigl: did you see my comments on artcenter but 7389 before you signed off irc?

1086797425 [4574] <pam/#webco> Apache/2.0.40 (Red Hat Linux) 
1086797570 [4585] <pam/#webco> 8089 works for me
1086798315 [4597] <pam/#webco> ??
1086798371 [4601] <pam/#webco> yes, just didn't understand what you meant, but I do now
1086798390 [4603] <pam/#webco> i can't see ck-577 through the interface but I can get to 879
1086798406 [4607] <pam/#webco> i assume it is because 577 got confirmed as an unsaved allocation or something?
1086798465 [4613] <pam/#webco> what
1086798645 [4621] <pam/#webco> ah, i see
1086798686 [4628] <pam/#webco> what do you think about running a query that may catch any others like 577? how long, feasible, etc?
1086798763 [4633] <pam/#webco> oh, i thought maybe it was a case you didn't query for, sorry I misunderstood
1086798906 [4637] <pam/#webco> yikes
1086798930 [4639] <pam/#webco> can we restore 577?
1086798981 [4643] <pam/#webco> would you pls?
1086799042 [4649] <pam/#webco> yes
1086799299 [4653] <pam/#webco> not my call to make
1086799866 [4662] <pam/#webco> ok, asking for agreement form from frank
1086800047 [4670] <pam/#webco> where are we now then?
1086802053 [4684] <pam/#webco> sure
1086802570 [4688] <pam/#webco> i printed them up here, didn't think about changing printers in time, do you want to come get them/'
1086803272 [4692] <pam/#webco> craigl: did a fax ever come in?
1086803675 [4704] <pam/#webco> yeah, it is somewhere around here, ill dig it up
1086808263 [4710] <pam/#webco> craigl: got ithaca? should I restart it?
1086808335 [4714] <pam/#webco> k
1086818362 [4741] <pam/#webco> ??
1086818412 [4745] <pam/#webco> it should do half the job if the client doesn't have the help desk module and the whole job if they do
1086818456 [4749] <pam/#webco> there was an option after taking offline that said create ticket so you could go on to the next step if you wanted, that is gone now?
1086818559 [4757] <pam/#webco> ok, good, I think we have all the bugs we need
1086818567 [4765] <pam/#webco> hehe
1086818600 [4767] <pam/#webco> you can also create a ticket from the resource detail tickets tab and not go through the offline hoop
1086818733 [4777] <pam/#webco> hm, i think once you are in your vmbox you hit the star key and it should prompt you for your pin
1086818756 [4779] <pam/#webco> i think
1086819207 [4793] <pam/#webco> me too
1086967244 [4881] <pam/#webco> sigh
1086967397 [4885] <pam/#webco> what?
1086967468 [4891] <pam/#webco> at least you got me to smile!
1086967486 [4893] <pam/#webco> now can you magically make all our demanding clients go away?
1086967505 [4895] <pam/#webco> "i want webcheckout to work, I want there to be no bugs" wah wah wah, babies
1086967557 [4899] <pam/#webco> perfect!
1086967681 [4903] <pam/#webco> they must go through dan for that
1086967703 [4905] <pam/#webco> gracchus: is there an PIR testing instance?
1086967732 [4907] <pam/#webco> craigl: are you on the phone?
1086968128 [4913] <pam/#webco> any eta? i have a meeting with them at 1130 so they will surely ask
1086968266 [4921] <pam/#webco> criagl: no answer there so go ahead and take em down, they are not open
1086968297 [4925] <pam/#webco> gracchus: that would be good, I don't think I have the url for the PIR testing anymore so if you can give that too pls
1086968485 [4930] <pam/#webco> you rock
1086968490 [4932] <pam/#webco> oy, msu, oy oy oy
1086968573 [4934] <pam/#webco> craigl: do you think it would be useless to try and run that query you wrote for msu missing items onallocations again to see if any more come up? Frank is reporting more missing cks from the system
1086968589 [4938] <pam/#webco> i just don't know what to say to him
1086968828 [4951] <pam/#webco> gracchus: thanks
1086968871 [4955] <pam/#webco> criagl: i wonder if I should do the audit for msu and provide a list of ck's that need to be restored, sigh, i don't know, maybe that is too much
1086968961 [4960] <pam/#webco> ok
1086970724 [4989] <pam/#webco> its wrong how much i love coffee
1086972253 [4994] <pam/#webco> gracchus: just to confirm, the testing instance of PIR is associated with the boris testing academyart webcheckout instance, NOT the webcheckout testing instance on the academyart server
1086972395 [4998] <pam/#webco> hm, i am confused now
1086972471 [5001] <pam/#webco> when I type in http://webcheckout.academyart.edu/test/wco i go to a different instance than if I use the link from the boris// page but it also resolves to http://webcheckout.academyart.edu/test/wco
1086972490 [5003] <pam/#webco> how can it be?
1086972553 [5005] <pam/#webco> oy, maybe its me
1086972811 [5008] <pam/#webco> gracchs: there is no confirm reservation button on the interface of PIR now
1086972839 [5012] <pam/#webco> oh wait, shit i am confused
1086972954 [5016] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i don't think i can give these urls, i don't think this is user testable yet, i can file bugs but they aren't going to be able to do anything really and it will just freak them out I think
1086973066 [5019] <pam/#webco> there seems to be one major blocker I think
1086973081 [5021] <pam/#webco> i get the error - Resource GR-2007(card) circulates from checkout center issue room.
1086973102 [5023] <pam/#webco> no matter which checkout center I ask for resources from
1086973289 [5027] <pam/#webco> yah, I can't create a new user in the boris instnace of webco and have it work on the PIR instance
1086973317 [5029] <pam/#webco> academyart boris i mean
1086973419 [5033] <pam/#webco> tell the ??
1086973428 [5035] <pam/#webco> o you mean tell aau to hold on?
1086973465 [5043] <pam/#webco> ok, I can hold them off a while, can you give me any kind of time est? 
1086973631 [5052] <pam/#webco> i do understand
1086973773 [5060] <pam/#webco> ok, I will try to work out advising the client of the deadline slip
1086973927 [5064] <pam/#webco> criagl: call from joel at usc, saying they are down, i am getting connection refused if I try to tunnel to them, what does that mean? 
1086974238 [5068] <pam/#webco> pls disregard my vague msg to academyart, I am letting them down with baby steps
1086976691 [5082] <pam/#webco> ok, ill come down
1086977422 [5088] <pam/#webco> ok
1086977944 [5096] <pam/#webco> craigl: yep, those files are what I need
1086979148 [5116] <pam/#webco> craigl: got usc or want me to try?
1086979262 [5120] <pam/#webco> do I need to start pec and the other sep?
1086979273 [5122] <pam/#webco> other instance i mean
1086979371 [5130] <pam/#webco> ok, i got server not running, jetty not running
1086979374 [5132] <pam/#webco> at PEC
1086979418 [5136] <pam/#webco> i tried wcoctrl start and got a lot of gook back but the last line said Jetty HTTP server failed to start.
1086979433 [5140] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1086981772 [5155] <pam/#webco> criagl: when you get back, i have the remaining allocations for msu for correction
1086981857 [5159] <pam/#webco> craigl: correction file is in OSX/users/shared directory on my machine, could not write to your public folder
1086982386 [5173] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1086983305 [5182] <pam/#webco> ok
1086983644 [5185] <pam/#webco> oy, craigl, you saw saic email i assume?
1086983731 [5191] <pam/#webco> sure
1086985598 [5217] <pam/#webco> sends next let down email to academyart and begins to avoid her phone
1086985686 [5219] <pam/#webco> craigl: can you run the msu fix list?
1086985857 [5231] <pam/#webco> i put this in the buffer already
1086985872 [5235] <pam/#webco> i can't copy to your public drive, file is in users/shared
1086985952 [5245] <pam/#webco> it says i don't have permission
1086985964 [5249] <pam/#webco> this is the same place i put the last msu correction file, i know you can get it
1086986301 [5265] <pam/#webco> ok
1086986530 [5275] <pam/#webco> hehe
1086986545 [5280] <pam/#webco> wishes she was on vacation for two weeks
1086986590 [5282] <pam/#webco> because i enjoy others pain to the point of laughter
1086986826 [5290] <pam/#webco> o thank god, it all makes perfect sense now
1086986876 [5298] <pam/#webco> you'd be amazed at the amount of pain i can take now
1086987147 [5321] <pam/#webco> ssshhh, you might wake me
1086987257 [5329] <pam/#webco> what ever it is it would be worth it
1086987302 [5331] <pam/#webco> criagl: we don't store start and end times?
1086987397 [5336] <pam/#webco> its not the only thing missing
1086987444 [5342] <pam/#webco> ah
1086987464 [5350] <pam/#webco> can't hear her phone ringing for fear it is academyart
1086987576 [5361] <pam/#webco> HA! that is almost worth having you work on it!
1086987586 [5363] <pam/#webco> i don't think we should divert you though
1086987615 [5365] <pam/#webco> criagl: maybe we can put it off until first thing monday morning and get eric's opinion on just handing the list over to frank to re-enter orders
1086987780 [5372] <pam/#webco> actually he can but he may not want to, some of the ones in the past may have been re-entered under different cks
1086987805 [5374] <pam/#webco> no, i agree that at this point it does not make sense for you to spend more time on this
1086987841 [5378] <pam/#webco> beats the f$%^#^%$# out of me
1086987910 [5388] <pam/#webco> sorry man, as far as I know saic is the only client that uses that feature and I have never seen a printed building pass
1086987939 [5393] <pam/#webco> gracchus makes me giggle when he's drinking gin n tonics
1086989870 [5412] <pam/#webco> here comes violeta and she is armed and dangerous
1087226677 [267] <pam/#webco> not showing up where? sorry, my mail is still down
1087226751 [275] <pam/#webco> yes, he is up here with me
1087227590 [280] <pam/#webco> gracchus: craigl is restarting saic because it ran out of memory
1087228498 [283] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did you fix something for lansing so that their resources show up or do we need more info from them?
1087228704 [292] <pam/#webco> ok, will ask
1087229424 [295] <pam/#webco> geez, you would think covad had never moved anyones service before
1087229516 [305] <pam/#webco> ok, our site is down too, onshored.com
1087229520 [307] <pam/#webco> not sure if you new that
1087230445 [320] <pam/#webco> not all the resources and resource types are appearing in the applet in lansing, I have checked some he gave as examples and the resources are in the find resource result set and they are avail and circulating
1087230463 [322] <pam/#webco> not sure why not showing up in applet
1087230467 [324] <pam/#webco> any ideas?
1087230479 [328] <pam/#webco> he is off his one not sure is he has another, he is on the phone
1087230530 [337] <pam/#webco> os x sucks at that
1087230754 [363] <pam/#webco> criagl: i have java 1.3.1 and 1.4.1, is that a problem?
1087230856 [371] <pam/#webco> ok, i don't know what to do from here
1087231849 [392] <pam/#webco> criagl: i did all that but when i restart the java console does not show up
1087231866 [395] <pam/#webco> if i hit veiw java msgs the box is empty
1087231949 [401] <pam/#webco> IE, i am trying safari now

1087237780 [556] <pam/#webco> criagl: i realize there is a lot of internal things wacked out but I really believe that if lansing is not operational because they can't make reservations through the applet they should get first crack

1087244483 [719] <pam/#webco> actually they were saturady
1087244513 [721] <pam/#webco> walled webcheckout strangness
1087244516 [723] <pam/#webco> called
1087244883 [729] <pam/#webco> k, sorry, ill go back to the pipe now
1087251514 [762] <pam/#webco> going home
1087403013 [1171] <pam/#webco> criagl: will that command get me the admin password for a site?  that still would be useful to me
1087406706 [1192] <pam/#webco> criagl: saic is down, can you restart pls
1087406715 [1196] <pam/#webco> thanks
1087407063 [1206] <pam/#webco> criagl: when I try to log in the system does seem to be spinning, just hangs the browser
1087407289 [1210] <pam/#webco> gracchus: do you need bugs openedfor these issues coming on PIR? 
1087407803 [1214] <pam/#webco> ok, i work in some filing
1087407822 [1216] <pam/#webco> criagl: hows it going on psoft front?
1087407847 [1220] <pam/#webco> woo hoo!
1087408358 [1228] <pam/#webco> sure
1087408410 [1232] <pam/#webco> ok
1087408786 [1237] <pam/#webco> where is the peoplesoft tab where they can tell it what term data to bring in? right now it looks like it brings in all the terms that exist in the psoft, criagB had designed a way, a tab on the org level, where they would pick the term they are in
1087409967 [1244] <pam/#webco> ok
1087410032 [1247] <pam/#webco> it looks ok, altho it is hard for me to tell if it is correctly gathering all folks in the class in all sections and droping them into one webco group 
1087410854 [1251] <pam/#webco> tightens her blindfold
1087410980 [1259] <pam/#webco> falls off her chair in uncontrolable laughter
1087411504 [1269] <pam/#webco> criagl: after psoft for academyart is complete we need to schedule an update for evergreen to the latest build, do youthink it is safe for me to tell them tomorrow afternoon for that?
1087411553 [1273] <pam/#webco> no, i thought we were going to try to get away from staging for everyone before updating but maybe I am wrong
1087411881 [1299] <pam/#webco> there are several bugs filed by evergreen and they have not had an update in a very long time, sometime around end of jan even I think
1087418987 [1386] <pam/#webco> craigB had it on the organization detail page, added a tab called Peoplesoft
1087419588 [1388] <pam/#webco> eric: o my, I thought you were kidding
1087572057 [1579] <pam/#webco> i must restart
1087572581 [1584] <pam/#webco> criagl: i tried several contacts at usc and the phones just ring and ring, i got jason m voicemail so I left him one but he was the one who knew anyway
1087572605 [1588] <pam/#webco> i wonder is something bad happened on their network last night with more than just webco server
1087574938 [1594] <pam/#webco> craigl: usc still down? i am going to try joel and micheal again
1087574944 [1596] <pam/#webco> calling i mean
1087574948 [1599] <pam/#webco> if they are still down
1087575165 [1603] <pam/#webco> ok, informed joel and michael
1087577109 [1614] <pam/#webco> craigl: i was in meeting, i can go check usc now
1087577233 [1619] <pam/#webco> as far as i can tell PEC is up and working
1087577294 [1623] <pam/#webco> yes, i need to do one thing and then i will come down
1087578372 [1625] <pam/#webco> actually ill call unless i need to see something
1087581925 [1631] <pam/#webco> i get a connection failure, timeout
1087582136 [1638] <pam/#webco> ah, yes, that appears to be it
1087582184 [1642] <pam/#webco> groovy
1087582198 [1644] <pam/#webco> want to update the academyart test instance and we can review it there?
1087582301 [1649] <pam/#webco> how long is that?
1087582854 [1657] <pam/#webco> no, its ok, just let me know when
1087586475 [1668] <pam/#webco> andrei called, no biggie
1087589094 [1674] <pam/#webco> craigl: how is that build for psoft going?
1087589637 [1678] <pam/#webco> k
1087591548 [1686] <pam/#webco> not a good sign
1087594347 [1697] <pam/#webco> criagl: so things are not looking good for academyart psoft for today then?
1087596196 [1705] <pam/#webco> ok, will it be up today or should I set my sights on monday morning?
1087596226 [1715] <pam/#webco> ok, but we may need to move fast on monday with andrei comes in, it is his only day to set up the rtypes to the classes
1087596269 [1723] <pam/#webco> no, he is going to have to approve the test instance and we are going to have to move to the production instance
1087596287 [1726] <pam/#webco> that is what I have been saying all along, they need this back, they have students and the new term has started
1087596391 [1730] <pam/#webco> thanks
1087830881 [1758] <pam/#webco> morning
1087830888 [1760] <pam/#webco> craigl: you around?
1087831025 [1765] <pam/#webco> how is the academyart psoft?
1087831182 [1773] <pam/#webco> we can definitely move forward with that, I can ask them which terms they need, I assume summer 04 but I will confirm
1087831229 [1777] <pam/#webco> one question, do we need to move them to a later build on production in order to get them the psoft, they are on build 4, testing instance is build 16
1087831314 [1781] <pam/#webco> which build?
1087831442 [1785] <pam/#webco> ok
1087833259 [1789] <pam/#webco> just in time for me to send the email to them damn, just one minute ago!
1087833326 [1797] <pam/#webco> hehe
1087833407 [1801] <pam/#webco> pls advise when the new test build is up
1087834745 [1811] <pam/#webco> craigl: ok, testing now
1087835210 [1814] <pam/#webco> craigl: how can I tell when it is done running?
1087835481 [1820] <pam/#webco> criagl: i don't think this is working as it should, it does not appear to be creating ONE webcheckout class for every section of a psoft class
1087835555 [1826] <pam/#webco> there was a contiuation of the spec that was suppo9sed to bring all the classes into one webcheckout group, I ahve been saying this all along
1087835556 [1828] <pam/#webco> ]
1087835874 [1834] <pam/#webco> criagl: i have a meeting with academyart right now, i will come down after
1087837326 [1840] <pam/#webco> craigl: do you want to come up here, i have the psoft stuff on my screen already and can show you what is needed
1087841268 [1854] <pam/#webco> great, thanks
1087841332 [1859] <pam/#webco> right
1087842888 [1870] <pam/#webco> gracchus: what are the pir testing urls, the one on boris doesn't seem to work for me anymore
1087844013 [1877] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i tried to confirm a PIR reservation and got Unable to confirm: invalid response from WCO server. Is that expected at this point?
1087844353 [1886] <pam/#webco> a little, there was something where the psoft data didn't have a 0 at the beginning but the id cards scan with a 0 so they needed a 0 added, it was something craig did on the fly that was lost some where along the way
1087844842 [1891] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did you see my comment about error from PIR that i am getting?
1087845166 [1895] <pam/#webco> ok
1087851060 [1940] <pam/#webco> craigl: what was up with andrei? need a call now?
1087851394 [1947] <pam/#webco> shoot, is gracchus leaving?
1087851931 [1956] <pam/#webco> criagl: was andrei calling about the psoft integration?
1087852248 [1977] <pam/#webco> cool, did he want it moved to production instance yet?
1087852252 [1983] <pam/#webco> or still testing?
1087854119 [1995] <pam/#webco> small bug in psoft integration, i will file but they can work around it
1087854318 [1999] <pam/#webco> hm, would that be support action?  i am going to assign to craig any way
1087924198 [2101] <pam/#webco> craigl: now can you see me?

1087925762 [2115] <pam/#webco> craigl: you mean upgrade academyart testing instance or production?  did they ok to move to upgrade production?
1087925777 [2121] <pam/#webco> craigl: what needs to be done to get usc upgraded?
1087925787 [2123] <pam/#webco> craigl: there were two questions there

1088099826 [2672] <pam/#webco> ok, just lining stuff up for when they are done since i am out for next couple of days
1088100019 [2681] <pam/#webco> you are removing the authorizations of those patrons to the resource type that the open group relates to
1088100535 [2692] <pam/#webco> craigl: new type authorizations look like bogus stuff, a resource type that was created but never used, never given a name but was created as requiring authorization, I don't believe removing them will cause any problems as long as there are no resources associated to them
1088100878 [2707] <pam/#webco> craigl: no, sorry, must have something to do with cinapps, i don't know a lot about their customization
1088101406 [2712] <pam/#webco> craigl: i am about to leave, this is for later after usc thing gets resolved, artcenter bugs have been assigned to you, if you have gotten print tickets working they could use an update to their testing instance so they can test that
1088101956 [2730] <pam/#webco> ok, going now, be back on tuesday with a tan!
1088101985 [2734] <pam/#webco> thanks
1088521576 [2981] <pam/#webco> hey hey, who missed me??
1088521895 [2989] <pam/#webco> just a heads up that I am headed into a meeting at 1030 which could last around an hour
1088524655 [3022] <pam/#webco> craigl: having  a resource import meeting, what is asset-tag
1088526969 [3044] <pam/#webco> craigl: what is destination in the spread sheet now?
1088527360 [3051] <pam/#webco> ok, we can go over it when my meeting is done
1088531298 [3065] <pam/#webco> is boris 9008 really up to date for some testing by me?
1088532151 [3072] <pam/#webco> thanks
1088534191 [3078] <pam/#webco> yes, i talked to him, about psoft authorizations right?
1088536651 [3089] <pam/#webco> craigl: saic is down, can you get it pls?
1088538205 [3095] <pam/#webco> andrei reported a double booked resource, on two orders, can't find any reason for it so I am going to open bug with as much info as possible and hope for the best
1088538218 [3097] <pam/#webco> only reported one occurence of it so far
1088539330 [3101] <pam/#webco> indeed
1088542714 [3108] <pam/#webco> we have movers! 8 am saturday morning, I will bring in boxes tomorrow, if any one has personal stuff here they gots to take it home, including anything in the hallway
1088544510 [3122] <pam/#webco> shut up! you rock
1088545966 [3125] <pam/#webco> criagl: ok, go ahead and delete i guess, it still did not deliver anything past 220 pm today
1088546038 [3127] <pam/#webco> I just tried to delete from server through the application, did that work?
1088546120 [3133] <pam/#webco> weird
1088546134 [3135] <pam/#webco> i still did not get your mail sent to usc so can you forward to support again?
1088546136 [3139] <pam/#webco> psl
1088546138 [3141] <pam/#webco> pls
1088546500 [3149] <pam/#webco> yep
1088547700 [3158] <pam/#webco> gracchus: you around?
1088547844 [3164] <pam/#webco> giving it away?
1088547867 [3169] <pam/#webco> can you advise him I am filing a blocker on PIR that just came in from Academyart pls
1088547943 [3174] <pam/#webco> shit, and I just responded to emergency mail, sorry :)
1089133998 [128] <pam/#webco> thanks
1089134481 [134] <pam/#onshored> is there a dance company above us?
1089134620 [138] <pam/#onshored> even better
1089134712 [141] <pam/#webco> looks like we are going to have to schedule evergreen to get an update, they have hit a blocker in the version they are using that is fixed in the latest release, yikes
1089134856 [143] <pam/#webco> they hit the bug where returned items on a partially returned order block the renewal of that order
1089135215 [147] <pam/#webco> criagl: chapman is down, I tried to tunnel in but I am not getting a response, can you check?
1089135319 [151] <pam/#webco> i see you are checking
1089139502 [155] <pam/#webco> no, nada
1089139792 [157] <pam/#webco> craigl: are you working on server stuff or bugs today?
1089142515 [168] <pam/#webco> evergreen?
1089142530 [174] <pam/#webco> o poop, i am on phone right now fyi
1089143483 [179] <pam/#webco> refusenik: do you know what is up with evergreen? off phone now if you need some help
1089143582 [184] <pam/#webco> i tried to tunnel but it does not connect, can you connect? did they just leave msg or did you speak with someone?
1089143634 [194] <pam/#webco> ok, let me know if you need my help
1089143854 [197] <pam/#webco> we still need to discuss the plan for updating evergreen, which I think the first step would be to get an updated instance up for me to test on first since it has been a very long time since they have been updated
1089143903 [202] <pam/#webco> I am also not around for the next two days which would delay this process, craigl can you even guess at how long it would take to get me an update test instance with their data?
1089145116 [210] <pam/#webco> hm, not sure about that, i have not had access since the server went down several weeks ago to the old projex file we used to use which would supply that information
1089151173 [219] <pam/#webco> when I go to http://internal.onshored.com/wwwdist/ I can not find the page where we list out all the clients and their status
1089151223 [221] <pam/#webco> refusenik: did you get chapman back up?
1089151279 [223] <pam/#webco> i still don't get a response if I try to tunnel
1089151430 [229] <pam/#webco> can you do that in a response email to pete pls?
1089152729 [241] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i will be out wed and thrusday, if you could work on the msu agreement form when ever you get done with other more demanding issues I would really appreciate
1089152763 [243] <pam/#webco> and please tell me can make the changes they need on the version they are running so we don't have to update them yet again which will more than liekly cause more more more trauma for them
1089153041 [251] <pam/#webco> ok, i will leave you to try your best and I will forward all Frank Tate mail and phone calls directly to you ;P
1089153221 [253] <pam/#webco> ok, hitting the road, any one want to go to milwaukee for webcheckout training for me?
1089386760 [315] <pam/#onshored> craigl: i have not gotten through the mass amount of support email that  came in over the last three days but can you let me know what you are working on pls?
1089387499 [320] <pam/#webco> pam: craigl: i have not gotten through the mass amount of support email that  came in over the last three days but can you let me know what you are working on pls?
1089387750 [327] <pam/#webco> hello??
1089388326 [331] <pam/#webco> is there any status change on the printing issues for msu, accd or saic?
1089388467 [337] <pam/#webco> is that for usc too?
1089388540 [346] <pam/#webco> who is it for
1089388937 [356] <pam/#webco> refusenik: we are supposed to get evergreen a testing instance of the latest release today, is that something you can do today?
1089389472 [364] <pam/#webco> yes, i agree
1089389480 [366] <pam/#webco> can you fix in 3.0.5/
1089389481 [368] <pam/#webco> ?
1089389493 [372] <pam/#webco> oh wait, wrong one
1089389501 [374] <pam/#webco> UCB or UBC?
1089389517 [376] <pam/#webco> british columbia right?
1089399032 [388] <pam/#webco> refusenik: can you move to the evergreen update now? maybe still working on usc?
1089399600 [397] <pam/#webco> permission granted
1089399738 [401] <pam/#webco> i am going to get me some food
1089404279 [403] <pam/#webco> +
1089405137 [405] <pam/#webco> gracchus: are we milestoning pir bugs to cvs head now?
1089405156 [407] <pam/#webco> new one just came in, probably at least critical, maybe blocker
1089405169 [409] <pam/#webco> if you cancel a reservation from pir interface it does not cancel in webcheckout
1089405325 [412] <pam/#webco> gracchus: or is the mileston current release cycle?
1089407872 [436] <pam/#webco> craigl: saic is down, I have never successfully restared them on my own, can you get it?
1089408142 [443] <pam/#webco> famous last words
1089410349 [445] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i don't understand your comment to andrei about the password of that student not working, I tried it and was denied access to PIR
1089645911 [485] <pam/#webco> craigl: pls advise when you have an answer on msu, I would love to send what eric did to frank for approval
1089646530 [491] <pam/#webco> craigl: pls advise when you know about msu, I would really like to send what eric did to him for approval
1089646795 [499] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i reopened 7431 on PIR, I tried to log in as the student Andrei could not log in as and failed too, maybe I am missing something, i think that would be a blocker too
1089646972 [511] <pam/#webco> gracchus: yes, i tried and failed, then went to the user he provided and re-entered the password he provided and still failed
1089647106 [515] <pam/#webco> craigl: saic is down, sara just callecd
1089647152 [524] <pam/#webco> thanks
1089650878 [541] <pam/#webco> gracchus: email to support from MPT regarding PIR just came in, can you advise an answer pls?
1089655182 [582] <pam/#webco> gracchus: the current bugs in webcheckout that I believe will cause problems for any further updates are milestoned as current release cycle blockers, the ones I believe need to be fixed are 7433, 7442, 7192, 7427, 7207, 7192, please let me know if you disagree with any
1089660096 [588] <pam/#webco> craigl: did that msu instance build
1089660175 [594] <pam/#webco> hm, priting
1089662790 [599] <pam/#webco> ok, do I need to configure anything on the interface for printing or you did that already?
1089662825 [601] <pam/#webco> craigl: i have tried a couple of time to access msu production inst
1089662841 [603] <pam/#webco> instance and it just hangs in the browser, can you take a peek that them and see what is up pls?
1089663210 [609] <pam/#webco> weird
1089663293 [613] <pam/#webco> ok, ill contact frank shortly, do I need to do anything through the interface for printing? i tried to print but nothing happened
1089663319 [619] <pam/#webco> ok, is ours onshored
1089663322 [621] <pam/#webco> ok, printer

1089663979 [643] <pam/#webco> wait, i think i hear a paper feed
1089664001 [645] <pam/#webco> nope, wishful hearing, still nothing
1089664432 [652] <pam/#webco> criagl: that looks good, can i test an invoice and ticket too?
1089664621 [664] <pam/#webco> ok
1089664769 [666] <pam/#webco> ok.. i tried one ticket and one invoice
1089664909 [670] <pam/#webco> criagl that print job didn't come through my email, came through as an unknown file type
1089665027 [681] <pam/#webco> ok
1089665131 [687] <pam/#webco> ok, renaming with pdf worked, is there an invoice one there too?
1089665173 [693] <pam/#webco> i will try again
1089665210 [695] <pam/#webco> ok, just hit print invoice
1089665313 [701] <pam/#webco> hm, actually ticket printing doesnt work correctly, doesnt give all the details
1089665413 [711] <pam/#webco> bravo bravo
1089665429 [713] <pam/#webco> the invoice doesnt come up for me
1089665436 [715] <pam/#webco> maybe confused by the .xls.pdf
1089665752 [723] <pam/#webco> can you send another file?
1089666462 [730] <pam/#webco> scratchs head but trusts craigl
1089666533 [732] <pam/#webco> well i got mail but it was empty
1089668528 [738] <pam/#webco> oh good
1089668781 [743] <pam/#webco> gracchus: no, i was using academyart instance, i can review them on current testing build
1089668786 [745] <pam/#webco> except the migration ones
1089669211 [760] <pam/#webco> oh oh oh oh, there is a filed bug for dups created by psoft but it has not gotten any attention cause craigl is a lazy sob who doesn't do a dang thing :P
1089670312 [772] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i confirmed the errors on the current release cycle, all good but one was invalid cause i ain't so smart
1089670348 [777] <pam/#webco> 9 total PIR and WCO pressing bugs on the current release
1089670518 [779] <pam/#webco> see ya
1089818914 [908] <pam/#webco> craigl: UofSanFran (new customer) has their server, i forwarded details to support
1089818922 [910] <pam/#webco> we will need to schedule the install for them
1089820913 [970] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i would love another testing instance,when ever you get a chance would be fine
1089822769 [976] <pam/#webco> chevalier: the testing boris instance has aau data, not demo data fyi
1089824092 [983] <pam/#webco> gracchus: is this valid functionality or a bug: if a resource is currently checked out and is late for its return the system will return that resource for a valid selected resource if you double click on the resource type name in the applet.  Should the system filter out items that are still checked out on a late return? seems it should, esp in checkout mode, what do you think?
1089824234 [987] <pam/#webco> ok, ill file
1089824990 [1012] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i am getting the An Exception has Occurred error in 9005 pir
1089824999 [1014] <pam/#webco> when I hit the find resource search
1089825046 [1018] <pam/#webco> shoudl I reopen that bug or do you know what it is?
1089829093 [1029] <pam/#webco> craigl: i am going to run down to the old building to check the mail, pls cover support pls pls pls
1089833562 [1067] <pam/#webco> criagl: SCAD is going to be using the Academic Level field in their patron integration (just like artcenter)  Should they just add that field to their drop at the end of the rest but before the unused column?
1089833882 [1075] <pam/#webco> i don't know where it is in artcenters file
1089833906 [1078] <pam/#webco> i need to tell scad where to put it in their tho, i assume it is at the end but I don't want to just tell them to do it on an assumtion
1089833930 [1082] <pam/#webco> thanks
1089834472 [1095] <pam/#webco> what?
1089834543 [1097] <pam/#webco> are you saying that our patron integration and patron import format is no longer valid?
1089834582 [1104] <pam/#webco> well since I currently have 4 new clients implementing it would be really great if I knew that
1089834666 [1108] <pam/#webco> and no way to search for it?
1089834714 [1114] <pam/#webco> well since you are soooo clear with all your comments, really hard to tell
1089834821 [1119] <pam/#webco> what ever the current release cycle is
1089834824 [1121] <pam/#webco> i assume
1089834858 [1128] <pam/#webco> I AM NOT A DEVEL MANAGER I JUST PLAY ONE ON TV
1089834916 [1132] <pam/#webco> the fact is, i don't know, the "process" seems to change weekly so where does that leave me
1089835061 [1136] <pam/#webco> maybe jesse can lend a hand and advise what version is to be released, I no longer understand where we are along the lines of tagging a release and doing point releases to that
1089841093 [1172] <pam/#webco> craigl: i know you are working on migration and accd stuff, when you can, is it possible to update accd testing instance to the latest release?
1089841117 [1177] <pam/#webco> and can you give me an est. of when you think that may be possible?
1089841724 [1182] <pam/#webco> cheavlier: can you see a support email from MPT today? there is some mail issue going on
1089841881 [1184] <pam/#webco> criagl: yo yo\
1089842307 [1189] <pam/#webco> thank you
1089991694 [1280] <pam/#webco> craigl: i have a meeting with artcenter at 1200 and I would really love to be able to tell them their test instance is finally updated, do you think that will be possible?
1089992396 [1289] <pam/#webco> what part was the joke? i meant 12 central, i am good at simple addition and subtraction so converting time zones only confuses me for a few moments
1089992829 [1302] <pam/#webco> sweet thanks
1089993748 [1306] <pam/#webco> criagl: ucal seemed to send in a quite serious blocker bug late on wed but I see no response from you yesterday, did you talk to them on the phone or anything?
1089993965 [1320] <pam/#webco> craigl: did you miss it or ignore it?
1089994145 [1328] <pam/#webco> for sure
1089997336 [1353] <pam/#webco> craigl: i need to see an order which has an artcenter resource that is a kit to see if the agreement form has everything they need, there requirements are that each piece of a kit is listed and every accessory is listed, hard to tel on the exmp you sent
1089997382 [1357] <pam/#webco> ok, any resource that has componants (contains other pieces) and has accessorys will do the trick
1089997450 [1359] <pam/#onshored> hi adam!
1089997500 [1361] <pam/#webco> hm, seems to be some marble bowling going on upstairs
1089997583 [1370] <pam/#webco> craigl: do you know if eric finished the ticket form?
1089997705 [1381] <pam/#webco> k
1089997765 [1383] <pam/#onshored> no, finding our 2000 will take me about 15 min, getting onshore to do, one can only guess
1090003646 [1403] <pam/#webco> eric: andrei phone number 415.274.8630
1090003721 [1406] <pam/#webco> there are no rtypes in the applet for artcenter test instance
1090003747 [1408] <pam/#webco> and only 158 resources
1090003752 [1410] <pam/#webco> when I do a search in find resources
1090003756 [1412] <pam/#webco> for media services
1090004392 [1415] <pam/#webco> there are some remaining issues with migration I would guess?
1090004429 [1417] <pam/#webco> craigl: in my conversation with Rik it appears that it would be best for them to start with the clean up of the simple information of the resources first and then go through the clean up of resource types in the interface after that is complete
1090004446 [1419] <pam/#webco> when do you think we can have a dump of the resources for them to work with?
1090006265 [1425] <pam/#webco> craigl: ok, we'll see if we can do that once the testing instance is back up and they have a chance to review it
1090006281 [1427] <pam/#webco> craigl: thanks for being a part of the meeting with rik, it was very helpful
1090006799 [1433] <pam/#webco> that was the best part
1090009308 [1440] <pam/#webco> craigl: there is more missing data on invoices, I am going to add to the bug
1090009350 [1444] <pam/#webco> um, like everything except the patron name!
1090009471 [1448] <pam/#webco> ew, that is unfortunate, empty empty invoices
1090009837 [1452] <pam/#webco> but not the history, credits/charge, no relevent dates, no history so its about half empty
1090009898 [1456] <pam/#webco> i don't knwo what invoice_line is
1090012160 [1467] <pam/#webco> well I would say you have identified the problemo then
1090016842 [1475] <pam/#webco> phone craigl
1090016857 [1481] <pam/#webco> phone refusenik
1090250761 [1496] <pam/#webco> do we have an up to date testing instance for the latest release?
1090250810 [1508] <pam/#webco> ucla is getting an error so they are going to need an update which means i need to test the view by location feature a little, ick
1090250815 [1510] <pam/#webco> thanks
1090250840 [1514] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1090252969 [1520] <pam/#webco> it would be helpful if it is not a pain
1090254044 [1527] <pam/#webco> gracchus: there was something wrong with the applet for artcenter testing instance on friday, applet took forever to load, you had said you knew what was causing and would fix, is it fixed?
1090254078 [1531] <pam/#webco> ok
1090254193 [1537] <pam/#webco> ok, cause it doesnt ever seem to load and it I type in a patron name i get the bad user, no patron matches error even tho I know they are there, part of the same issue?
1090255509 [1542] <pam/#webco> I had the 7021 phone number removed from the hunt so it can be used as a fax without conflicting with the phone system, it should take effect some time this week
1090262893 [1556] <pam/#webco> ok, if there is some place to test pls let me know
1090262936 [1561] <pam/#webco> ok
1090269230 [1691] <pam/#webco> gracchus: pertty pertty, crapplet seems to load both resource types and patrons fine now
1090269291 [1695] <pam/#webco> oh yeah, one of the invoice tables did not migrate
1090269316 [1700] <pam/#webco> there is an open bug for it...i look
1090269418 [1702] <pam/#webco> 7192
1090270464 [1712] <pam/#webco> craigl: not sure about when we will be updating ucla, i really need to test a little of the view by location feature in the applet of the latest release before we can give that to them
1090270526 [1721] <pam/#webco> craigl: bug 7353 does require msu update, we should check with eric, he was dealing with frank and I am not sure where they left off with the agreement/tickets printing issue
1090270556 [1725] <pam/#webco> gracchus: great! if you have a testing instance with ucla data I will be happy to give it a once over too
1090271413 [1733] <pam/#webco> craigl: covad number is 888.642.6823 and our account numbert is 109611, we don't really have a client rep, just call the number and they should be able to help you.  They may ask you the "secret"
1090271438 [1737] <pam/#webco> message which is where eric was born, answer cincinnati
1090422321 [1895] <pam/#webco> hello
1090423380 [1905] <pam/#webco> howdy
1090423790 [1911] <pam/#webco> oh ok, so their testing instance is not up, pls advise when it is
1090425257 [1931] <pam/#webco> spinning?
1090425271 [1933] <pam/#webco> physically or mentally?
1090425326 [1937] <pam/#webco> i thought it may be difficult which is why I gave the example of the testing vs. production behavior
1090425399 [1939] <pam/#webco> so you need me to show you what i mean?
1090425449 [1941] <pam/#webco> craigl: i don't think i ever got a clear response from you on how you would like sfsu to send their large data file
1090426392 [1947] <pam/#webco> craigl: karl and I found the bug that has the patch for the set/strike 3.0.5 error that uwm sent it, i reopened and assigned to you to apply patch for them
1090426685 [1954] <pam/#webco> craigl: i don't follow what you did do for york, you reset something or reentered something for user moazzem?
1090427002 [1967] <pam/#webco> craigl: the admin pword i have for york doesnt seem to be working either
1090432441 [1995] <pam/#webco> criagl: we need to coordinate an install for SCAD, Robby knox sent an email to support with the contact information of the IT person there.  When you are done with support fires can you contact him please?
1090432785 [2003] <pam/#webco> o yah, like that will stop me
1090433631 [2005] <pam/#webco> craigl: an email came in from james at evergreen asking about server reboot problems they have, it is all yours when you have a chance :)
1090436330 [2023] <pam/#webco> demo is getting bad gateway and I could really use it to review some things with a poor poor soul at scad, can someone kick it for me or is the problem bigger than that?
1090436498 [2029] <pam/#webco> not sure demo.webcheckout.net/wco is where I was trying
1090437086 [2039] <pam/#webco> thanks very much
1090445406 [2104] <pam/#webco> criagl: looks like champlain is ready for install next week as well, how would you prefer we schedule installs?  do you want me to leave it to you to schedule with their IT folks or what?
1090445420 [2106] <pam/#webco> currently we have SCAD and Champlain ready for install and soon USFCA will also be ready
1090445587 [2112] <pam/#webco> i was referring to scheduling your time
1090445703 [2124] <pam/#webco> hehe
1090445753 [2128] <pam/#webco> craigl: so you really don't need any information from a client other than a password
1090445765 [2130] <pam/#webco> remember, you must be very specfic with the webcheckout monkey
1090445774 [2134] <pam/#webco> ah, see, I knew there was more
1091027798 [577] <pam/#webco> craigl: did the artcenter testing instance get updated?
1091028198 [583] <pam/#webco> gracchus: are the specifics I need to know about the testing site for artcenter?
1091028261 [587] <pam/#webco> criagl: what are you working on?
1091028610 [599] <pam/#webco> scad too?
1091028616 [601] <pam/#webco> that guy bard did contact us
1091028698 [611] <pam/#webco> can you show me how to access passes.xml.gpg?
1091028704 [613] <pam/#webco> thanks by the way!
1091029171 [625] <pam/#webco> ok, eric will take care of showing me
1091029374 [633] <pam/#webco> that url doesnt work for me
1091029403 [637] <pam/#webco> ok
1091029432 [639] <pam/#webco> did you even contact the IT guy you were dealing with that installation is complete?
1091029899 [651] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i can see that the invoice migration problem did not get addressed for artcenter if in deed their testing instance was updated, can you please advise me of the status of this?
1091030527 [661] <pam/#webco> gracchus: no sign of karl :(
1091031434 [667] <pam/#webco> gracchus: ok, when you have an idea about artcenter pls advise, their update is holding up both their inventory and their instance split
1091032882 [673] <pam/#webco> karl: http://prep.onshored.com:80/snipsnap/space/start
1091034550 [690] <pam/#webco> eric: ucla is dealing with some annoying servlett thread errors on their current build, view by location is not working in the current release cycle but I got chris to agree to take an update without that feature working and I did not suggest a testing instance to him
1091034586 [694] <pam/#webco> eric: so if all goes well enough with my testing, can you add ucla to get an update sometime next week, straight to production, no test instance?
1091036844 [750] <pam/#webco> criagl: on phone, pls do get petes emails
1091039033 [814] <pam/#webco> http://prep.onshored.com/cgi-bin/bugzilla/index.cgi
1091039240 [817] <pam/#webco> craigl: trying to tunnel to chapman and getting chapman: http://prep.onshored.com:31468/wco
1091039240 [821] <pam/#webco> : support@prep:~$; Unknown cipher type 'm'
1091039257 [824] <pam/#webco> any idea?
1091039291 [834] <pam/#webco> ok
1091039619 [842] <pam/#webco> tried to tunnel ucla, got same error
1091040062 [846] <pam/#webco> craigl: still error, should i close console and open a new one?
1091043315 [871] <pam/#webco> craigl: pete called and would like you to call him back when you are done with lunch
1091048814 [1082] <pam/#webco> did a test instance for me ever surface today?
1091050118 [1120] <pam/#webco> gracchus: great thanks
1091050151 [1123] <pam/#webco> what is the applet data thing? will that delay them getting un update to their testing instance at artcenter.webcheckout.net/311/wco?
1091050268 [1127] <pam/#webco> oh, i see a problem in applet, with subtypes, is that what you are working on?
1091050326 [1129] <pam/#webco> the checkout centers on the log in page list in some random order now, that is annoying
1091050893 [1137] <pam/#webco> ok
1091052248 [1145] <pam/#webco> phone gracchus
1091114253 [1193] <pam/#webco> hola
1091115204 [1201] <pam/#webco> great, thanks jesse
1091115432 [1203] <pam/#webco> criagl: i do have one of the depatments at scad resource import files, do you want to test with that and try to get the import working before we have to do the big one next week?
1091115758 [1214] <pam/#webco> I am going to put them in a file in my drop box, can you get?
1091115763 [1216] <pam/#webco> i just did i mean
1091115879 [1224] <pam/#webco> yes
1091115910 [1226] <pam/#webco> ok, now in public
1091116174 [1240] <pam/#webco> 00:50:e4:50:82:3a
1091116223 [1246] <pam/#webco> sexy, i know
1091116438 [1254] <pam/#webco> gracchus: is there a testing instance or is that remigrating?  i went to the release testing link on snip snap but the instance there has no data
1091119409 [1289] <pam/#webco> cool, let me know if you get them up to an instance
1091122562 [1304] <pam/#webco> not that I know of, give me some time :)
1091123197 [1310] <pam/#webco> what does?
1091124705 [1316] <pam/#webco> criagl: um, not sure, do we just do that, is it a lot of work?
1091132115 [1436] <pam/#webco> o, sorry, was concentrating on other stuffs
1091132137 [1440] <pam/#webco> you should private msg me if I don't respond to you in a decent time
1091132146 [1442] <pam/#webco> where to mister?
1091132213 [1448] <pam/#webco> ok, one sec
1091133444 [1459] <pam/#webco> craigl: still working on test run of import?
1091133463 [1463] <pam/#webco> is it messy or not so bad
1091133540 [1469] <pam/#webco> k
1091137893 [1492] <pam/#webco> craigl: are there any characters in the resource import that are not accepted?
1091138474 [1502] <pam/#webco> is there something wrong with mail?  i am on phone with trina and she is sending mail but i am not getting it
1091139206 [1511] <pam/#webco> bye
1091459385 [1726] <pam/#webco> morning
1091459788 [1741] <pam/#webco> criagl: what is the status of the resource import? did you get that sample from scad to load?
1091460186 [1763] <pam/#webco> criagl: can you give me an estimate?  The scad files are all in now and I have a due date for us to load them for review by this wed
1091460212 [1766] <pam/#webco> also this week we need to get with their IT peeps to get the patron file drop up and running
1091460231 [1768] <pam/#webco> fyi, SCAD does not want to be on a split instance at this time because they do want to share hold data
1091460467 [1780] <pam/#webco> criagl: ok
1091460962 [1807] <pam/#webco> criagl: i just reopend bug 7386, you only half fixed it
1091461747 [1860] <pam/#webco> gracchus: the artcenter testing instance still has wacked out allocation ID and missing invoice data, I would really like to schedule an update to their production instance this week, we have many action itmes waiting on this and it has gone on and on and on for weeks now
1091461784 [1863] <pam/#webco> if you can advise that these items indeed are fixed even though they are not on their testing instance I would be satified with that and schedule the update with artcenter, what do you think?
1091462108 [1880] <pam/#webco> criagl: i opened bug 7469 for scad patron filedrop, file location is in the bug, pls advise if you need more than what the client provided
1091462152 [1885] <pam/#webco> yes, ucla also needs an update this week, current build, I assume that is what 56 is
1091462159 [1887] <pam/#webco> that was for gracchus
1091462950 [1905] <pam/#webco> craigl: champlain install was one that was completed or no?
1091467054 [1943] <pam/#webco> craigl: chapman is down, tried to restart, here is what the terminal says
1091467055 [1945] <pam/#webco> webcheckout@ftvwco:/wcodata/webcheckout $ wcoctrl stop
1091467055 [1947] <pam/#webco> 9084
1091467055 [1949] <pam/#webco> (WCO server not running).
1091467055 [1951] <pam/#webco> webcheckout@ftvwco:/wcodata/webcheckout $ wcoctrl start
1091467055 [1953] <pam/#webco> 9084
1091467057 [1956] <pam/#webco> ;;; detachtty: 1091466827: Is "run/wco.socket" a dead socket from a previous run?
1091467059 [1958] <pam/#webco> ;;; detachtty: 1091466827: FATAL bind (Address already in use)
1091467062 [1960] <pam/#webco> WCO server started.
1091467063 [1962] <pam/#webco> Jetty HTTP server started.
1091467065 [1964] <pam/#webco> webcheckout@ftvwco:/wcodata/webcheckout $ 
1091467067 [1966] <pam/#webco> can you advise what this mean?
1091467070 [1970] <pam/#webco> s
1091467093 [1972] <pam/#webco> does say webco server started but the rest of it freaked me out
1091467115 [1976] <pam/#webco> even tho it does eventually say server started?
1091467154 [1980] <pam/#webco> any need to wcoctrl stop first?
1091467195 [1984] <pam/#webco> k, thanks, appears to be restarting
1091467886 [1986] <pam/#webco> karl: after you tunnel to client you need to restart client using 3.1 these are the commands you need:
1091467892 [1988] <pam/#webco> wcoctrol stop
1091467897 [1990] <pam/#webco> wcoctrol start
1091473633 [2006] <pam/#webco> karl: are you going to take a stab at the support email from john snyder?
1091473651 [2009] <pam/#webco> you should assume you are first stop for support email and then get me to assist you
1091473659 [2011] <pam/#webco> when needed
1091475665 [2019] <pam/#webco> no
1091475677 [2021] <pam/#webco> i never discussed any of the server stuff with him
1091477852 [2027] <pam/#webco> what do you mean?
1091477913 [2031] <pam/#webco> yes
1091477915 [2034] <pam/#webco> that is true
1091477979 [2040] <pam/#webco> all charges go through sales so if someone needs a fresh install or anything outside of standard "I am getting x behavior from system and should by y" type support you should check with sales to make sure we are/are not going to charge for the work
1091477993 [2044] <pam/#webco> dan is sales on almost all clients
1091478025 [2050] <pam/#webco> you do not ever, and did I say ever? discuss pricing with clients, completely dan/eric
1091478037 [2054] <pam/#webco> no, john is having a support issue, I don't understand
1091478050 [2056] <pam/#webco> read IRC, craigl and I were talking about biola
1091478058 [2058] <pam/#webco> for reinstall from scratch
1091478129 [2064] <pam/#webco> no apologizes necessary, its really not a problem 
1091478313 [2067] <pam/#webco> you can ususally tell what client an email is from from the email address, john snyder is from chapman
1091479313 [2075] <pam/#webco> do we have a current release testing instance?
1091479318 [2077] <pam/#webco> the one on snip snap has no data
1091479451 [2082] <pam/#webco> the link on release testing link at snip snap is boris:8081
1091479701 [2086] <pam/#webco> gracchus: do you know?
1091479730 [2089] <pam/#webco> craigl: what am i supposed to do with those keys you sent?
1091479871 [2095] <pam/#webco> i dont know what any of that means, I need to know how to get to the passes file, that is all
1091480257 [2103] <pam/#webco> gracchus: the testing instance I go to from snip snap for release has no data in it for testing purposes, can't test without data, can we load it with demo data or something?
1091481126 [2115] <pam/#webco> thank you gracchus
1091482543 [2127] <pam/#webco> craigl: what is the wcoctrl pass command for admin pwords again?
1091482819 [2133] <pam/#webco> craigl: wcoctrl password doesnt work on scad install, i get webcheck@webcheck:~/webcheckout/WEB-INF $ wcoctrl password
1091482819 [2135] <pam/#webco> webcheck@webcheck:~/webcheckout/WEB-INF $
1091483321 [2139] <pam/#webco> ok
1091484658 [2151] <pam/#webco> karl: yes, looks ok, altho you should add that we tried to run it manually from the processess tab on the org detail screen and it failed there also
1091485513 [2163] <pam/#webco> thanks karl
1091485790 [2167] <pam/#webco> no problem
1091485795 [2169] <pam/#webco> im melting
1091633464 [2457] <pam/#webco> criagl: thanks for the pears!
1091639466 [2498] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i just spoke to Larry at aau and he says he is still getting the screen jitters pretty bad on his computer.  I don't see it all on mine but he is on PC/W2k and I am on the Mac, is there any kind of setting or something I can tell him that I am missing?
1091639754 [2502] <pam/#webco> there does seem to be some poopy applet problems with AAU, requesting by type hangs up for minutes and minutes, can't scoll the timeline scheduler to see items on an order cause the applet seems to be searching the dbase for something but I can't tell what
1091639817 [2512] <pam/#webco> i am sure I am using the wrong terminology
1091639831 [2514] <pam/#webco> gracchus: do you want to look at my screen to see what I am talking about?
1091639852 [2516] <pam/#webco> craigl: the applet jitters or loading of request by rtype?
1091640022 [2520] <pam/#webco> craigl: thanks but we will leave it for now, it was me testing, not them reporting anything so I don't want to distract you from your large list of stuffs
1091642892 [2541] <pam/#webco> karl: i do have safari but i am not sure how much testing i would have to do to figure out if safari crashes, esp. since he says it only happened once since they started using safari, that could have been any random thing
1091645438 [2589] <pam/#onshored> kristine!!!
1091646273 [2597] <pam/#webco> criagl: i already filed that as a bug
1091646279 [2602] <pam/#webco> cool
1091646314 [2605] <pam/#webco> how are we deploying fixes? when we have one they get it or wait for update?
1091646346 [2607] <pam/#webco> karl: sorry, i should have told you i opened a bug for that too
1091646402 [2611] <pam/#webco> ill leave that to eric to decide urgency and if it should interrupt you
1091647299 [2616] <pam/#webco> craigl: does it matter if I leave a blank record between departments on the spreadsheet i am creating that brings all scad departments into one file?
1091647374 [2620] <pam/#webco> sorry, yes
1091647418 [2622] <pam/#webco> so basically will a blank row in excel break anything?
1091647471 [2626] <pam/#webco> ok, i can do that, thought you would only want to run the import once for them but leaving them seperate is actually easier for me, no work at all :) my favorite!
1091647516 [2633] <pam/#webco> ok, i will go through their files and make sure to remove any if they put them in
1091647632 [2639] <pam/#webco> ok, i can check for that as well
1091647767 [2648] <pam/#webco> actually, the template I have on file has "authorization required" not authorization-required, pls advise how you would like it and if any of the other fields are not they way  you want
1091647799 [2654] <pam/#webco> k
1091650337 [2678] <pam/#webco> karl: do you want to take a stab at the email from Rich Hyland from usc reporting a bug?
1091650871 [2686] <pam/#webco> karl: sorry, didn't notice he sent it to me directly, i am forwarding now
1091650879 [2688] <pam/#webco> to support
1091652340 [2711] <pam/#webco> craigl: i don't know what you mean by remove org qualifier
1091652380 [2716] <pam/#webco> i don't see any resources there, maybe i am missing something
1091652410 [2718] <pam/#webco> o resource types
1091652417 [2720] <pam/#webco> sorry, thought you said resources
1091652457 [2722] <pam/#webco> looks good so far
1091653083 [2728] <pam/#webco> yeah, i got it, thanks
1091653114 [2730] <pam/#webco> chevalier: not sure when you are scheduling demos dave at evergreen advised this afternoon that demo is not working correctly so it needs updating 
1091655865 [2750] <pam/#webco> karl: i don't know if there is a first part of that thought that didnt make it into irc but i don't know who/what your taking to/about
1091655949 [2753] <pam/#webco> criagl: i have placed an alias to my SCAD import file folder in my Public file for you
1091655986 [2757] <pam/#webco> craigl: I have one folder for each scad department (there are four), each folder has the tree files from that department. 
1091656033 [2761] <pam/#webco> craigl: one department has not sent me all their files so they are not ready but you are free to load the others once the import is working, the department that is not ready is in the folder marked DMoreland Department - NOT COMPLETE YET
1091656117 [2767] <pam/#webco> 68.166.153.107
1091656243 [2783] <pam/#webco> sure, no problem
1091656384 [2787] <pam/#webco> ok, copy now instead of alias
1091656434 [2791] <pam/#webco> i do try
1091656636 [2810] <pam/#webco> yes, as long as caps don't matter
1091656692 [2814] <pam/#webco> craigl: where did you leave biola after that call on monday? they did something and erased their instance of software, is that with sales or do we need to schedule another install?
1091656741 [2820] <pam/#webco> ok, cool
1091656968 [2844] <pam/#webco> craigl: ok
1091657614 [2894] <pam/#webco> criagl: here is my ip now 68.166.153.125
1091657839 [2898] <pam/#webco> karl: did you ever look at the email I forwarded to support from Rich Hyland
1091657842 [2900] <pam/#webco> ?
1091657955 [2904] <pam/#webco> i am restarting chapman
1091660969 [2920] <pam/#webco> going home
1091805891 [3136] <pam/#webco> criagl: what is the status of resource import?
1091806079 [3140] <pam/#webco> yes yes
1091806089 [3143] <pam/#webco> where is it?
1091806103 [3152] <pam/#webco> how long will that take and when?
1091806187 [3156] <pam/#webco> ok, the one remaining department has sent in their files.  They have several different orgs/checkoutcenters in the same file, will that be a problem?
1091806231 [3162] <pam/#webco> i don't know if that is possible
1091806238 [3165] <pam/#webco> without a lot of work from  me
1091809729 [3202] <pam/#webco> craigl: i put up a new SCAD file for you to get in my Public directory.  I split the final department into four sets of three files so that each org has its own import
1091809969 [3210] <pam/#webco> yeah
1091810033 [3212] <pam/#webco> it was kevin from champlain, they also managed to screw up their installation by doing some kind of server update and need some troubleshooting/reinstall, oy these people
1091810047 [3214] <pam/#webco> i will work with eric to schedule champlain and biola next week
1091814686 [3246] <pam/#webco> craigl: i have just now had an opportunity to check your instance for scad import data and I got an error, not sure if it should still be available for me to view or not
1091815477 [3252] <pam/#webco> i am getting mail for dag, do we have a forwarding address for him
1091816117 [3264] <pam/#webco> criagl: i am trying to copy and past but i think it is too large, want to come look?
1091817107 [3270] <pam/#webco> i am going to the bank and to get some lunch
1091821783 [3292] <pam/#webco> criagl: i have to send some data to a couple of clients with patron filedrop integration coming up and the last time I sent the info you didn't like it cause it was only for internal or didn't describe their options to your liking, does this ring a bell?
1091821814 [3294] <pam/#webco> I don't really want to interupt your list of to dos so will you kill me if I continue to use what I have for a few more clients
1091821924 [3298] <pam/#webco> ok
1091824133 [3312] <pam/#webco> sighs
1091824282 [3321] <pam/#webco> what is unclear?
1091824311 [3325] <pam/#webco> they have four department, all departments have their own folders which contain three files for import from that department
1091824323 [3329] <pam/#webco> except for the fourth department, which I split up because you asked me to
1091824338 [3331] <pam/#webco> o, sorry, I just didn't change the name of that folder
1091824379 [3335] <pam/#webco> it is complete so there are four sub-folders in that department with three files each
1091825168 [3342] <pam/#webco> craigl: my irc client crashed, you said evergreen test instance is up? can you advise where again pls?
1091825361 [3347] <pam/#webco> tunnel to what name then in the terminal?
1091825561 [3351] <pam/#webco> thanks
1091825621 [3355] <pam/#webco> craigl: i get ssh: evergreen311: Name or service not known
1091825697 [3360] <pam/#webco> thank you
1091826001 [3363] <pam/#webco> craigl: there are no rtypes in the applet of the evergreen testing instance
1091826194 [3370] <pam/#webco> you mean are there resources?
1091826200 [3372] <pam/#webco> yes, and patrons
1091826213 [3376] <pam/#webco> but they should have the usage fee module enabled and that is not
1091826250 [3379] <pam/#webco> yes there are rtypes
1091827500 [3383] <pam/#webco> not for the person trying to organize 7 differnet departments files, me
1091828217 [3391] <pam/#webco> can you identify which department?
1091828236 [3399] <pam/#webco> ok, ill check it out
1091828298 [3401] <pam/#webco> in the resource file?
1091828313 [3405] <pam/#webco> ok
1091828388 [3415] <pam/#webco> ok, you are going to fix it so I do not have to right?
1091828439 [3421] <pam/#webco> well if they did something weird we will pass it back to them to fix
1091829263 [3426] <pam/#webco> advised evergreen of the testing instance and let them know we are aware of the rtypes problem but they can test other sectionso of the software and we will fix the applet on Monday
1092063639 [3476] <pam/#webco> criagl: what are you working on now?
1092063815 [3483] <pam/#webco> craigl: what are you working on now?
1092064066 [3489] <pam/#webco> are you trying to be funny or a jerk?
1092064073 [3491] <pam/#webco> hard to tell in irc
1092064178 [3497] <pam/#webco> thank you
1092064204 [3505] <pam/#webco> what are the problems?
1092064461 [3516] <pam/#webco> ok
1092065584 [3520] <pam/#webco> craigl: sorry to report there is still one thing wrong with evergreen.  The invoice module, or usage fees or what ever it is called is not enabled and it should be
1092065616 [3524] <pam/#webco> thank you
1092066218 [3527] <pam/#webco> criagl: this is the only one in your scad email i don't understand
1092066219 [3531] <pam/#webco> Allowed characters are 0x09 (tab), and the range 0x20 (space) - 0x7E (tilde)
1092067951 [3537] <pam/#webco> criagl: in reference to date fields, is the format MM/DD/YY valid?
1092067962 [3540] <pam/#webco> this is what our documentation says about dates Dates should be entered in the format MM/DD/YYYY, MM/DD/YY, or even MM/DD or M/D.
1092067966 [3542] <pam/#webco> is that still true?
1092068026 [3549] <pam/#webco> we have documentation posted on both resource and patron imports, its just our "format" changed
1092068044 [3553] <pam/#webco> can you just tell me what is acceptable please
1092068136 [3559] <pam/#webco> ok
1092068306 [3561] <pam/#webco> of course it has to be the one format that does not exist in excel, god )(&(*^&)(^&(*&%*&%
1092068474 [3572] <pam/#webco> are you saying we can make it work to match what is published as our documentation?
1092068731 [3578] <pam/#webco> ok, then can we make it accept MM/DD/YY, MM/DD/YYYY or do I need to change the way they have their dates
1092068845 [3586] <pam/#webco> so you are preparing to protect them from the year 3000? I am pretty sure we will blow ourselves up by then
1092069198 [3601] <pam/#webco> criagl: i figured out easy way to convert to yyyy/mm/dd, is the / ok instead of -, i can change to dash if it is better
1092069423 [3605] <pam/#webco> very easy, i will change
1092071251 [3614] <pam/#webco> ok, i went to those fields, couldn't see anything odd so I deleted what appeared to be empty character before #01 and put in space character, do you think that worked?
1092071826 [3623] <pam/#webco> ok, I am waiting for a call back from one of the departments but I think I have fixed all of the problems you reported except for the " character which you are fixing
1092071844 [3627] <pam/#webco> I will let you know when I place the corrected file in my public folder for you
1092071850 [3632] <pam/#webco> do you want me to rename the files?
1092071887 [3638] <pam/#webco> pls tell me what you want specifically
1092071948 [3642] <pam/#webco> ok
1092071971 [3646] <pam/#webco> yep, got it
1092075192 [3652] <pam/#webco> craigl: not sure if you are still working on resource import code but as a reminder we also owe SCAD the patron file drop (was due friday but we didn't hit the deadline)
1092076966 [3660] <pam/#webco> i am having trouble getting the date format to save, i reformat but every time i resave it loses the format, very frustrating
1092077558 [3668] <pam/#webco> craigl: eric helped me figure it out, the new folders/files are in my public directory
1092078047 [3674] <pam/#webco> does that mean file drop integration is complete?
1092078191 [3690] <pam/#webco> craigl: the bug says patron file drop
1092078239 [3694] <pam/#webco> ok, then don't say the bug says something it does not
1092078427 [3707] <pam/#webco> that is fine, im not trying to be a pain, if you say the bug only says patron import it is very different from saying the bug says patron file drop but you havnt gotten to it yet, there is no place in the bug that says patron import for review, it say patron file drop for reveiw, very different, as long as we are clear about what needs to be done it is fine
1092080579 [3711] <pam/#webco> criagl: want me to make notes to the bug about problems with patron load or into irc?
1092081257 [3719] <pam/#webco> criagl: many problems with patron data, pls see bug and advise so I can contact the client if there are problems with their data
1092082061 [3725] <pam/#webco> criagl: are talking resources or patron file?
1092082085 [3729] <pam/#webco> we did, did I miss a file?  I was having trouble with the date format saving correctly
1092082149 [3733] <pam/#webco> and we agreed yyyy-mm-dd, if you want yyyy/mm/dd then pls let me know
1092082402 [3743] <pam/#webco> do you know where the bad date is coming from?
1092082694 [3748] <pam/#webco> ok, one of the date fields in FTS resource.csv did not save correctly.  I saved again and I think it looks ok, sorry, pls try again
1092087298 [3764] <pam/#webco> criagl: ok, i will have them correct the patron class field
1092089329 [3766] <pam/#webco> going home, back for more fun tomorrow
1092152970 [3833] <pam/#webco> morning
1092153966 [3840] <pam/#webco> craigl: scad placed a corrected patron file on their server with hopefully the correct patron classes
1092154110 [3845] <pam/#webco> woo hoo, I think we can work on the origin thing as a filed bug and not delay getting the resources loaded, what do you think?
1092154304 [3851] <pam/#webco> I wasn't thinking dependency, more of a time management issue
1092154377 [3857] <pam/#webco> yes yes, I wasn't implying to change what you are working on
1092155338 [3866] <pam/#webco> craigl: if I go in to scad instance and add some of their employees as patron/operators manually will that work get over-written when you run the resource and/or patron imports again?
1092155397 [3870] <pam/#webco> ok, i will wait to do it then
1092155413 [3874] <pam/#webco> np
1092158306 [3890] <pam/#webco> ok
1092158674 [3894] <pam/#webco> just to confirm, 3.1.2 is still compatible with RH 7.3? Max from Concordia asking
1092158744 [3898] <pam/#webco> ok
1092160622 [3901] <pam/#webco> ucla notified, woo woo
1092161530 [3909] <pam/#webco> criagl: i don't suppose you can tell where the bad date format is coming from?
1092163828 [3919] <pam/#webco> craigl: i figured out where the bad dates were coming from
1092164507 [3921] <pam/#webco> criagl: made corrections to SCPT and MTJW resource-type file headers
1092164524 [3923] <pam/#webco> craigl: made corrections to FTS dates that were in wrong format
1092164531 [3925] <pam/#webco> pls advise next step
1092164557 [3929] <pam/#webco> k
1092164624 [3931] <pam/#webco> montgomery rtype file headers fixed
1092164653 [3937] <pam/#webco> checking
1092164835 [3939] <pam/#webco> FTS/resource.csv "capacity" problem was with data being duplicated into fields it didn't belong too, I corrected
1092164927 [3946] <pam/#webco> ok, all files i mentioned above have been corrected and saved to folder in my public directory
1092164939 [3948] <pam/#webco> I opened from there too so any changes you made were intact
1092165129 [3952] <pam/#webco> it appears blank in the spread sheet, not sure what that is
1092165137 [3954] <pam/#webco> I will delete field and see if that helps
1092165285 [3958] <pam/#webco> mont resource-type file corrected and resaved
1092165442 [3964] <pam/#webco> corrected and resaved
1092165586 [3970] <pam/#webco> not sure what that is then, the field appears empty, I will check in csv format instead of excel
1092165770 [3972] <pam/#webco> i don't see it in text/edit application either, can you tell what that is?
1092165968 [3980] <pam/#webco> ok
1092165982 [3984] <pam/#webco> k
1092165993 [3986] <pam/#webco> starts to prey
1092166002 [3988] <pam/#webco> or pray
1092166198 [3992] <pam/#webco> mmmm, food
1092166223 [3994] <pam/#webco> criagl: shall we order something or did you bring lunch?
1092166260 [3998] <pam/#webco> I am pretty sure i could talk eric into putting some lunch on the company since we are such dedicated hard working folks :)
1092169829 [4027] <pam/#webco> here I go to test test test, weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
1092170085 [4030] <pam/#webco> gracchus: is head utexas data?

1092170815 [4133] <pam/#webco> giggles and then goes to file bugs
1092171344 [4156] <pam/#webco> um, no, is that sarcasm?
1092171384 [4160] <pam/#webco> phew
1092171788 [4165] <pam/#webco> something else went wrong with the checkout center/org creaion of Montgomery Hall/Montgomery Cage
1092171813 [4169] <pam/#webco> it ended up as a checkout center of IDUS, looks like IDUS - FRONT DESKMontgomery Hall,Montgomery Cage
1092172503 [4173] <pam/#webco> criagl: I am just going to list things I see here
1092172512 [4175] <pam/#webco> resources do not have checkout centers
1092172521 [4177] <pam/#webco> resource types do not have organizations
1092172682 [4179] <pam/#webco> resource types are hosed, example, resource type "private studio" has hundreds of subtypes in the interface and it is actually a subtype of a root for PHOTO with not subtypes at all, it is the last entry in the PHOTO r-type file so maybe related to what you were saying about not ending character or something?
1092172843 [4181] <pam/#webco> I removed the checkout center search criteria from interface and did a search in Find Resources, got 1125 records, montgomery hall along has over 2800 resources, clearly many resources did not make it in
1092173958 [4187] <pam/#webco> ok
1092173976 [4191] <pam/#webco> k
1092174842 [4195] <pam/#webco> criagl: I have brad grant from scad on phone, he would like to talk to you, is that ok?
1092174995 [4199] <pam/#webco> i lost him, i tried calling back but got vmail, left him info to contact us back
1092175291 [4201] <pam/#webco> weird, wonder if i freaked him out
1092175581 [4206] <pam/#webco> craigl: here is his contact info if there are still problems and you havn't heard from him by the morning: Brad Grant, Director of Network Services, 912-525-4030, bgrant@scad.edu
1092175676 [4210] <pam/#webco> ok
1092175679 [4212] <pam/#webco> i need to go
1092175738 [4220] <pam/#webco> ok, are you fixing or is it with data?
1092237246 [4293] <pam/#webco> eric: the patron import is the same except Academic Level field goes after the last data field but before the empty or Unused field
1092237370 [4298] <pam/#webco> craigl: when we left off last night you were ready to show me another load of resources for scad but got an error wehn starting scad/wco, got anything to show me this morning?
1092237422 [4305] <pam/#webco> ok
1092239877 [4319] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i found a servlett thread error, I but that one in bugzilla and assigned it to you
1092240002 [4323] <pam/#webco> gracchus: when I logged back into the HEAD the data I was searching on before I got the error is still in the search criteria even though I logged in again from another browser window, is that to be expected behavior?
1092240397 [4329] <pam/#webco> gracchus: that does cause a security problem.  If an Operator closes the browser window they are working in and then another operator comes to same computer, or worse, someone who is not an operator in webcheckout, and they load the application they get immediately logged in
1092240440 [4331] <pam/#webco> criagl: still waiting application to start, everything ok with it?
1092240557 [4341] <pam/#webco> currently, if you close the browser window you were working in it would log you out, many clients use that as a way of logging out of their session, they don't walk away with the window open, do you see what I mean?
1092240691 [4351] <pam/#webco> then i don't understand, maybe I am missing something
1092242004 [4364] <pam/#webco> craigl: resource types look better but without the ccenter and org association fixed I am having a hard time checking much
1092242040 [4366] <pam/#webco> I do see that resource class says unset, should say equipment
1092242048 [4368] <pam/#webco> for eveything pretty much I think
1092242177 [4372] <pam/#webco> containing resources are not getting created
1092242189 [4375] <pam/#webco> well they are created but the association is not getting made
1092242289 [4384] <pam/#webco> where is the last inventoried date? i don't even see a field on the interface for it
1092242420 [4391] <pam/#webco> value field doesn't convert correctly.  User puts in value 3501, no decimal point, interface says 35.01, should be 3,501
1092242659 [4396] <pam/#webco> accessories did not load
1092242825 [4402] <pam/#webco> a resource got created twice
1092242865 [4406] <pam/#webco> no resource should exisit that has the same resource ID as another, that should fail
1092242896 [4413] <pam/#webco> it was in the file twice, 6 inch reflector
1092242905 [4415] <pam/#webco> but that should not get into the system that way
1092242915 [4419] <pam/#webco> it should fail and go back to the client for correction
1092242934 [4423] <pam/#webco> ok
1092242978 [4425] <pam/#webco> the resources belong to different checkout centers, they should still have unique IDs right?
1092243632 [4440] <pam/#webco> room number should link to home location I think, we don't have a field for room number, why is it in the immport?  I believe the users have used this in a home location way
1092243864 [4447] <pam/#webco> how hard would it be to add a last inventoried date to the interface and then populate with the field that exists in the import?
1092243949 [4454] <pam/#webco> maybe, there is also no field for replacement date but that exists in the import as well
1092243956 [4456] <pam/#webco> tries really hard not to run screaming
1092244014 [4463] <pam/#webco> ok, I think they should just go on the specification tab, under Other Specification
1092244018 [4467] <pam/#webco> room number is another one
1092244307 [4472] <pam/#webco> as long as those field exist in the DB and are populated with the data they provided I think those additional fields can wait until the next release
1092244323 [4476] <pam/#webco> the important issues are getting checkout centers, org, containing resources and accessories working
1092245227 [4480] <pam/#webco> all quiet now
1092245303 [4484] <pam/#webco> only if you want my chicken scratch list of media bugs
1092245884 [4497] <pam/#webco> gracchus: the noise is going to start again
1092246391 [4526] <pam/#webco> yes, as far as I know
1092246428 [4531] <pam/#webco> resource.class is all equipment within this import, not sure if at some time a client will use this to bring in locations as well
1092246599 [4537] <pam/#webco> i don't know, i didn't write the program, rtypes have always been associated to an org, what that means in the code I can't tell you
1092246625 [4540] <pam/#webco> policy checking goes on based on rtypes, ccenters and orgs, I always assumed it has to do with that
1092246806 [4544] <pam/#webco> ok, i am leaving for a little while
1092251127 [4580] <pam/#webco> ok, any others in that file?
1092251374 [4591] <pam/#webco> ok, so they are all in FTS? weird since I saw many in Photo
1092252020 [4601] <pam/#webco> duplicates in FTS file corrected
1092252033 [4603] <pam/#webco> and filed updated and resaved to my public directory
1092252070 [4611] <pam/#webco> ok
1092252125 [4615] <pam/#webco> should I be concerned that I know there are dups in Photo resource file but they did not come up in your report to me?  they did have different ccenters
1092252319 [4622] <pam/#webco> gracchus: my chicken scratch notes on media are not very readable.  I am going to open one bug for interface issues and file a list under it, ok?
1092252471 [4630] <pam/#webco> resource types are all still empty
1092252478 [4632] <pam/#webco> in the find resource type form search
1092252505 [4634] <pam/#webco> and no rtypes show up in the applet
1092252607 [4636] <pam/#webco> selecting the componants tab in the interface to see if there are accessories gets and error Servlet thread failing with: Type-error in KERNEL::OBJECT-NOT-TYPE-ERROR-HANDLER: LENS is not of type (OR NULL VECTOR CONS)<br> 
1092252616 [4640] <pam/#webco> containing resource is still not working
1092253633 [4666] <pam/#webco> craigl: photo resource file edited for dup resource IDs and resaved
1092253998 [4671] <pam/#webco> that is fine
1092259107 [4686] <pam/#webco> craigl: how are the containing resource and org issues coming?
1092260106 [4698] <pam/#webco> sure
1092260242 [4703] <pam/#webco> sent already? i dont have it
1092260449 [4707] <pam/#webco> ok, got it
1092260453 [4709] <pam/#webco> what do you want me to do with it?
1092260485 [4713] <pam/#webco> right according to the data files or right according to webco?
1092260508 [4717] <pam/#webco> ok
1092260736 [4725] <pam/#webco> right, i checked that and it is correct, checking a lot of these will be very tedious since they don't say what department they belong to
1092260766 [4729] <pam/#webco> depends on how many of these you want me to check
1092260796 [4737] <pam/#webco> pls dont spend time on running report again, just load the instance, i will work with what i have
1092261412 [4741] <pam/#webco> rename
1092261513 [4746] <pam/#webco> there are some contained pieces in file that did not appear to get contained in the list you sent me
1092261532 [4750] <pam/#webco> for example: (4D & SD) AT Short #03  contains four pieces, only three in the list
1092261556 [4752] <pam/#webco> (4D & SD) AT Short #01 and #02 both contain four pieces each and they didn't make it in the list at all, asfaict
1092261867 [4758] <pam/#webco> fook
1092261884 [4762] <pam/#webco> thanks
1092261979 [4773] <pam/#webco> craigl: app still loading? can you give me url again pls?
1092262004 [4780] <pam/#webco> jesse: thank you, and they are on the list to get update but they are delayed by a few steps, should happen the end of the month-ish
1092262239 [4782] <pam/#webco> sorry i cc'd emergency
1092262605 [4808] <pam/#webco> only the container relationships that are in the list you gave me made it into webcheckout, the ones that are not in that list did not happen 
1092262622 [4810] <pam/#webco> i got the following error when clicking on resource id Servlet thread failing with: Type-error in KERNEL::OBJECT-NOT-TYPE-ERROR-HANDLER: SILVER is not of type (OR NULL VECTOR CONS)<br> 
1092262662 [4816] <pam/#webco> ok, i was looking to see if that resource had its accessories
1092262688 [4818] <pam/#webco> not sure what to say about only some of the container relationships getting made
1092262781 [4826] <pam/#webco> there is nothing that stands out about those that did not make it to the list
1092263468 [4830] <pam/#webco> i am leaving, i will be back tomorrow afternoon
1092331514 [4971] <pam/#webco> craigl: what is going on with scad files? 600 dups??
1092333195 [4980] <pam/#webco> craigl: the corrections i did to the FTS resource file yesterday which did have some failing duplicate records are still in your list, i already fixed it once and saved back to by folder but the fixes are gone?
1092333286 [4987] <pam/#webco> that is not my question, that is ok
1092333328 [4991] <pam/#webco> when I open the fts resource file from the SCAD folder, some of the duplicate records in your email to me are already corrected but they are still coming up in the list as dups?
1092333336 [4993] <pam/#webco> for example
1092333346 [4997] <pam/#webco> Skipping duplicate resource-id "Tascam Dat A/C Power  SNDS #101" at ./csv_sql_rsrc.pl line 173, <STDIN> line 135.

1092333371 [5008] <pam/#webco> those are all unique now, different numbers at the end but they are still in your report to me,make sense?
1092333414 [5012] <pam/#webco> row 135 is #105 according to the file i opened
1092333420 [5016] <pam/#webco> oh
1092333437 [5021] <pam/#webco> right, that doesnt mean that you didnt do it this morning
1092333441 [5025] <pam/#webco> so i didnt know that
1092334050 [5030] <pam/#webco> gracchus: when you get done with your call do you think you could provide demo or someones data to the release tesing instance, i really want to go through a couple processes before I go to scad next week for training.  currently release testing instance has no data
1092336847 [5061] <pam/#webco> thank you gracchus, in so many ways
1092411618 [5175] <pam/#webco> mmmmmmm
1092411942 [5178] <pam/#webco> as far as I can tell, scad resource and patron data looks good now, just up to client to correct issues in their file
1092413027 [5186] <pam/#webco> craigl: if you can give me more information I can check it out
1092413060 [5190] <pam/#webco> when I am off the phone
1092413878 [5206] <pam/#webco> craigl: is there any subsequent work on our end for Gordon or they just need to correct data on their end?
1092417322 [5291] <pam/#webco> mine is old and weary, actually I use many OS9 Applications while I am actually running OSX, I exhaust the OS9 memory and then he likes to spank me by freezing up
1092417360 [5295] <pam/#webco> but only the OS9 applications freeze, my irc client is OS9
1092417437 [5297] <pam/#onshored> i kept reading that as "neck and the nose" and couldn't figure out why it was funny
1092417528 [5303] <pam/#webco> i hav =e X
1092417561 [5309] <pam/#webco> my life is fine
1092417646 [5315] <pam/#webco> criagl: stop it, leave me alone, do other things, i don't want to screw around with that just because twice a week I have reopen my connection to irc
1092417694 [5321] <pam/#webco> im going to grab some loonch
1092425239 [5348] <pam/#webco> craigl: i know you hate this question but: can you give me an estimate of down time for accd for their update from current version of 3.1 to 3.1.2 and split of their instance in two?
1092425310 [5365] <pam/#webco> ok, jesse, can you advise?
1092426939 [5385] <pam/#webco> craigl: question came in to support from angie (sysadmin) at ucla, when you have a moment can you pls check it out?
1092427925 [5415] <pam/#webco> sure

1092429324 [5476] <pam/#webco> i am looking into york, they are "down"
1092429393 [5478] <pam/#webco> york appears to be spinning on something, i tunneled, loaded the url and it is just hanging in my browser
1092429407 [5482] <pam/#webco> craigl: pls look? or eric does this? or what is our process
1092429689 [5496] <pam/#webco> thanks

1092432701 [5706] <pam/#webco> craigl: 9500 hangs in my browser, doesn't load application
1092433040 [5750] <pam/#webco> seems ok
1092433048 [5756] <pam/#webco> i am going in a minute
1092433289 [5772] <pam/#webco> no
1092433291 [5776] <pam/#webco> i don't know
1092670267 [5834] <pam/#webco> jesse: fyi, i was having some weird behavior with the applet on head/release while testing this weekend, i will narrow down and file bug but it should be addressed before releasing
1092678433 [5896] <pam/#webco> with a quick glance over it looks fine, we can wait for jim evans to speak up 
1092680981 [5955] <pam/#webco> criagl: woo hoo, thanks for getting that ucla bug
1092681767 [5962] <pam/#webco> that is an eric thing, he will have to advise
1092684720 [5994] <pam/#webco> craigl: i have tested the url you gave me for SCAD and it comes back as server not found.  This is what I have in my notes webcheck.scad.edu:9005/wco
1092684730 [5998] <pam/#webco> i am testing for training wed, don't tell me to tunnel :)
1092685226 [6004] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks
1092685242 [6008] <pam/#webco> no, I don't want to go there, I was testing the url I had so I could get them there during training
1092685257 [6010] <pam/#webco> I will contact the client to confirm they can access it before I leave
1092688759 [6065] <pam/#webco> http://prep.onshored.com:29678/wco
1093024789 [7110] <pam/#webco> dan and I made the call, accd upgrade is getting delayed and is not going to happen Monday morning
1093024838 [7112] <pam/#webco> as soon as cbl or jesse has a chance I would really like another test run at a migration of their data into a test instance so I can poke around and make sure that migration happens and not major show stoping bugs for them
1093024920 [7118] <pam/#webco> i am saying i want to make sure there are none, so I can't say there are any
1093024943 [7120] <pam/#webco> but imagine my trepidation about upgrading them
1093024969 [7124] <pam/#webco> also, they are a heavy MAC user and I don't know what bug jesse found about applet and OSX update
1093025010 [7129] <pam/#webco> jesse is that bug you mentioned filed?  I think I am going to update my OS so I can test it 
1093025252 [7136] <pam/#webco> Servlet thread failing with: #<Byte-Array-Output Stream> is not a character output stream.<br> 
1093025896 [7139] <pam/#webco> gracchus: any idea what verson of X i should be looking for?
1093026043 [7143] <pam/#webco> I am running 10.2.8, there is a 10.3 Jaguar but I need to purchase it
1093026054 [7145] <pam/#webco> i mean panther
1093026209 [7152] <pam/#webco> what version are you running?
1093026232 [7158] <pam/#webco> hm
1093026263 [7163] <pam/#webco> this is what the Apple site says If youre running Mac OS X versions 10.0, 10.1 or 10.2 Jaguar, all you have to do is purchase Mac OS X v10.3 Panther, pop the Panther CD in your CD or DVD drive, and run the installer.
1093026367 [7172] <pam/#webco> ah
1093026654 [7176] <pam/#webco> yes
1093036543 [7190] <pam/#webco> criagl: evergreen testing instance has been down since wed according to dave C.  I tried http://checkout.evergreen.edu:9500/wco and I get server not found error from browser
1093036780 [7200] <pam/#webco> i dont know what that means, do they have to do something on their end?
1093036899 [7215] <pam/#webco> maybe that is why the test instance was so slow for them
1093036915 [7217] <pam/#webco> the email came from dave to support, can you advise to him via email? pls?
1093037142 [7224] <pam/#webco> ok
1093296353 [7478] <pam/#webco> gracchus: the release testing link on snip snap just hangs, not up I assume, is there any way I can get an updated release testing instance to retest the bugs Ifound at scad so I can file them?
1093297036 [7492] <pam/#webco> eric: i contacted max at concordia.  I told him to expect an email in the afternoon with either a URL to their 3.1.2 testing instance or an explination of why it is not up yet and when it will be, is ok? can you put that in your PDA as a reminder?
1093447568 [8037] <pam/#webco> i would like to check out the concordia 3.1.2  instance, I hear it is up, what is the url?
1093448119 [8048] <pam/#webco> andy and craigl: i am just going to start listing out the problems I see on concordia testing instance
1093448181 [8052] <pam/#webco> 1.  Invoice data is missing, there are Invoice IDs but it you go to the invoice all data appears to be missing, no charge, no credits, no status, no patron, no checkout, no relevent dates...
1093448226 [8056] <pam/#webco> i take back the patron, there is a patron, no ck# tho
1093448973 [8074] <pam/#webco> craigl: i am currently checking out concordia, I have 2 hours of training with champlain at noon
1093448992 [8076] <pam/#webco> I can check out chapman, just not at this moment
1093449012 [8081] <pam/#webco> this is before update to 3.1.2?
1093449019 [8083] <pam/#webco> or with an update?
1093449266 [8101] <pam/#webco> criagl: set/strike being screwed up for concordia is the known issue with rpi, right?
1093449282 [8108] <pam/#webco> craigl: i will check that out now, that is their production instance right?
1093449550 [8110] <pam/#webco> criagl: as far as I can tell chapman production instance looks normal, no data issues with resources jumping out at me.  Pete will need to cross check some changes from the file they provided and make sure it looks as it should to him
1093449873 [8118] <pam/#webco> criagl: i don't know what that means in end user terms
1093449897 [8125] <pam/#webco> craigl: i am confused about the migration question, you mean getting them a test instance? after the approval of the file upload?
1093450002 [8132] <pam/#webco> oooh yeah, no can do
1093450043 [8134] <pam/#webco> do the same migration issues occur from 3.1 clients to 3.1.2 as in the rpi/concordia 3.0.5 upgrade to 3.1.2?
1093450256 [8159] <pam/#webco> craigl: i know you have several things going on but I just wanted to give you a heads up that we will need to wipe SCAD and reinstall today and then try to reload the resource files and get the last issues worked out on that, i won't be until later this afternoon tho
1093450312 [8164] <pam/#webco> at the very least the SCAD reinstall and patron reload will have to happen today
1093450513 [8184] <pam/#webco> criagl: we need to wipe the data from training, so reinstall, wipe whatever that takes is what needs to be done
1093450637 [8202] <pam/#webco> andy: other than the know issues of invoice data and set/strike problems I don't see anything out of whack for concordia, is that url the one I should give the client for their test instance?
1093450689 [8205] <pam/#webco> or our we setting up a testing instance on their server?
1093450777 [8213] <pam/#webco> andy: it will have to stay up as long as then need for testing, could be a week 
1093450787 [8215] <pam/#webco> is that still ok?
1093450818 [8227] <pam/#webco> ok, then just tell me what you decided, i am obviously not in the loop here
1093450923 [8248] <pam/#webco> ok, I am going to send that url to concordia for testing
1093451680 [8281] <pam/#webco> criagl: are you going to respond to pete at chapman or do you want me to? 
1093452448 [8293] <pam/#webco> criagl: ok, responded to pete
1093454814 [8324] <pam/#webco> artcenter is hanging on something, craigl can you check it out? rik is on the phone
1093454828 [8330] <pam/#webco> never loads and I don't get any errors
1093454968 [8338] <pam/#webco> and stuck there?
1093454991 [8340] <pam/#webco> rik asks if we can kill it?
1093455021 [8350] <pam/#webco> craigl: it still is hanging
1093455068 [8357] <pam/#webco> ok, please do
1093456049 [8371] <pam/#webco> thanks, i am training now so I need someone else on first level support until i advise i am done
1093461149 [8476] <pam/#webco> champlain has applet problems, resource types added did not show up and adding a patron gets No Patron matches error even tho they exist
1093461155 [8480] <pam/#webco> eric: you know how to fix that right?
1093461690 [8507] <pam/#webco> craigl: i have jerry from utexas calling about they reloaded their database and he is getting some results he doesn't understand or didnt expect, can you take the call?
1093461692 [8509] <pam/#webco> sounds scary
1093461775 [8515] <pam/#webco> o poop, craigl: panic message from pete when you get done with the panic phone call from jerry, i can't handle pete it is specific to something you and he discussed
1093464267 [8565] <pam/#webco> craigl: all the updated files i received from scad are in place in the folder on my public drive, when andy gets done with the install there we are clear to try again the resource load
1093464328 [8569] <pam/#webco> andy: the url I have for concordia testing site is not working now, I getNot Found
1093464328 [8571] <pam/#webco> The requested URL /wco was not found on this server.

1093470495 [8815] <pam/#webco> criagl: you have succeeded in confusing me on the circ policy stuff
1093471195 [8841] <pam/#webco> nope, I will add that to my ever growing list of things to do at 4:55pm :)
1093621347 [9978] <pam/#webco> cragil: jhu does have a configuration issue with the invoicing module.  The should have usage FINES enabaled, as shoul all client because it is part of the base system.  They should not have usage FEES enabled if they have not purchased the usage fee module.  Currently their config says NO modules enabled and the invoice icon for fine searchs is missing
1093621362 [9981] <pam/#webco> this is from the email i read from yesterday regarding jhu btw
1093622837 [10013] <pam/#webco> when a client does not have PIR yet, such as artcenter, we really should make sure to only give them the url that goes directly to webco, not the one that goes to the page that shows PIR or webco, so http://artcenter.webcheckout.net/wco/artcenter/wco
1093622871 [10023] <pam/#webco> i logged into artcenter, entered admin id and password and see no checkout centers at the login page
1093622903 [10025] <pam/#webco> criagl: can you check the admin operator status from your end? make sure it is marked as root user 
1093623170 [10031] <pam/#webco> craigl: also, rrt is not enabled and they should have that module
1093628285 [10132] <pam/#webco> here i go into scad land.....wish me luck
1093631812 [10193] <pam/#webco> criagl: i have corrected scad resource files to remove the duplicates listed in the email dan sent out yesterday, I need the resource load done again so I can check out any problems, possible?
1093635442 [10272] <pam/#webco> where?? i corrected many many, all that were in that original list, I thought
1093635457 [10275] <pam/#webco> can you email me a list?
1093635557 [10279] <pam/#webco> craigl: ok, those are my fault, i made the changes and saved the file in the wrong place, I am resaving mongomery resource file and then we can run again
1093635609 [10282] <pam/#webco> craigl: resaved, pls try again
1093637834 [10368] <pam/#webco> I agree with max on the o so annoying sound included with the bug report now.  I have complained about that before
1093638347 [10423] <pam/#webco> gracchus: media sfsu is a one time load
1093638734 [10456] <pam/#webco> craigl: did the resource load for scad take this long before? should I be worried?
1093639823 [10468] <pam/#webco> craigl: we arre back to having all empty resource types :(
1093640032 [10472] <pam/#webco> the good news is that so far the resource detail data looks good, containers are there, accessories are there, locations look good, I just need the rtypes addressed
1093640581 [10475] <pam/#webco> patrons look good
1093640615 [10495] <pam/#webco> the path is [empty] instead of Audio - blah blah - blah blah
1093640623 [10497] <pam/#webco> this happened before
1093640626 [10499] <pam/#webco> want to look?
1093640681 [10503] <pam/#webco> ok, cool
1093641593 [10549] <pam/#webco> ok
1093641711 [10551] <pam/#webco> criagl: looks much better
1093641724 [10555] <pam/#webco> now, do you want to see the problem with rtypes ending up in the wrong org hierarchy?
1093641908 [10573] <pam/#webco> come look pls, it would be easier for me to show you
1093644408 [10734] <pam/#webco> time to go
1093878597 [120] <pam/#webco> there appears to be a major problem at academyart
1093878610 [122] <pam/#webco> i can not get any resource to add to the selected resource box
1093878633 [124] <pam/#webco> if I choose one for a reservation, it stays in red and never comes back with a confirmation of the schedule
1093878639 [126] <pam/#webco> I added a patron and a date/time
1093878675 [128] <pam/#webco> i hit the commit button to move to the confirmation page and everything I requested in the applet is not there, no patron, no dates and times and the resource that stayed in red is not there
1093878681 [132] <pam/#webco> help 
1093878715 [134] <pam/#webco> status bar in the applet stays empty, no errors of no patron or resources etc
1093878838 [156] <pam/#webco> yes
1093880722 [174] <pam/#webco> gracchus: I can file
1093881358 [185] <pam/#webco> gracchus: that can't be the whole file, they are a big operation, how old is that file, maybe it was a test file?
1093881372 [187] <pam/#webco> i should call laurie at sfsu
1093881426 [195] <pam/#webco> yeah, i am sure that do
1093881435 [199] <pam/#webco> I can probably give it some attention this afternoon
1093881458 [204] <pam/#webco> craigl: email from clark at artcenter to you, appears they are still having operator settings issues?
1093881529 [206] <pam/#webco> craigl: there does appear to be a small problem still with rtypes at scad, I think it is a problem, when you have a minute I would like to show you and get your opinion
1093881895 [229] <pam/#webco> ok, let me know if you need me to check anything out
1093882114 [234] <pam/#webco> thanks
1093885513 [341] <pam/#webco> craigl: saic just called, they are not getting a response, they need a restart, can you get that for me or show andy how to please?
1093885638 [347] <pam/#webco> hello?
1093889831 [408] <pam/#webco> criagl: I am stopping my work on scad if it is all going to get deleted, pls advise if this is not the case so I can move forward and pls confirm you are making the change to resource import and running again now
1093892602 [568] <pam/#webco> as long as andy can make the change I think that is what we plan to do
1093893488 [586] <pam/#webco> chevalier: jhu usage fines has been corrected
1093893800 [598] <pam/#webco> does artcenter have new urls?
1093893874 [607] <pam/#webco> can someone give me the urls for artcenter pls?
1093893928 [630] <pam/#webco> snip snap is down, I get proxy error
1093894235 [663] <pam/#webco> craigl: usc?
1093894308 [671] <pam/#webco> artenter media warehouse is now, again, missing invoice data, balance due missing, status all says Unset
1093894315 [675] <pam/#webco> craigl: ah, i am checking it out now
1093894483 [687] <pam/#webco> craigl: yes, pls stay on scad, I am just listing the problems as I see them
1093894508 [695] <pam/#webco> me too
1093894575 [705] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did you get anywhere this morning with the applet MSIE problems? I am testing artcenter and using Netscape and I am getting the same weird behavior, artcenter uses all macs so this is a big problem for them
1093894593 [707] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i never did get to filing that bug, sorry
1093895526 [723] <pam/#webco> i see another problem at artcenter in that it doesn't appear that all the resources of a certain type are showing up in the applet.  For instance, the media warehouse has 25 Film - Grip - C-Stands that are available and circulating and yet when I open the rtype in the reservation applet I only see about 10 of them
1093895537 [725] <pam/#webco> actually, six of them 
1093895921 [750] <pam/#webco> craigl: doesn't matter, there are problems with the applet in OSX/MSIE and OSX/Netscape, I do get safari to work alright
1093895938 [755] <pam/#webco> craigl: and they are all macs there
1093896228 [757] <pam/#webco> craigl: are you calling rik?
1093896283 [763] <pam/#webco> ok, i won't then
1093896907 [786] <pam/#webco> dan: jhu invoice problem appears to be that their historical invoice data is missing information from the update to 3.1.2, I thikn craigl has a fix for this, craigl can you pls advise if the invoice missing data problem when migrating from 3.0.5 to 3.1.2 can be fixed?
1093897020 [794] <pam/#webco> ok, thanks, when you can
1093897028 [796] <pam/#webco> porkchop smoothies?
1093897054 [800] <pam/#webco> criagl: did scad resources load?
1093897070 [808] <pam/#webco> k
1093898477 [832] <pam/#webco> woot
1093898586 [842] <pam/#webco> oh, ok, ill wait
1093898785 [877] <pam/#webco> craigl: jhu does have bad invoices
1093899691 [993] <pam/#webco> craigl: checking scad now
1093899930 [1001] <pam/#webco> criagl: i think scad looks good to go, I, however, now need professional help
1093899955 [1003] <pam/#webco> dreams of her week long vegas vacation
1093900036 [1007] <pam/#webco> at least my dream will become a reality come friday
1093972687 [1452] <pam/#webco> craigl: what would be easier, forcing a unique character in front of the resource IDs of one of the checkout centers resources or changing the code?
1093974683 [1465] <pam/#webco> craigl: I don't see the SCPT org in scad at all!! yipes!! there is a file for it in the SCAD file on my computer!
1093975465 [1467] <pam/#webco> craigl: i filed a bug for the problems with IDUS/FURN resources in wrong types and assigned to you
1093976785 [1476] <pam/#webco> can it be added without disruption to other org/locations?
1093976856 [1480] <pam/#webco> thanks
1093977311 [1486] <pam/#webco> criagl: i have to go, if you can get the IDUS/FURN stuff straightened out and loaded again can you please call me on my cell so I can call aaron and have him look again, my cell is 773.744.0440
1093977357 [1494] <pam/#webco> thanks
1094051824 [1869] <pam/#webco> criagl: let me know when you have a minute to review the scad stuff
1094052490 [1887] <pam/#webco> i am sure artcenter is in already
1094053183 [1928] <pam/#webco> it should but I am not sure it is enforced.  I believe if the system hits a dup barcode it will fail a pick up or reservation I think
1094054960 [1965] <pam/#webco> criagl: i will check for faq entry
1094055020 [1969] <pam/#webco> snip snap is still down which is were I store faq info
1094056608 [1979] <pam/#webco> criagl: here is the error in SCPT location of SCAD,  I get it when I click on the FIND button from the find resource page
1094056609 [1981] <pam/#webco> Servlet thread failing with: No matching method for the generic-function #<Standard-Generic-Function ODCL:GET-PROPERTY (9) {484630D9}>, when called with arguments (NIL :DISPLAY-NAME).<br> 
1094056663 [1983] <pam/#webco> craigl: i put the test import files with two rtypes and two resources in a folder in my public director called test scad dup import files
1094056995 [1988] <pam/#webco> andy: once we get the resources straightened out at scad I will need your assistance setting up printing there, es ok? probably this afternoon sometime
1094057080 [2000] <pam/#webco> they have nothing, just now getting webco up and running
1094057094 [2002] <pam/#webco> they have many different locations all with different printing networks
1094057103 [2004] <pam/#webco> some will be networked, some just an IP, I think
1094057152 [2006] <pam/#webco> criagl has made many attempts on many occasions to try and get webco printing through my very thick head, it never sticks so I am lost when it comes to help set up printers, you will learn to love me
1094061214 [2130] <pam/#webco> craigl: both resource with the same name were ending up in one org and checkout center instead of the two different ones they were defined with
1094061315 [2136] <pam/#webco> criagl: off topic here, do you remember attempting to correct JHU report of missing invoice data after update from 3.0.5 to 3.1.2? I thought on Monday you addressed this issue, I believe it was fixed already for RPI so there is a fix out there, ring any bells?
1094061482 [2142] <pam/#webco> don't worry about the reference then, i thought rpi had the same problem when we updated them the week before which was fixed but i could be smoking crack
1094061514 [2146] <pam/#webco> i just checked JHU and their invoice data is still wacked out, do they require a restart or something to make fix take effect?
1094061782 [2150] <pam/#webco> ok, i don't want to distract you from scad or artcenter so we can address it after the fires go down a little
1094062599 [2160] <pam/#webco> i am going to tjoes for some lunch lunch be back in about 15
1094062695 [2164] <pam/#webco> sure but on Tuesday and Thursdays I get away from you all day long, today, I need to use and excuse ;)
1094066846 [2179] <pam/#webco> criagl: hows it looking at scad?
1094067653 [2195] <pam/#webco> kools1 is the pword?
1094067669 [2198] <pam/#webco> what is that number ?
1094067678 [2200] <pam/#webco> for rtorres1?
1094067704 [2204] <pam/#webco> ok, first thing I see is that I don't have a user rtorres1 as an opeartor, i have rtorres
1094067847 [2210] <pam/#webco> ok, i can log in as them just fine, calling rik
1094067849 [2216] <pam/#webco> rick
1094067855 [2220] <pam/#webco> o
1094067873 [2224] <pam/#webco> ok
1094068990 [2231] <pam/#webco> craigl: pls advise if you need me to do anything at artcenter, test? call
1094068992 [2233] <pam/#webco> ?
1094069396 [2237] <pam/#webco> criagl: did you ever even look at the scpt error problem or just go right into the resource import problem for scad?
1094074473 [2361] <pam/#webco> robby at scad left me a msg and I am afraid to call him back and tell him that another day has gone by and we have not gotten them up and ready
1094076264 [2374] <pam/#webco> biola and USFCA are both on me to get them moving forward, their imports of resources and patrons has been delayed delayed delayed
1094076288 [2376] <pam/#webco> criagl: any hope of these being attempted tomorrow if the scad data actually ever gets in the right place?
1094076309 [2380] <pam/#webco> i am beginning to think it woul have just been easier to alter the resource ID names instead of delaying this another three days
1094076327 [2386] <pam/#webco> checks to see if any local starbucks are hiring
1094076532 [2391] <pam/#webco> criagl: if the scad data doesn't come out right I am tempted to fix it through the interface, altho it will take me several hours to do at least it will be done
1094076666 [2402] <pam/#webco> i doubt that, they have small departments with a couple hundred resources, nothing compared to what we have to deal with scad
1094076696 [2406] <pam/#webco> i am not saying it is not worth fixing but I CAN NOT sit here another day and put them off any longer
1094077814 [2409] <pam/#webco> craigl: on the bright side, if hurricane frances looks like its headed their way I think they will have to evacuate starting tomorrow or friday ;)
1094077915 [2414] <pam/#webco> any one have a dollar bill they want to loan me?
1094077920 [2416] <pam/#webco> doller
1094077923 [2418] <pam/#webco> dollor
1094135205 [2439] <pam/#webco> craigl: how is the scad situation?
1094135298 [2451] <pam/#webco> criagl: i know it may be difficult to give me a more descriptive answer but I really need one, you know what position I am in here, what kind of time are we looking at?  did anything happen last night that updated the situation from what is was when you left here?
1094135317 [2454] <pam/#webco> craigl: should I start to move the many many many resource through the interface\?
1094135449 [2460] <pam/#webco> craigl: i know you said it wouldnt hurt but we still needed to address the problems because of the error that SCPT is getting in Find Resources, I can't fix that through the interface, so we left it with you to move forward
1094139569 [2472] <pam/#webco> http://prep.onshored.com:26276/wco
1094142755 [2508] <pam/#webco> craigl: pls hold on moving all those resources and let me take a look, we are talking about 5800 resources or so and that is impossible to correct through the interface
1094142775 [2510] <pam/#webco> o nevermind, i read the rest of your comments
1094142933 [2520] <pam/#webco> craigl: i am not sure, I did a search for resoruce in FURN TOOL-ROOM for example and I get the correct amount of resources that are in the file for that checkout center, there doesnt appear to be 365 orphaned when you look at the interface
1094143985 [2561] <pam/#webco> craigl: scpt resource file has, surprise surprise, 364 resources in it
1094145221 [2571] <pam/#webco> criagl: i see 365 resources in the webcheckout location under one rtype which match the 365 resources from scpt resource.csv.  there are no rtypes in scpt location which I didn't notice until just now, but you may already know that.  what does moving this 'fix' to scad production instance gain for us?
1094145575 [2581] <pam/#webco> i didn't realize there weren't any rtypes in there either
1094146607 [2585] <pam/#webco> andrei 415.274.2630
1094146712 [2587] <pam/#webco> 415.274.8630
1094146809 [2591] <pam/#webco> andy: it is bug 7531 and I assigned it to you, the file for import is on their webcheckout server and location provided by client is on the bug
1094146812 [2594] <pam/#webco> thanks
1094147312 [2598] <pam/#webco> phone andy
1094147529 [2602] <pam/#webco> ok, got it
1094147820 [2611] <pam/#webco> gracchus: sorry!
1094149134 [2628] <pam/#webco> criagl: i havnt filed a bug for umich request, it is new
1094149157 [2630] <pam/#webco> criagl: is he calling or something?
1094153640 [2642] <pam/#webco> eric: did you file bugs for aau reports yet? i can if you have not
1094156279 [2696] <pam/#webco> criagl: i get connection refused to that location
1094156390 [2701] <pam/#webco> eric: academyart bugs filed:  psoft blocker #7568, servlett thread on various actions blocker #7565, servlett thread when change resource id major #7566, prioritize at will
1094156755 [2709] <pam/#webco> criagl: the import to just scpt looks like it worked to me, i say run it to production in my op
1094157362 [2720] <pam/#webco> andy: maybe craigl can advise what script to use for a patron file import
1094158084 [2726] <pam/#webco> http://prep.onshored.com:28690/wco
1094158729 [2731] <pam/#webco> andy: i can find tha for you
1094159642 [2743] <pam/#webco> criagl: the scpt production location has no rytpes, all empty, this requires a restart?
1094161708 [2759] <pam/#webco> i am officially on vacation, don't call and don't write :)
1094835346 [4125] <pam/#webco> eric: is there some way to remove the resource import template from the website?  It is very confusing to clients, several have filled out this file without contacting me first and then I have to give them the bad news that the file is outdated and we have a new process
1094836434 [4136] <pam/#webco> criagl: i got a vague "i will take care of it" response from the guy at champlain, maybe he means he will enter through the interface now
1094838036 [4162] <pam/#webco> craigl: is there a bug number for academyart psoft problem? i am not aware of the details of the original problem so I can't check to see if it is fixed unless i get some details
1094838263 [4166] <pam/#webco> andy: the day before I left I sent an email to Larry at USFCA with you cc'd on it so you could advise them on what they needed to change in their patron file format so it would load using our csv parsor, I did not see you actually respond to this email and inform the client, did you and you just didn't cc me or support?
1094838649 [4178] <pam/#webco> andy: ok, that makes it hard for me to follow being out a couple days a week if you forget to cc so pls try to remember or you will suffer me asking you a bunch of unnecessary questions all the time, and I know you don't want that!
1094838689 [4183] <pam/#webco> andy: can you update me on the psoft problem andrei reported this morning? just missing patrons from the load? 
1094838745 [4193] <pam/#webco> can you give me some information that would make it possible to view craigls correction and actually figure out if it is fixed?
1094839076 [4200] <pam/#webco> craigl: here is what andrei sent as examples of inactive but should be active patrons:  Marvin Lee 02133340 and Ruth Delph 01022519
1094839116 [4204] <pam/#webco> I checked and Marvin Lee is not Active but Ruth Delph is still Inactive so something is maybe still not correct? can you check to see if Ruth Delph is really in their file?
1094840121 [4247] <pam/#webco> is someone going to pick up that chapman printer problem now?
1094840127 [4249] <pam/#webco> or is it going to be later?
1094840411 [4275] <pam/#webco> going for some lunch, be back in about 20 min
1094843747 [4457] <pam/#webco> craigl: i sent email to ellen and talked to her on phone
1094852046 [4595] <pam/#webco> i don't understand this, we went years without csv causing us any problems, we have always instructed our clients to provdie their data in csv format, did we change something, am I missing something?
1094852112 [4605] <pam/#webco> andy, if you can identify the column I could remove that in excel and resave as csv, would that help?
1094852131 [4611] <pam/#webco> usfca is not operational, can we update them to latest schema/
1094852141 [4613] <pam/#webco> andy: yes I do
1094852170 [4621] <pam/#webco> ok, I have no problem with that, do you want me to attempt the change to biola file?
1094852177 [4623] <pam/#webco> yes, i have biola excel files
1094852189 [4627] <pam/#webco> yes
1094852235 [4637] <pam/#webco> ok
1094852648 [4639] <pam/#webco> criagl: would it be possible for you to update whatever you need to update so I can tunnel to chapman? i get an error back from my browser and channel 2: open failed: connect failed: Connection refused
1094852669 [4641] <pam/#webco> in the tunnel window, andy said something about updating your information or something that I can't quite remember now
1094853001 [4647] <pam/#webco> craigl: still getting failed attempt
1094853220 [4666] <pam/#webco> andy: i get ssh: chapman: Name or service not known
1094853220 [4669] <pam/#webco> wco312@ftvwco:~/webcheckout/WEB-INF $ 
1094853228 [4671] <pam/#webco> must not be doing it correctly
1094854059 [4691] <pam/#webco> going home
1095090987 [4728] <pam/#webco> eric: i checked the aau test instance and it appears to up and running, who is waiting on that? do you want to contact or want me to?
1095091168 [4732] <pam/#webco> yes, it appears to be updated, I just checked it out
1095091170 [4734] <pam/#webco> i will email
1095091465 [4736] <pam/#webco> criagl: biola resource look good, I will email client to review
1095091527 [4739] <pam/#webco> craigl: the url I have for usfca doesnt seem to be working and they are not in my list of clients that I can tunnel to.  Here is what I have as url:  http://checkout.usfca.ca:9005/wco, can you verify or add them to the client list that I can tunnel when you get a chance pls?
1095098573 [4768] <pam/#webco> craigl: great, thanks, i will scratch that from my to do list
1095098602 [4770] <pam/#webco> craigl: the biola and usfca imports look good to me, I have emailed both clients.  thank you for taking care of those
1095098615 [4772] <pam/#webco> looks like ucla might be in a blocker situation
1095098643 [4774] <pam/#webco> angie emailed with some correspondence between her and andy and it looks like they were getting an error any time they tried to make a reservation
1095098661 [4776] <pam/#webco> i tried to tunnel but I can not connect, browser times out on me
1095098722 [4780] <pam/#webco> so i cant confirm or deny that they are blocked
1095098731 [4782] <pam/#webco> but i can confirm that i need lunch
1095098831 [4786] <pam/#webco> ah, better
1095098999 [4788] <pam/#webco> hm, i dont' really understand the ucla problem, i can log in and create reservation no problem, something with setting to angie's computer
1095099004 [4792] <pam/#webco> i am going to get some lunch
1095106069 [4817] <pam/#webco> i am on the phone, can someone get support
1095107009 [4821] <pam/#webco> I need to give academyart a url they can use to get to the test instance craig set up.  I know criag said something about it being on port 9009 but I don't know how to turn that into a usable url
1095107041 [4825] <pam/#webco> we used to have it at http://webcheckout.academyart.edu/test/wco but that doesnt work
1095114608 [4906] <pam/#webco> eric: fyi, i left the emails rick from artcenter sent in for you to respond/file
1095115132 [4916] <pam/#webco> craigl: who did you talk to at academyart that is supposed to be looking into their data issues with psoft?
1095431816 [6120] <pam/#webco> morning
1095432070 [6126] <pam/#webco> eric: i got a msg from Dave at Evergreen inquiring about their update and the bugs he reported, what are the feelings up updating another client?
1095435250 [6142] <pam/#webco> eric: if a bug is closed on the new snip snap page, do you want me to leave it in the list but mark it closed or delete it from the list?
1095436155 [6146] <pam/#webco> eric: if a bug is closed on the new snip snap page, do you want me to leave it in the list but mark it closed or delete it from the list?
1095453918 [6238] <pam/#webco> andy: do you need help with andreis report? it looks like a resource was choosen at time of checkout by rrt and then when the operator renewed the current checkout the system swapped out the rrt request for a different resource - that would be a yikes
1095453967 [6240] <pam/#webco> i looked at it a little before I left to the store and it does appear that is what the system did by looking at the activity tab of the order he forwarded.  I also tested a little and did not get the same behavior
1095454019 [6244] <pam/#webco> andy: where did you leave off on the many reported chapman issues? did you get anywhere?
1095454033 [6246] <pam/#webco> and by issues i mean the servlett threads pete sent in this afternoon
1095454743 [6254] <pam/#webco> i have to leave in 15 min to go to the doctor
1095455771 [6270] <pam/#webco> going now, see yall on monday
1095693408 [6355] <pam/#webco> andy: i opened up a bug for saci report of slowness, if you are on you should pick it up, it is 7612
1095694634 [6371] <pam/#webco> this came in from andrei at academyart on friday:  One of the tech was entering a large reservation for the patron Vanessa
1095694634 [6373] <pam/#webco> Grey.  He selected the c-stand type to add a c-stand to reservation and then
1095694634 [6375] <pam/#webco> every other item on the res disappeared except for the c-stand.  This is
1095694634 [6377] <pam/#webco> potentially a very large problem.  I will call the tech support line to talk
1095694636 [6379] <pam/#webco> about his in person.
1095694652 [6381] <pam/#webco> did he call and talk to someone? what was the result?
1095694705 [6389] <pam/#webco> criagl: can you advise if this was a bug or user error and if bug did you file?
1095695017 [6395] <pam/#webco> andy: did you see the request from Chris at Gordon College about changing server password for them? is that something you can/should do?
1095695052 [6397] <pam/#webco> craigl: is the patron file import fixed? can I ask andy to run champlains?
1095695751 [6412] <pam/#webco> criagl: on friday I said can we have andy run a patron import for champlain and you said, not now because it is broken, give me some time, just wondered if whatever was "broken" is fixed or if nothing was really broken do you see any reason for andy not to run a standard patron import
1095695794 [6415] <pam/#webco> andy: we need to call chris at gordon with a password, not email.
1095695896 [6426] <pam/#webco> ok, andy can you do an update to champlain and import their patron file per bug 7609? pls keep in mind that I do not know what you are working on so if you are on something more pressing than this please let me know
1095696631 [6431] <pam/#webco> does someone have ithaca cause if not i can restarty
1095696681 [6435] <pam/#webco> ok
1095697921 [6469] <pam/#webco> andy: the file I put on the bug should have both the employees and other patrons from champlain, please disregard the resource files!!! he went ahead and entered his resources by hand, I only need the patron file loaded.  The one I put on the bug becuase I merged two files he sent in to one file
1095700649 [6487] <pam/#webco> is there an up to date testing instance of the latest release? the link from snip snap doesnt seem to reslove to anything
1095700789 [6493] <pam/#webco> boris 8081
1095700996 [6511] <pam/#webco> criagl: there does appear to be something still out of whack with psoft and academyart.  there is an instance of a professor still listing as active, I have them ask greg lindsey first and he confirmed the patron should be active
1095701079 [6521] <pam/#webco> i can give you the user id, i am reopening the bug with info there
1095702053 [6540] <pam/#webco> criagl: i reopened 7571 for academyart psoft, pls take a look when you get a chance
1095702485 [6544] <pam/#webco> andy: can you give me an update on umich patron load bug #7564, last comment you made was patextract.wco is not in /tmp/patron, nor is there even a patron directory on
1095702485 [6547] <pam/#webco> gin.umdl.umich.edu.
1095702505 [6551] <pam/#webco> I don't know what that means, is it a problem on the clients end? did you contact the client?
1095702678 [6559] <pam/#webco> yes you contacted them?
1095702767 [6567] <pam/#webco> i don't remember having this, maybe you had it with eric, but this is the problem with not updating bugs or emailing support, i am wandering around in the dark crying out your name at every turn
1095702818 [6571] <pam/#webco> fancy, thanks
1095703217 [6604] <pam/#webco> i am going to the gym, be back in about an hour
1095710023 [6629] <pam/#webco> so andy is on the chapman problem of orders canceling?
1095710739 [6634] <pam/#webco> craigl: where do you want me to test?
1095711261 [6660] <pam/#webco> ok, say when
1095711761 [6668] <pam/#webco> criagl: is it ok if I see things out of whack on this instance? like instead of ck links I see  #<ALLOCATION OID 296249 (CK-7840) {49028C65}>Type: ALLOCATION 
1095711761 [6670] <pam/#webco>  7:00 PM, 9/22/2004 
1095711761 [6672] <pam/#webco>  9:50 PM, 9/22/2004 
1095711761 [6674] <pam/#webco> #<WCOF::ALLOCATION-CONTENTS {49034CD5}>Type: ALLOCATION-CONTENTS 
1095711932 [6680] <pam/#webco> ok, i am seeing other interface bugs around too
1095712069 [6684] <pam/#webco> not sure how to do that
1095712080 [6686] <pam/#webco> how would you like them marked?
1095712087 [6688] <pam/#webco> milestones i guess
1095712220 [6690] <pam/#webco> andy: champlain does not have the invoice tab on their interface, this always always always gets screwed up when we install someone
1095712247 [6692] <pam/#webco> there should be invoicing for fines but not for usage fees.  fines is a part of the base system, usage fees is a moduel
1095712249 [6696] <pam/#webco> module
1095712260 [6698] <pam/#webco> can you correct that pls?
1095712390 [6706] <pam/#webco> criagl: should I milestone the bugs I find on your instance to current release cycle? will that be enough to keep the release getting those bugs or not?
1095712945 [6723] <pam/#webco> upgrade or restart?
1095713044 [6733] <pam/#webco> when are we going to the everybody who is on current release gets little updates every night? it is very very very difficult to manage mini releases for all these people every time we fix something
1095713121 [6739] <pam/#webco> craigl: since we are probably going to have to restart chapaman (or they will) at least one more time today should we just do an update for them asap? how much time will they need to be down?
1095713155 [6743] <pam/#webco> mmm, whiskey
1095713250 [6749] <pam/#webco> im not in a panic, thanks to this job it now take a lot to get me to panic, i do however continuously want to run screaming, not really the same thing
1095714383 [6764] <pam/#webco> craigl: emailing seemed to work like a dream
1095715668 [6805] <pam/#webco> andy: make sure you are specfici about what times we are available
1095715679 [6807] <pam/#webco> you don't want to come in at 6 in the morning I would assume
1095718075 [6824] <pam/#webco> evergreen wants to update to latest 3.1.2, they are on old old version of 3.1, I would like to schedule it with Dave, how do you guys want to handle? want to test migration first? want to just give big chunck of downtime and do it without test? please advise how you would like it and Iwill call dave to schedule
1095866196 [7245] <pam/#webco> laurie sosna from sfsu has been contacting me from sfsu about their media import stuff, does any one know the status of media? of their import? 
1095866334 [7256] <pam/#webco> gracchus: how do I go about getting ssh access? is this releated to our IPs changing or something like that?
1095866348 [7258] <pam/#webco> from the move?
1095866373 [7265] <pam/#webco> ok, I should know this but I don't, what is our block?
1095867106 [7277] <pam/#webco> what does a girl have to do to get any release/head testing instances around here?
1095867243 [7288] <pam/#webco> i have asked, the links on snip snap dont work
1095868493 [7298] <pam/#webco> yes please, and possible ot make link in snip snap to go the instance too?
1095868522 [7302] <pam/#webco> thanks
1095868597 [7304] <pam/#webco> andy: can you update me on what happened with this report from chapman: received the following error:
1095868597 [7306] <pam/#webco> > Servlet thread failing with: While using database /wco312/wco312: The SQL

1095868608 [7320] <pam/#webco> last comment appears to be you saying we are looking into it
1095869688 [7344] <pam/#webco> andy: as soon as I click on Media Warehouse checkout center I get a servlett thread error
1095870093 [7359] <pam/#webco> thanks, is getting data there a big hassle?
1095871943 [7377] <pam/#webco> eric: did you talk to rik about his report of not being able to delete resources? i can reply to mail but I don't know if there was some other contact or update to this issue
1095872179 [7384] <pam/#webco> eric: i don't think so, the problem he reported is that he actually has a duplicate resource, same ID, same checkout center, neither of them contained, he says he had three of them as of yesterday but I looked and I see two of them
1095872202 [7388] <pam/#webco> he said he tried to delete one but that the delete did not take, if he did have three and now there are two it looks like it did take to me
1095872209 [7390] <pam/#webco> it was in an email
1095872248 [7394] <pam/#webco> i am going to respond to his email, ok
1095872251 [7396] <pam/#webco> ?
1095872788 [7414] <pam/#webco> well we knew it would happen, SCAD is starting to complain about the fact that their Patron Filedrop is not running, they do not have up to date patron data
1095872897 [7418] <pam/#webco> cool
1095881206 [7507] <pam/#webco> gracchus: attempting the link to release testing from snip snap I get error when I click on WebCheckout link http://liquado.onshored.com:2470/wco, it is the java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
1095883516 [7545] <pam/#webco> gracchus: is there some way to get the fee fix to scad, others, by getting it in a new release  version? there seem to be some bugs on head, obviously I suppose, so head can't be release yet, just wondering about the process
1095883539 [7549] <pam/#webco> ponders the "process"
1095883569 [7553] <pam/#webco> that would be helpful, it pretty much makes billing unusalbe as it
1095883570 [7555] <pam/#webco> is
1095883838 [7581] <pam/#webco> thank you
1095885010 [7600] <pam/#webco> andy: is scad down for some reason? I tunneled there and when I try to acces the address it just hangs in my browswer, no response
1095885113 [7606] <pam/#webco> can you access it without problem?
1095885123 [7608] <pam/#webco> the log in screen?
1095886119 [7616] <pam/#webco> andy: yes, thanks, not sure why it didn't work for me
1095888639 [7642] <pam/#webco> dan take that guy off of speaker phone!
1095890300 [7663] <pam/#webco> jesse: thanks, I will test away
1095890584 [7678] <pam/#webco> i can't test today, there is no data in testing and I dont have time to add today
1096039088 [8254] <pam/#webco> hey
1096039565 [8290] <pam/#webco> craigl: i just sent email confirmation, we'll see if it shows up
1096039721 [8298] <pam/#webco> craigl: i sent email and it never showed, you probably knew that
1096039747 [8300] <pam/#webco> do i need to continue to test other emails from rpi?
1096039809 [8304] <pam/#testing> on the admin tab of resource detail screens Status line reads like this:  Status: #<RESOURCE OID 5978001 {4BDF1E75}>Type: RESOURCE 
1096040003 [8329] <pam/#testing> the sort by arrow on the resource column of Find resource result screen is missing, makes it impossible to sort alpha by resource id
1096040035 [8331] <pam/#testing> actually I add to that, all sort by arrows seem to be missing in find resource columns result set
1096040294 [8339] <pam/#webco> cool
1096041359 [8361] <pam/#webco> sure
1096041457 [8367] <pam/#webco> andy: why could you not get to the syracuse box?  if it is the problem that we changed our IP range than we need to be more specific to the client and give them some more info on why we cant get to box and how they can get it fixed.  just saying we can't access the box if we know more info no WHY we can't access the box will only frustrate them I think
1096042609 [8408] <pam/#webco> criagl: sorry, i got pulled in a couple differnt directions at once, i will test artcetner email now
1096043056 [8437] <pam/#webco> craigl: i tried to send an email from artcenter from a confirmed checkout and got an error Servlet thread failing with: Error in function ODCL::DUMP-HTML: HTML to text conversion failed<br>
1096043147 [8455] <pam/#webco> criagl: do I need to test other emails or that is enough to go on?
1096043512 [8495] <pam/#webco> sent email from reservation at artcenter, email showed up and I did not get an error
1096043726 [8507] <pam/#webco> sent mail from invoice, checkout, reservation at artcenter and all showed up ok
1096050027 [8644] <pam/#webco> criagl: that is brand spanking new then cause we used to populate that field with "WebCheckout" as a default.  It used to be that what ever you typed in there was what the receipient of the email would see as the from field in their email, now that HAS to be an email address?  or am I understanding this wrong?
1096050084 [8647] <pam/#webco> that is not a training issue, that is a "hey, we changed our software again just to keep you on your toes" issue
1096050321 [8658] <pam/#webco> well, it has never been a problem before right now as far as I know and folks have been changing that field for as long as I have been doing this so.....?  
1096050346 [8661] <pam/#webco> it doesn't matter, if you say it has to be that way now, then fine, you will get a big ok, whatever from me :)
1096057607 [8744] <pam/#testing> something is wrong with the resource search functions.  I typed in resource type "orphans" and even tho there are 21 resources in that type I got no search results
1096057706 [8748] <pam/#testing> also, If I do a search for a resource within that type I don't get a result either, I tried "2 Grip Clip # 025" and got nothing even tho I copied the resource ID from another page so I know it exists
1096057814 [8755] <pam/#testing> the status of when a resource is coming back is wrong.  On the find resource results, if  a resource has a future reservation, it should read Available until "date" with the CK#, Ill check a different version to see if I can find the exact correct text
1096057822 [8757] <pam/#testing> goldroom
1096057849 [8766] <pam/#testing> ooooo, the checkout center is flipping around on me
1096057886 [8770] <pam/#testing> ok, that make the bug different.  The first time I load the find resources it defaults to webcheckout center, after I perform one search the next time it is gold room
1096057937 [8776] <pam/#testing> indeed, if I hit the reset query option it reverts to WebCheckout as the location, after one search page refreshes and now it says goldroom
1096058642 [8787] <pam/#testing> so resource should have this text under them in the find resource result set "Available until 2:00 PM, 9/25/2004, CK-47797" when they have a reservation
1096058673 [8790] <pam/#testing> and this when they are checked out  "Checked out in CK-47794" and the ck's should be links to the order
1096059255 [8799] <pam/#testing> the drop down on Find Resource for Resource Class only have the option None in it, there should be one for Equipment and Location as well
1096059415 [8801] <pam/#testing> I created a new resource type, changed name, clicked on create sub type of  this type and got the following error Servlet thread failing with: Error in KERNEL::UNBOUND-SYMBOL-ERROR-HANDLER: the variable WCO::SELF is unbound.<br>
1096060201 [8809] <pam/#testing> bug 7626 on containers is valid on the head, still broker
1096298041 [8893] <pam/#testing> more testing today?
1096298071 [8895] <pam/#webco> andy: is the problem with evergreen operators not migrating something you can fix or do we need craigl for it?
1096299307 [8903] <pam/#webco> ok, did the migration happne then?
1096299354 [8909] <pam/#webco> i don't understand what waiting for fix_contraints.sql to apply means, how long will that take?
1096299481 [8921] <pam/#webco> o, ok, so you apply that to someone like evergreen and when that is complete you can move forward with the migration?
1096299913 [8941] <pam/#webco> ah, ok, thank you for the explanation
1096301516 [8948] <pam/#webco> chevalier: can you clarify if the patron file load for ubc is to go to ubc or ubc-faced or both?
1096302317 [8954] <pam/#webco> thanks

1096304129 [9008] <pam/#webco> ubcfaced has sent in a new patron file for us to load and update their patrons, they are running 3.0.4.1, is running the new patron load dependant on updating them to current release?
1096306339 [9022] <pam/#webco> criagl: I get the csv instructions, thanks.  can you advise on my question about ubcfaced patron import above?
1096307867 [9033] <pam/#webco> andy: did you figure out why I could not get to my tunnel for evergreen?
1096307875 [9035] <pam/#webco> i really need to check out that info fromdave
1096307882 [9037] <pam/#webco> can you help?
1096308800 [9051] <pam/#testing> on resource detail specification tab, contains line reads like this: Contains     (#<RESOURCE OID 5978173 {4B21CD9D}>)Type: CONS
1096309047 [9053] <pam/#testing> I set a usage fee to Subtype of Sub II Testing Types for $10/hour, made a reservation for the one resource that belongs to that type, no est fee showed up on the contents tab
1096309206 [9055] <pam/#testing> picking up and returning the allocation did not create an invoice either
1096309516 [9057] <pam/#testing> loading resource types seems to hold up the applet for a long time when there are a lot of resources under the type, I selected Hard Drive, Firewire and it took 120+ sec to load the resources there, is this because of boris or is there a problem?
1096309713 [9061] <pam/#testing> ok
1096310114 [9065] <pam/#webco> yes
1096310154 [9069] <pam/#webco> very sorry, didn't realize he sent to emergency
1096310167 [9071] <pam/#webco> with his o so not an emergency problem
1096310226 [9079] <pam/#webco> just so you know by email header only ever says support, it never says emergency support so in order for me to know if someone sent to support I have to read all the header garbage of the email, which I never do, so sorry
1096310281 [9084] <pam/#webco> phew
1096310387 [9086] <pam/#webco> criagl: can you please, with sugar on top, answer my quetion from about regarding ubc patron file load?
1096310444 [9092] <pam/#webco> thai fried rice it weird but yummy
1096310455 [9094] <pam/#webco> craigl: coolio, thanks
1096313074 [9187] <pam/#testing> on checkout center detail screen, general tab, there is no edit button next to the billing contact info fields:  Billing contact     None

1096313470 [9224] <pam/#testing> adding a repeat rule for every monday for October got the following error:Servlet thread failing with: Error in function IMHO:CHILD-ELEMENT: multiple subelements with name "repeat-until-date" in #<WCO::RESERVATION-SCHEDULING-ABSTIME return-time><br>
1096313667 [9231] <pam/#testing> fyi, i was in the process of creating a reservation and adding repeats to it
1096313820 [9247] <pam/#testing> boris seems to not be responding now
1096314175 [9255] <pam/#webco> craigl: adding/removing holds seems to be working well on prep
1096314220 [9259] <pam/#webco> i am going to run an errand, be back 1/2 hour or so
1096318266 [9368] <pam/#testing> i can't get reports to load, I go to Find Reports and the page loads, if I click on set/strike report it seems to just hang, never loads the report, i tried overdue invoices too and got the same behavior
1096320141 [9401] <pam/#webco> criagl: the hold stuff looks pretty good, I did notice that the "Patron has outsanding Fine" override is not being triggered at all, not sure it that is new or a problem with the release already
1096320275 [9405] <pam/#webco> ok, i can check, hold on
1096320491 [9453] <pam/#webco> criagl: ok, that override is not being triggered currently at chapman so you are right, not related, I have not found any problems with holds now
1096322261 [9474] <pam/#webco> me and my runny nose are out of here
1096474021 [9897] <pam/#webco> andy: please restart release testing instance on liquado 2470
1096474326 [9901] <pam/#webco> criagl: does are patron import care if the last name field is left blank? biola wants to put the entire name into the first name field, that is ok isn't it?
1096475688 [9920] <pam/#webco> criagl: the container problem does go away after restart
1096485238 [10034] <pam/#webco> is there some reason why my home directory on prep is no longer reachable? it just seems to hang when I request it
1096485888 [10058] <pam/#webco> craigl: maybe when you have a minute you could come look, it is probably something I am doing
1096493724 [10105] <pam/#testing> there is still something wrong with the applet and speed, I requested the View Available window for 1K baby stands, only has six or seven resources in it, it took 90+ seconds to load the schedule
1096493947 [10107] <pam/#testing> if I exhaust a resource type during a reservation i get the red unavailable warning as expected.  If I double click the unavailable line to remove it, it appears that the unavailable moves up one and an available one is removed, if I wait about 20 seconds the page refreshes and the available one comes back and the red unavail goes away, however that is too confusing for the end user, they will not wait that long, bad user feedback
1096494060 [10109] <pam/#testing> repeat on specific date gets error too, like repeat on range of dates  Servlet thread failing with: Error in function IMHO:CHILD-ELEMENT: multiple subelements with name "repeat-on-date" in #<WCO::RESERVATION-SCHEDULING-ABSTIME return-time><br>
1096494147 [10113] <pam/#testing> who is that
1096494154 [10119] <pam/#webco> who is that?
1096494163 [10127] <pam/#webco> why do they want me
1096494180 [10129] <pam/#webco> voicemail
1096494347 [10132] <pam/#testing> there is a resource on overdue allocation CK8401 that has the text RESERVATION - CANCELLED in the return column, that is very strange, not sure how that text got there, the state is actually current checkout and there are several items checked out and some already returned on this order, weird
1096904572 [259] <pam/#webco> chapman is getting false neg response when using rrt with types where there are many many resources of the same type, reopened 7157
1096905464 [277] <pam/#webco> criagl: this came in from pete at chapman:  We are trying to create new resource types for some new equipment.  We click on "create new resource type" and then try to enter it.  Then, when we go to the list of resource types, the new one that we created is not there.
1096905475 [279] <pam/#webco> doesn't that sound like another cache problem?
1096906934 [296] <pam/#webco> ronda from scad just called to let us all know that she LOVES webcheckout and that she really appreciates all of our hard work and assistance, she couldn't be happier
1096906942 [299] <pam/#webco> isn't that a sign of the apocalypse?
1096911086 [351] <pam/#webco> in mail from andrei to support on friday I see We are running into a problem printing contracts.  A tech was trying to
1096911086 [353] <pam/#webco> print CK-7838 for Damian Lucas, but instead the system prints CK-8478.
1096911087 [357] <pam/#webco> Andrei
1096911099 [359] <pam/#webco> was this ignored or responded to outside of support list?
1096911342 [362] <pam/#webco> there is also an email from Larry on Friday where it appears he is having cache setting problems, no response was made via support, did someone talk to him outside of support?
1096912850 [369] <pam/#webco> criagl: do you know if the container "fix" is something that can be moved to release for testing/release? 
1096915130 [385] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i havn't tested in a few days but a big one I came across was repeating reservations not working, and I actually havn't had enough time with circulation testing for my taste
1096915230 [387] <pam/#webco> haven't havn't hvnt
1096915399 [391] <pam/#webco> sorry, I know I have been told this before, but I need to get into saic to test a bug that was reported, how do I access? can someone just give me an address to access?
1096915646 [398] <pam/#webco> o, that works, nice
1096921346 [480] <pam/#webco> where is best place for head testing now?
1096921427 [487] <pam/#webco> started #testing, pls join if testing/fixing
1096921430 [489] <pam/#webco> great!
1096921588 [498] <pam/#webco> ok
1096923168 [509] <pam/#testing> ok, I should file instead of using irc?
1096923250 [515] <pam/#testing> the loading of rrt requests does seem slow, even using a typw with fewer resources in it, 3 requests still took a good 45 sec to load
1096924212 [518] <pam/#testing> hm, view avail doesn't appear to be loading schedules
1096926940 [534] <pam/#testing> is head rebuilding?
1097078265 [685] <pam/#testing> i need to test a reported printing problem, what do I need to add as the print queue in order to test this?
1097080006 [695] <pam/#testing> late checkout return times are not showing up in red
1097083746 [702] <pam/#testing> ran into a blocking bug using rrt, filed 7644
1097084425 [707] <pam/#testing> is the chapman data being used on liquado really old?
1097084437 [710] <pam/#testing> there are a lot of discrepencies compared to their production data
1097087499 [720] <pam/#testing> hello?
1097089065 [722] <pam/#webco> andy that did not show up on your index page, am i looking in the wrong place
1097091108 [728] <pam/#webco> craigl: no, not yet
1097091115 [730] <pam/#webco> and I have tried
1097091178 [734] <pam/#webco> I do get bad user feedback, imho
1097091224 [736] <pam/#webco> if you get to the unavailable point and then you try to remove the unavailable request they system flashes with one of the matched request gone and the unavailable still there
1097091238 [740] <pam/#webco> give it a couple seconds and it will flash again with the unavailable gone and the match back
1097091260 [743] <pam/#webco> but in that time the user could try to remove the unavaile warning one again, thereby removing two instead of one
1097096240 [772] <pam/#webco> is the multiple match patron box supposed to be off of a search for only last names?
1097097126 [835] <pam/#webco> andy: i never checked ucb upgrade data
1097097161 [839] <pam/#webco> also, I don't ever remeber evergreen upgrade test completing, did it? do you remember how long it took so I can schedule with dave?
1097097172 [843] <pam/#webco> andy: is ucb data still up? can you advise url?
1097099794 [861] <pam/#webco> andy: pls advise if/when you want me to look at evergreen data
1097249824 [1286] <pam/#webco> did someone talk to andrei about his report of the system logging a user out during a reservation?  he sent email to support at 2pm yesterday, I see no response, anyone?
1097253249 [1315] <pam/#webco> criagl: pls advise when you can update the head test, also I would like to get fresh chapman data if possible
1097260366 [1462] <pam/#webco> i am going to seek some lunch
1097263279 [1548] <pam/#webco> this is what I get when I try to access PIR on Head, is this a bug or a jetty problem?

1097507548 [1693] <pam/#webco> email came in from University of Cairo, obviously I can give the guy our support login information but is there some specifics anyone wants to give in reference to him configuring the server?
1097507596 [1697] <pam/#webco> eric: did you see the email from jeff pearson in regards to server upgrade at umich (friday email)?
1097507604 [1701] <pam/#webco> do you know how we should proceed with that?
1097507911 [1714] <pam/#webco> craigl: I would prefer you write the email, other than coping and pasting your comments here I  can't make it make sense, since I dont understand anything about it, I am first level support and the sooner everyone stops trying to make me do higher level support stuff the better, it truly just frustrates me because I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT AND DONT WANT TO :) andy can write it, it doesn't have to be you
1097507964 [1720] <pam/#webco> eric: right, how do you wnat to manage that?
1097508019 [1727] <pam/#webco> andy: that is great for umich issue, craigl and I are talking about u of cairo which could use  an email about initial server configuration
1097508029 [1731] <pam/#webco> thanks
1097508110 [1735] <pam/#webco> criagl: what do you think about removing the "asset-tag" column from the resource import? unless you can tell me what it is for cause I don't know what it corespondes to on the interface, if anything
1097508211 [1745] <pam/#webco> just a mystery field? how nice
1097508471 [1755] <pam/#webco> yes, but telling him that will immediately get the "when will we get 3.1.2 upgrade" question, how long should we tell him
1097512526 [1787] <pam/#webco> criagl: confused by you closing bug 7658 servlett error on set/strike as duplicate of 7543 deleted patrons in multiple match found, mistake?
1097514101 [1799] <pam/#webco> applet on the head is missing subtype box and selected resource box
1097514159 [1802] <pam/#webco> hm, missing formatting it seems, data will show up but the lines are gone
1097522776 [1824] <pam/#webco> eric: got list down to 9 bugs, there is one questionable one left, it is in regards to view by home location, it is broken in both release and head but in different ways but only affects ucla so as long as we don't release to ucla until view by home location is fixed we can move that one off as well, what do you think?
1097523080 [1835] <pam/#webco> ok, bugs to 8 then
1097680982 [2122] <pam/#webco> jesse: scroll bars are back on applet but they flash a lot while loading
1097681014 [2126] <pam/#webco> o, i saw the bug 
1097681276 [2129] <pam/#webco> jesse: I still see 3 open blockers on the head in bugzilla: 7645, 7655 and 7667
1097682003 [2138] <pam/#webco> craigl: ill take a look, I didnt file that one so ill get back to you
1097682630 [2143] <pam/#webco> craigl: sarah bug is valid.  The should be an override called "Patron has outstanding Fine
1097682640 [2147] <pam/#webco> which is different from Patron is on Hold
1097682702 [2153] <pam/#webco> but blocker, not so sure about that
1097685033 [2175] <pam/#webco> 221-37100-01 & 02
1097686524 [2185] <pam/#webco> andy: yes, if you view the Hours tab on the Adminstrator tab and click the View weekly schedules tab and compare it to the same on kfreedom
1097687490 [2204] <pam/#webco> andy: did you reply to ellen and let her know we are testing the migration for them right now?  also, I assume we have access/pw to their new server and all that good stuff, yes?
1097687586 [2209] <pam/#webco> ooo, view avail on the head is sooo much better, happy happy
1097687926 [2213] <pam/#webco> new bug on the head, poop
1097688040 [2215] <pam/#webco> hopefully not to hard to fix, filed 7670
1097689428 [2220] <pam/#webco> ah yes
1097689668 [2225] <pam/#webco> wait did you just do it, did we file same bug then? i filed 7672
1097689701 [2228] <pam/#webco> yep, i close mine
1097689809 [2230] <pam/#webco> going to git some grub
1097691329 [2250] <pam/#webco> head is down again
1097692143 [2256] <pam/#webco> i think it so
1097692248 [2258] <pam/#webco> damn, i hate reports like this  CK-9727 for student Ashley Hudson was returned yesterday at approx. 11:00am.
1097692248 [2262] <pam/#webco> The technician who checked her in is sure that he returned her in the
1097692249 [2264] <pam/#webco> computer, but today that CK was shown as unreturned.
1097692256 [2266] <pam/#webco> how the heck am i supposed to test for that?
1097692738 [2273] <pam/#webco> my mom will be so proud
1097692881 [2284] <pam/#webco> hehe
1097693154 [2291] <pam/#webco> ayayayayayayayay
1097696254 [2342] <pam/#webco> criagl: 7667 is a big ol works for me afaict
1097697593 [2359] <pam/#webco> jesse: i am having some trouble with the applet still, do you want to look at it? maybe is just a firefox issue
1097698348 [2364] <pam/#webco> all of a sudden I am getting servlett thread logging into head

1097698989 [2377] <pam/#webco> applet looks good except for the disappearing requests that add back if you wait for it, I know that will take a lot to fix per you note on the bug, just worries me is all
1097700791 [2397] <pam/#webco> criagl: that is not was bug 7371 is saying.  sarah is saying that the system is not prompting operators for a pin number when the action was granted via a role instead of a one by assigning of capabilities.  I will test on head and see if that is the case
1097701013 [2405] <pam/#webco> doh, new bug filed for granting capabilitgy
1097701293 [2408] <pam/#webco> criagl: i was deleting a resource on head and got the following error, is this the error caused by referencing a building pass with this item or should I file this

1097702459 [2465] <pam/#webco> criagl: does that mean I don't need a bug on that?
1097854100 [2866] <pam/#webco> criagl: there is an old yet still existing problem for one psoft patron at academyart, you were looking into it but there was no follow up.  I am forwarding your last email on the issue to support now for you to review, user David Westby 00864061 is still not coming in active 
1097854115 [2868] <pam/#webco> and andrei has complained recently about it becoming a larger problem
1097854181 [2874] <pam/#webco> craigl: you can update me then cause the last email sent said you would follow up and I don't see it
1097854198 [2878] <pam/#webco> and David Westby is still inactive and according to them should be active
1097854257 [2890] <pam/#webco> look man, these are your words:  I'm researching it, and will let you know when I've found the source of the problem.
1097854258 [2895] <pam/#webco> I'm quite sure it is not your problem at this point.
1097854267 [2897] <pam/#webco> ok, pls advise when you can update
1097854902 [2907] <pam/#webco> is it possible to forwad the rest of the correspondence to support?
1097857354 [2921] <pam/#webco> any one know how to set the cache memory settings in safari? all i see is a clear cache, no ability to set always?
1097858447 [2926] <pam/#webco> working on it now
1097858601 [2928] <pam/#webco> craigl: don't you use safari on your mac?
1097859386 [2939] <pam/#webco> eric: did you talk to pete from chapman yesterday or did his email go un-responded to?
1097874129 [2999] <pam/#webco> criagl: fees/fines do seem wacked now
1097874257 [3009] <pam/#webco> i havn't seen any errors yet that did not correspond to a set policy, are there any specific ones you are curious about?  i just started testing so if you can give me some direction
1097875072 [3018] <pam/#webco> havnt seen that yet, can you file it?
1097875079 [3020] <pam/#webco> i filed a bug on fees/fines 
1097877776 [3035] <pam/#webco> yes
1097877781 [3039] <pam/#webco> yes
1097877784 [3043] <pam/#webco> right
1097877801 [3045] <pam/#webco> well, the flat fine would not be assessed until the grace period had expired
1097878217 [3051] <pam/#webco> hm
1098116441 [3113] <pam/#webco> uiuc is getting some very strange behavior, on 3.0.5, need to schedule update asap I think, how is your time looking andy?
1098117792 [3120] <pam/#webco> i'll send that along to the client then
1098117820 [3124] <pam/#webco> yes please
1098121009 [3129] <pam/#webco> andy: uiuc is going to need to be updated, I told them we would test their migration sometime this week and asked them for a scheduled time next week that they could be down four hours during 9-5 
1098123310 [3141] <pam/#webco> criagl: will it give multiple match found resonse if it gets more than one partail?
1098128337 [3187] <pam/#webco> I can't tunnel to chapman
1098130909 [3192] <pam/#webco> i need to run an errand, be back soon
1098137240 [3429] <pam/#webco> me too
1098137274 [3433] <pam/#webco> ooooo yes i do
1098286422 [3717] <pam/#webco> andy: uiuc has two departments using 3.0.5, they have experienced some blocking problems this week that pushes them towards the top of the update list.  They can be down for the afternoon next Tuesday for an update to both their instances, will this work with your current work schedule? time to test their migration this week before we do it for them on Tuesday?
1098286773 [3723] <pam/#webco> is csustan scheduled already? are they having blocking/critical problems?
1098288959 [3734] <pam/#webco> eric: I would say that csustan report of items disappearing from allocations is blocking, I vote for csu first then uiuc (hopefully can be done for tuesday!)
1098300831 [3765] <pam/#webco> andy called him after he sent that email
1098300864 [3769] <pam/#webco> does any one have any clues about the recurring error reported by both academyart and chapman that happens occasionally upon commit?  Servlet thread failing with: Error in function WCOF::RUN-RTYPE-SCHEDULER:  No resources supplied to type scheduler.<br> 
1098300881 [3772] <pam/#webco> hard to reproduce since there doesn't appear to be a specific recepie
1098300884 [3776] <pam/#webco> recipe
1098300895 [3778] <pam/#webco> rysippie
1098302002 [3788] <pam/#webco> i am testing on the head
1098302014 [3790] <pam/#webco> expired allocations that is
1098306029 [3796] <pam/#webco> No, you're welcome
1098459707 [4042] <pam/#webco> criagl: that is true, sarah is asking for an enhancement, downgrade that puppy to enhancement
1098460506 [4058] <pam/#webco> overdue causes the fine to go to $80 rather than $70.  As for the usage fee,
1098460506 [4059] <pam/#webco> *if* there is a late fine for the same resource, the usage fee is computed  only
1098460506 [4061] <pam/#webco> as the difference between the scheduled pickup and return times, and the late
1098460506 [4063] <pam/#webco> fine over the difference between the scheduled and actual return times.
1098460512 [4065] <pam/#webco> sorry
1098460903 [4070] <pam/#webco> sorry, my bad keystroke made that happen
1098460911 [4076] <pam/#webco> no, I don't think so
1098718050 [4404] <pam/#webco> craigl: is that a training issue, meaning you don't know where to find locations or how to view by location in the applet?
1098718573 [4415] <pam/#webco> criagl: the bug is a little different than when I logged it but still valid
1098718599 [4417] <pam/#webco> If I add a Location  it will appear in the applet when I say Select by location
1098718614 [4422] <pam/#webco> but there is no way to make the locations I create a home location
1098718644 [4424] <pam/#webco> the only items that appear in the Find Location search form are checkout centers, not physical and deliver to locations, which is what should appear there
1098718664 [4426] <pam/#webco> does this make sense to you:?
1098718685 [4430] <pam/#webco> o good
1098718692 [4432] <pam/#webco> do you want do come here and we can talk about it?
1098724691 [4447] <pam/#webco> andy:  OP-CamKit-065
1098724903 [4449] <pam/#webco> andy: the Activity tab on all allocations at migrated UIUC instance is blank, did not migrate
1098725516 [4456] <pam/#webco> andy: lots of invoice data is missing: debits/credit info, status is unset, billing type is wrong (ie should be non-recharge but says cash), billing tab is missing billing contact info, dates missing
1098730824 [4470] <pam/#webco> phone ellen
1098731337 [4473] <pam/#webco> can i get the release version updated for testing with ithaca data, they have many problems that I need to test and file
1098733550 [4477] <pam/#webco> craigl: please let me know when/where you are able to get the release test instance of ithaca data for me, thanks
1098736330 [4521] <pam/#webco> criagl: can you turn off rrt for my testing ithaca pls, they do not have rrt and it would make it easier to recreate some problems they reported
1098738253 [4550] <pam/#webco> i tried to log into concordia but the admin pword I have doesn't seem to work, can either andy or craigl look up what they have for me please?
1098738871 [4552] <pam/#webco> andy: we need to try to restore the allocation history to ithaca that were lost upgrade, I am opening a bug and adding it to the list of to dos for you, o joy joy joy
1098739346 [4559] <pam/#webco> ok, thank you
1098740806 [4563] <pam/#webco> andy: be able to what?
1098741045 [4567] <pam/#webco> that would be great
1098741577 [4570] <pam/#webco> concordia has an allocation in the checkout state that they need to return that gets the following error when you click on the ck:
1098741577 [4572] <pam/#webco> #<WCO::WEBCHECKOUT {480F2A5D}>: An error occurred during processing:
1098741577 [4574] <pam/#webco> NIL fell through ETYPECASE expression.
1098741578 [4576] <pam/#webco> Wanted one of (WCOF:RESOURCE-TYPE WCOF:RESOURCE). 
1098741587 [4578] <pam/#webco> any suggestions on what I should tell max?
1098742239 [4582] <pam/#webco> I checked the one resource on the order and it appears to be fine
1098890652 [5060] <pam/#webco> eric: you emailed chris dutton at ucla that you could add him to the list for update but the truth is that view by home location (thier paid enhancement to the system) is totally hosed right now
1098891845 [5071] <pam/#webco> eric: ok, and yes there is a bug on that
1098891914 [5073] <pam/#webco> jesse: is there a reason you are removing client names from bugs, I find it helpful when I deal with clients to be able to search for their previous bugs, that is why I add the client name in the summary field, i guess i could start putting it in the description field if it is a problem
1098894071 [5123] <pam/#webco> jesse: ellen has reported a problem with the status bar in the applet, it seems to "update" several times in a row when you make any change to an allocation.  for instance, I altered the due back time for a reservation for one item, I watched the Update allocation status flash back and forth five times before it stopped and listed all the warnings/errors, what is to be expected here? is this a bug?  it is annoying and confusing but I am not sure if it is a bug
1098896852 [5187] <pam/#webco> jesse: i only got 7712 to happen one time after many many many attempts to make it happen, ellen claims she is getting it all the time, i can try to make it happen again
1098896872 [5189] <pam/#webco> o, nevermind, i read the rest of your comments
1098897667 [5205] <pam/#webco> lunch
1098904584 [5218] <pam/#webco> eric: chris dutton has asked for a timeline for repairing the location problems in webco, what  is a realistic est to give him? do you want to review current to dos with me or do you have some idea already?
1098904798 [5229] <pam/#webco> eric: I will need to go back and review specifics but there were bugs that were keeping him from using webco, I will try to have details by end of the day so we can make an informed decision
1098907294 [5254] <pam/#webco> i tried to tunnel ucal and this is what I got: HTTP ERROR: 404 /ucla/wco Not Found 
1098907295 [5256] <pam/#webco> RequestURI=/ucla/wco 
1098907299 [5258] <pam/#webco> do i need to restart them?
1098907863 [5265] <pam/#webco> hello?
1098908715 [5298] <pam/#webco> email came in from usc that they were having trouble printing one agreement form, I don't know what to do with that, any ideas?
1098909271 [5344] <pam/#webco> I think there is still a bug cause I think there was something about scheduling past the advance limit caused a no duration or something, I need to do more testing
1098909325 [5346] <pam/#webco> i have too many tests, bugs, client demands flying around in my head i can't keep them straight any more
1098909367 [5350] <pam/#webco> i am working on trying to figure out how to make 7712 and I will move to 7363 after that
1098913024 [5395] <pam/#webco> jesse: testing for 7363, I think maybe the problem is related to the same things we watched happen on my screen.  If I choose dates beyond the reservation advance limit and add a resource the updating msg flashes several times and then when it settles it says there is no duration, even tho there is
1098913098 [5401] <pam/#webco> the timeline does give some weird feedback too cause it will load the schedule of the requested resources for the next "x" number days (advance limit) and then place the green/purple bars somewhere in the middle so you are looking at a schedule that is really not what dates you requested, make sense?
1098913121 [5406] <pam/#webco> not sure how that would be clarified...maybe have the bars always move to the end of the schedulator
1098913214 [5419] <pam/#webco> yeah, that could get pretty long and i would assume and eat up some loading time maybe?
1098913260 [5423] <pam/#webco> hmm
1098913290 [5427] <pam/#webco> another thing i noticed is the reservation advance limit override did not come up, I shall bug that in another bug or do you want to handle all together?
1098913516 [5433] <pam/#webco> yes, i put in 12/27/04 as start date and the advance limit is 28 days, it should have given me an override, yes?
1098914079 [5441] <pam/#webco> chevalier: it appears that the operator walked away while makeing these suspect orders, we can confirm the orders were ever committed and neither can they
1098914091 [5443] <pam/#webco> i mean we can't confirm
1098914125 [5446] <pam/#webco> this is the email from jun:
1098914125 [5448] <pam/#webco> Thanks for your response.
1098914125 [5450] <pam/#webco> I had been trying the whole morning to retrieve CK#s but not
1098914125 [5454] <pam/#webco> successful.  So I do not know what to do at this point
1098914126 [5459] <pam/#webco> to help find out what happened.  All I remember is that I was editing a
1098914126 [5461] <pam/#webco> couple of major reservations, got interrupted and left my computer for
1098914128 [5465] <pam/#webco> about an hourin both cases.  I am guessing maybe Monday PM or Tuesday
1098914130 [5467] <pam/#webco> AM.  FYI.
1098915274 [5498] <pam/#webco> fire him?? harsh
1099063577 [5716] <pam/#webco> jesse: looks like you got a lot of good work done on the bugs yesterday, how about an update to the head with some fresh ithaca data for me and I will take another swing at things?
1099064177 [5723] <pam/#webco> no problem, thanks
1099064428 [5733] <pam/#webco> craigl: whoever then
1099064438 [5737] <pam/#webco> hts
1099064440 [5739] <pam/#webco> thx
1099065055 [5748] <pam/#webco> jesse: the applet timeline/status msg still seem buggy.  I am getting allocation has no duration when I do have the times set and I just got it to suggest a resource to me that has a conflict
1099065069 [5750] <pam/#webco> probably related
1099065096 [5754] <pam/#webco> if it doesnt think the allocation has a duration then it would make sense that it just gives me what ever resource regardless of conflicts
1099065496 [5771] <pam/#webco> jesse: i have been trying, eric helping now too, i cant figure out a recipe, sometimes it happens sometimes ti does not, we will see if we can narrow this down for you
1099072125 [5817] <pam/#webco> if that is new then do nothing I would say, the bigger issue was def. the jumping start time
1099072563 [5826] <pam/#webco> great
1099073863 [5846] <pam/#webco> jesse: did you take the liquado head down?
1099073971 [5848] <pam/#webco> i need to get some lunch
1099080025 [5905] <pam/#webco> jesse: i don't think exp dates on groups/classes is correct, maybe it is me
1099080046 [5907] <pam/#webco> if I edit the group expiration it alters all the individual and type exp to the date I set for the group
1099080061 [5910] <pam/#webco> that's not right is it?
1099080393 [5920] <pam/#webco> you are correct, yay
1099081107 [5925] <pam/#webco> ooo do I want to get my hands on a test instance with view by home location fixed
1099081482 [5927] <pam/#webco> I just found a small but confusing problem.  It looks like the word Intervening has been replaced with the work Conflicting when there are orders ahead of an allocation you are viewing, that is very confusing UI, I am going to file that now
1099081653 [5929] <pam/#webco> filed 7730
1099082276 [5935] <pam/#webco> jesse: all bug fixes confirmed except for 7727, will wait for you to advise when head is updated with that fix and I will test that
1099082822 [5939] <pam/#onshored> creepy
1099082826 [5941] <pam/#onshored> adam in drag?
1099082858 [5950] <pam/#webco> ok, i just added one I found for the find checkouts page not having the correct default settings
1099082885 [5954] <pam/#webco> back to being loud? was it ever fixed?
1099086367 [5974] <pam/#webco> andy: from what I could see on evergreen, no migrationissues stood out but I do need to see it with invoices and schedules corrected
1099266199 [5979] <pam/#webco> \
1099333210 [6133] <pam/#webco> the head testing instance has no data, can someone add Ithaca data back to it form me when possible, please?
1099343178 [6329] <pam/#webco> andy: i noticed this on the Processes tab of Evergreen production instance "Run NowEvergreen overdue checkout report2 hours after midnight4:03 AM, 11/1/20042:00 AM, 11/2/2004" but it does not exist on migrated instance, I don't even know what this report is, some custom report?
1099343294 [6334] <pam/#webco> ooooh
1099499658 [6686] <pam/#webco> eric: we need to schedule the RPI arts department install (they do want a new clean install in stead of spliting) and we need to load their resource files and copy the patron data minus allocation history from the existing rpi instance, they are eager to get this 
1099499698 [6688] <pam/#webco> any idea when we can work this in?
1099508041 [6896] <pam/#webco> eric: bug number for rpi install/import is 7745
1099514536 [6981] <pam/#webco> is someone looking into chapman?
1099517820 [6992] <pam/#webco> chapman reporting the no duration problem
1099522257 [7067] <pam/#webco> any one know the answer to sarah at saic question about additional print queues?
1099670964 [7627] <pam/#webco> did rpi new instance get set up yesterday?
1099670980 [7633] <pam/#webco> was it even on the radar?
1099671000 [7637] <pam/#webco> whats up then
1099679130 [7728] <pam/#webco> should I be concerned that I can not see resource types in teh applet when I tunnel to chapman?
1099680394 [7730] <pam/#webco> gracchus: if you get to a point where I could get an updated head w/data for some testing that would be great
1099684538 [7740] <pam/#webco> gracchus: are you updating the head? it just went down, I get java.net exception error
1099685215 [7750] <pam/#webco> oh good!
1099685224 [7752] <pam/#webco> is it possible to get data including some media?
1099685544 [7757] <pam/#webco> ok
1099686423 [7764] <pam/#webco> when I try to tunnel to ucal I get this: HTTP ERROR: 404 /ucla/wco Not Found
1099686423 [7766] <pam/#webco> RequestURI=/ucla/wco
1099686426 [7768] <pam/#webco> any ideas?
1099686641 [7774] <pam/#webco> because my magic crystal ball is broken like webcheckout so I couldn't tell they were listening on port 80
1099690031 [7825] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did you just wipe the data from head? I was working in it and closed my browser, reopened head and now all the work I did is gone
1099696721 [7926] <pam/#webco> me too
1099933278 [7971] <pam/#webco> andy: once RPI is done or at a point where you can no longer go any further can you please move to install grinnel, bug #7701
1099935715 [8076] <pam/#webco> refusenik: patron import? evergreen? not sure what you are talking about, as far as I know evergreen is blocked due to migration problems, I am waiting for an new import to be done so I can review it, if you know something about a patron import at evergreen pls let in on it
1099936664 [8114] <pam/#webco> andy:  rpi arts dept org/checkout center is created.  They named their org and cc the same thing, that should be ok for the import right?
1099937085 [8125] <pam/#webco> criagl: i have to make a call to scad, will be about 15-20min i think
1099937677 [8133] <pam/#webco> nope, but they do need an update
1099937852 [8137] <pam/#webco> craigl: all done with scad, let me know when evergreen is ready for review

1099945984 [8264] <pam/#webco> refusenik: I selected home location at home location find form, so actual resource, no text string
1099948430 [8268] <pam/#webco> criagl: only found on weird thing, set/strike returns no data even tho there are allocations marked for set up for willcall, set/strike appears to be working on the head, not sure if what could be causing this
1099948443 [8270] <pam/#webco> refusenik: see above :)
1099952644 [8295] <pam/#webco> can someone give me artcenters url pls? i onlyhave the old one

1100112871 [8807] <pam/#webco> i need some help, Chris Dutton's (at UCLA)  patron was made inactive because he expired.  I edited his expiry date to next year but he is still inactive, His status says Active on his patron record but if I pull him up through find patron it still comes up as inactive there, can someone fix this in the database or something so he can log in?
1100113804 [8839] <pam/#webco> craigl: I am not sure what state montreal is in honestly.  Dan handled that entire install cause I don't speak a no french
1100114197 [8878] <pam/#webco> is this a file bug, give to craig situation or what?
1100115400 [8900] <pam/#webco> testing for migrated allocation data on evergreen test instance I got Servlet thread failing with: Error in function "DEFMETHOD DATABASE-QUERY (T POSTGRESQL-DATABASE)": Too many rows returned by query: 148275<br>

1100115870 [8920] <pam/#webco> fine, drop it
1100115895 [8922] <pam/#webco> evergreen has the same issue that both the UBC instances have, not too surprising, there are many missing allocations 
1100121394 [8958] <pam/#webco> andy: i am going to close that scad bug, I don't see an inconsistencies pertaining to interv. allocations
1100121412 [8960] <pam/#webco> webcheckout gnomes must have fixed it in the night
1100124102 [8988] <pam/#webco> o sure, i will call ronda
1100127168 [8991] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i would really like to test media on friday, do you think it will be possible to get that up for me early friday?
1100127222 [8999] <pam/#webco> ok
1100276217 [9312] <pam/#webco> gracchus: any luck on getting a test instance up with media for me to test?
1100278382 [9325] <pam/#webco> the new RPI department is getting this at their webcheckout instance, does this just require a restart?
1100278382 [9327] <pam/#webco> Proxy Error

1100278568 [9339] <pam/#webco> andy: are you getting that or should I attempt a restart?
1100279459 [9351] <pam/#webco> andy that is the new rpi arts department
1100279480 [9356] <pam/#webco> if I go to http://webcheckout.itops.rpi.edu./wco-arts/wco
1100279490 [9360] <pam/#webco> I DID 
1100279493 [9364] <pam/#webco> read irc
1100279504 [9368] <pam/#webco> maybe not clear enough
1100279537 [9370] <pam/#webco> i called it the new rpi instead of arts rpi
1100282005 [9404] <pam/#webco> very serious blocker at ithaca
1100282022 [9406] <pam/#webco> two reservations taking place at the same date/time with the same resource on it

1100284067 [9422] <pam/#webco> i spoke to ellen, they had to cancel the item off of one of the orders in order to move forward, today is their crazy busy day.  I asked her to email immediately if they see another conflict such as this
1100293328 [9456] <pam/#webco> andy: grinnell is installed and up right?  how can I access them?
1100293975 [9467] <pam/#webco> when doing an install you need to include setting up the admin account in your process please
1100294003 [9473] <pam/#webco> how can I access them?  I can not tunnel them because I get Name or service not known
1100294047 [9486] <pam/#webco> yes but the password information is supposed to be logged somewhere here, we set it up then give it to them and we keep that information in our password/access informtion for clients
1100294061 [9492] <pam/#webco> it has always been a part of the set up and should stay that way
1100294097 [9498] <pam/#webco> no they don't 
1100294280 [9510] <pam/#webco> I can check it out
1100294547 [9513] <pam/#webco> all i get is "update status messages" and they never load/update
1100294554 [9515] <pam/#webco> grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
1100294579 [9521] <pam/#webco> did we give concordia release or head?
1100294633 [9539] <pam/#webco> once I get to confirmation screen i get these Overrides required: 
1100294634 [9541] <pam/#webco> 
1100294634 [9545] <pam/#webco> IITS SGW in HALL is closed at scheduled return time. 
1100294634 [9549] <pam/#webco> IITS SGW in HALL is closed at scheduled pickup time. 
1100294635 [9553] <pam/#webco> Allocation start time is in the past. 
1100294671 [9560] <pam/#webco> yeah, its 195 release branch
1100294700 [9565] <pam/#webco> killing me softly with webcheckout
1100294779 [9580] <pam/#webco> ithaca has same version and  they don't get that weird stuff
1100294800 [9588] <pam/#webco> webcheckout is making my eyes bleed
1100294847 [9591] <pam/#webco> where is the liquor
1100294941 [9600] <pam/#webco> not strong enough, maybe some absinth would help
1100294979 [9604] <pam/#webco> it's after 4:30 somewhere
1100300982 [9639] <pam/#webco> trying to get webcheckout.academyart.edu and it just hangs hangs hangs in my browser, weird weird weird
1100535701 [9684] <pam/#webco> ok, please let me know if they need to be down so you can put the applet fix in place or if not then when that is in place so I can test, thanks
1100535923 [9691] <pam/#webco> fuck, still isnt working.  add patron, set times, add one resource, hear the beep but the resource never shows up in the Selected Resource box, you are unable to select another reserouce and the no resource or rtypes error still appears
1100535961 [9697] <pam/#webco> ok
1100536869 [9709] <pam/#webco> andy: do you have time to update AAU (academy art) test instance today?
1100537293 [9724] <pam/#webco> andy: aau not as urgent as other stuffs
1100537316 [9726] <pam/#webco> i really need an updated testing instance with Ithaca data to test some other reports ellen sent in, can someone do that for me?
1100537354 [9728] <pam/#webco> o wait, there may be one from friday
1100537626 [9736] <pam/#webco> ithaca has another problem with groups, not as serious as the applet not working.  Ellen puts all her resources through authoization and every time you click on manage auths from groups screen you get an error.
1100537637 [9738] <pam/#webco> i filed bug 7772
1100537670 [9742] <pam/#webco> I know craig is working on some speed loading problems discovered on friday, can we work that bug into the same update that will have that fix?
1100537676 [9745] <pam/#webco> andy: yes, i found it, thanks
1100537744 [9747] <pam/#webco> andy: i think you put those data trimming urls on the wrong bug
1100537999 [9762] <pam/#webco> yes, crack is definitely an afternoon activity
1100538749 [9772] <pam/#webco> andy: on evergreen migrated instance, on patron activity tab the future reservation are not listing, not sure if migration or bug
1100538819 [9778] <pam/#webco> andy: disregard my comment, i too but cut back on the morning crack
1100539183 [9796] <pam/#webco> andy: find invoice page is missing from kfreedom 9006, need to enable so I can view that data
1100539291 [9798] <pam/#webco> also, all patrons say imported non-editable, don't think evergreen has pintegration
1100539393 [9804] <pam/#webco> o yes, i see that now
1100540692 [9820] <pam/#webco> andy: csu has usage fees, the instance you set up does not have this, don't you have this stuff so they don't get missed?
1100544135 [9908] <pam/#webco> is there some way to turn off the turn into hold feature that now is part of the 3.1.2 release?
1100544172 [9910] <pam/#webco> artcetner on the phone, really pissy that all invoices are turning into holds where before they did not
1100544233 [9918] <pam/#webco> its not right now, it was removed as a user configured and changed to an automatic thing, afaik

1100893489 [11131] <pam/#webco> can someone tell me what data is on the head testing at liquado 2468? i used admin/admin and it won't let me in
1100893584 [11134] <pam/#webco> andy: i have many open issues on support list from the last couple of days, are you working on any so I don't start something only to find out you too are working on it?

1100897001 [11323] <pam/#webco> maybe it was theirs to start with sandford
1100898460 [11327] <pam/#webco> andy: did the head get data?
1100898916 [11339] <pam/#webco> craigl: aau having a problem with system selecting resources that are offline and putting them on orders, or allowing operators to take item offline while resource is on order, something like that, they are really busy today and would like to know if we could provide a list of resources that are offline and have allocations, is that possible?
1100898979 [11344] <pam/#webco> can you do that for me now?
1100899141 [11354] <pam/#webco> aau having a problem with system selecting resources that are offline and putting them on orders, or allowing operators to take item offline while resource is on order, something like that, they are really busy today and would like to know if we could provide a list of resources that are offline and have allocations, is that possible?
1100899575 [11360] <pam/#webco> that is the point, they don'

1100901027 [11419] <pam/#webco> craigl: i want to know if i can get a list of the resources for aau, including resource type, resource id and allocation number
1100901089 [11426] <pam/#webco> you didn't say you were getting me a list, you just ran the query, in my past exp with you i have learned that specfic and literal is always better

1101144822 [11587] <pam/#webco> andy: have you been able to confirm the report from jun that the system bumps the requested renewal time?  Have you suggested to him that he try to alter the due back time on the scheduling tab instead of on the applet?
1101146386 [11611] <pam/#webco> andy: i am remvoing uiuc from your to do based on the last email from penny stating they are going to wait to do the update
1101147317 [11633] <pam/#webco> andy and craigl: if we have a xmas party at whirly ball place would you bring a date? trying to get a number of peeps
1101147409 [11650] <pam/#webco> ok, i am going to assume you will just to get quotes then
1101147620 [11658] <pam/#webco> i think it would be us and gordon's company together, about 20 folks if all want to come, not sure yet tho cause I haven't found out the cost
1101149949 [11746] <pam/#webco> andy: email from dave at evergreen about their test coming back up, did you talk to wyatt? it seems to imply someone did
1101150013 [11750] <pam/#webco> is it still building?
1101150062 [11756] <pam/#webco> please respond to dave if you could
1101150065 [11758] <pam/#webco> i will check ubc
1101150238 [11764] <pam/#webco> andy: galios 9400 gets servlett thread error when I click on checkout center
1101150245 [11766] <pam/#webco> Servlet failing with: While using database /ubc/wco-migrate: The SQL statement: "INSERT INTO allocation
1101150253 [11768] <pam/#webco> with lots of fields after that
1101150306 [11776] <pam/#webco> ok, finish evergreen first pretty please
1101150533 [11794] <pam/#webco> ok, so are you going to get them fresh data?
1101150778 [11804] <pam/#webco> ok
1101150799 [11806] <pam/#webco> ubc should be ok for me to take a look at now?
1101151547 [11820] <pam/#webco> andy: did you do any testing on ubc galios instance?
1101151551 [11822] <pam/#webco> or have they?
1101151649 [11824] <pam/#webco> oooo, hm
1101151693 [11828] <pam/#webco> they have some resource set to autocirculate, which doesn't appear to be working in the instance they have now but it is working when updated.  we need to make sure they know that is going to start working again just in case they don't want items to autocirculate
1101151729 [11838] <pam/#webco> andy: the date/time on the activity tab of allocations for ucb says NIL instead of the migrated date/time
1101151839 [11850] <pam/#webco> also, creation time of the allocation says None on the test instance when it should store the creation date/time of the order.  
1101152421 [11858] <pam/#webco> andy: how old is ubc data? i have 10 less resource in the migrated instance than they have in their production instance
1101152502 [11864] <pam/#webco> um, what does that mean?
1101152665 [11873] <pam/#webco> hm, assuming they are bad records and need to be deleted, sketchy
1101152784 [11875] <pam/#webco> going going going to lunch

1101156424 [11899] <pam/#webco> wonder if that is screwing with the renewals?
1101156477 [11901] <pam/#webco> did you say you had a copy of their data somewhere?
1101157222 [11906] <pam/#webco> YAYAYAYAY, figured it out, it is the media circulation period screwing things up for wheaton
1101157225 [11908] <pam/#webco> on renewals
1101158388 [11923] <pam/#webco> applet on release testing doesnt load resources on edit reservation just hangs without ever loading
1101158515 [11926] <pam/#webco> release has the same problem ithaca had last monday, I click on  a resource to add to order, hear beep, never loads resource, can't choose another resource, craig fixed this, i think by putting in a different jar file?
1101160178 [11952] <pam/#webco> andy: have you been in tough with andy star at jhu who requested by assist with a back up and reinstall for them because they are installing a new hard drive? ring any bells?  per andy's email he wants to do it tomorrow or wed

1101164119 [12069] <pam/#webco> I don't get any results in find media for any checkout centers

1101758743 [13032] <pam/#webco> how could utexas have 99 non-ciculating resources that appear to have no rtype at all, is that possible? this is both on their production and on the migrated head instance
1101758984 [13036] <pam/#webco> andy: utexas head instance has no rtypes in the applet, can you fix that w/o redoing the whole thing? i have a brief window to test now and if it can't be corrected quickly I prefer to leave it for now

1101767947 [13205] <pam/#webco> andy: can you update usfca to the latest release when you get a chance, I just finished training them.  I also noticed that the Invoice icon is missing for thier installation.  They should have the ability to fine but not usage fees
1101768263 [13209] <pam/#webco> andy: what is up with rrt @ aau? dan is going to meet with them and needs to know before they cut his, um, head off
1101769528 [13232] <pam/#webco> ok, we will wait to see if it is true or just another "mysterious" problem

1101840487 [13379] <pam/#webco> yo yo
1101840606 [13381] <pam/#webco> andy: do you need help with aau report from andrei? did you test and file it already?
1101841240 [13384] <pam/#webco> craigl: i just printed an agreement form for max @ concordia it is ck70869 and should be in the /tmp file on liquado, can you email it to me please?
1101842074 [13390] <pam/#webco> gracchus: andy said you are looking into the rrt problems that he and aau reported.  Please advise if you need some assistance testing/filing problems or if you have found anything that may help them
1101842078 [13392] <pam/#webco> craigl: thank you
1101843064 [13398] <pam/#webco> andy: did you explain to andrei and the other user who called from aau about saving partial allocation to avoid a session time out in the middle of a large order?
1101845641 [13453] <pam/#webco> criagl: how about bug 7755?
1101845661 [13455] <pam/#webco> and 7771
1101845688 [13461] <pam/#webco> and 7801
1101845690 [13465] <pam/#webco> all goodies to get
1101845775 [13474] <pam/#webco> should my head testing change to include fixes to the head from yesterday? who is going to call it when we have a head or release version we would like to become release by friday?
1101846200 [13504] <pam/#webco> any opinions on head testing? should I get an update to utexas testing instance?
1101846532 [13522] <pam/#webco> ok, do you think we are ready to release to utexas? media looked pretty good to me, will do some follow up testing today with the fixes from yesterday
1101846602 [13539] <pam/#webco> yes yes, umich
1101846621 [13544] <pam/#webco> would be nice if we could collect their support contract money before we have to bill them for another year :)
1101847144 [13577] <pam/#webco> i love love love the very informative errors you get now when using accept barcode box w/rrt
1101847492 [13593] <pam/#webco> secretly I love you all but I don't want you to know that cause then you might just think my bitchy attitude is endearing or something
1101849001 [13620] <pam/#webco> criagl: i think hiding the make non-circulating if the resource is reserved or checked out works, no need to get as detailed as the take offline
1101850328 [13632] <pam/#webco> just found a new rrt bug I think, give me a sec to confirm and i will file
1101850644 [13636] <pam/#webco> is this a bug:
1101850722 [13638] <pam/#webco> if you take reservation that existed in the system in 3.0.5, then upgrade to 3.2, then go a reservation and take a resource and convert to rrt, system still thinks that the resource is assigned by id (even tho it appears as rrt on interface), it won't allow to switch by using barcode of a resource of the same type
1101850735 [13640] <pam/#webco> 3.0.5 allocated resources should be able to convert to rrt by request?
1101850743 [13642] <pam/#webco> after upgrade that is
1101850802 [13646] <pam/#webco> ok
1101852330 [13678] <pam/#webco> gracchus: do you think I should file that description i posted in irc a bit ago?
1101853488 [13706] <pam/#webco> ok, filed bug 7802
1101853559 [13709] <pam/#webco> ok, have to go pick up my neice from school, see you all tomorrow
1101853819 [13717] <pam/#webco> then 4, crazy man, but then........
1101853821 [13719] <pam/#webco> ahhhhhhhh
1101853828 [13721] <pam/#webco> bahamas!!!!!
1101917344 [13745] <pam/#webco> gracchus: eric called me last night about academyart, can you please let me know what is going on with the rrt problems there?  is there a bug open? do you need additional testing?  I have a meeting with them today at 1130 and dan is out there tomorrow, thx
1101917621 [13756] <pam/#webco> ok, is there a bug for the sandbag problem? would some more testing rrt be helpful?
1101917662 [13761] <pam/#webco> I loaded the head late yesterday afternoon on utexas and will continue testing there too, just need to make sure academyart is first priority, i think from the way eric sounded any way
1101917674 [13763] <pam/#webco> ok, so aau problem not first priority?
1101917687 [13765] <pam/#webco> i didnt' speak to eric, just got a msg
1101917756 [13771] <pam/#webco> sorry but I don't know what the current crop of problems refers too, i keep asking if there are bugs to review but it does not appear so, i am kind of out of this because andy was dealing with it but it seems eric wants me involved so sorry to be a pain about it
1101917853 [13785] <pam/#webco> ok, I will continue testing media and let aau we are working on the rrt problems in our meeting today
1101917919 [13796] <pam/#webco> the rrt problems? i havn't even touched this, andy was handling it, hence my constant request for a bug on it so I can review and add in, I don't even know what we're dealing with 
1101917964 [13812] <pam/#webco> andy: did you file a bug for the rrt sandbag issue?
1101918041 [13816] <pam/#webco> fabulous
1101918050 [13818] <pam/#webco> can i get a bug numbor for (a) please
1101918677 [13830] <pam/#webco> andy: thanks, can you pls advise the bug number for the no types supplied issue? I tried to find it but came up empty
1101918737 [13840] <pam/#webco> see jesse's explination of problems in the irc buffer, is (a) not an aau issue?
1101918760 [13845] <pam/#webco> that is sooo informative
1101918803 [13849] <pam/#webco> andy: i am sorry, I mean (b) 
1101918845 [13851] <pam/#webco> andy: reminder to please fix the applet on utexas testing instance, no rtypes, can't add patron yadda yadda yadda
1101918956 [13861] <pam/#webco> oh

1101919178 [13872] <pam/#webco> thanks andy
1101919332 [13875] <pam/#webco> andy: what is restarted? utexas testing instance on liquado? doesn't appear to have rtypes in applet still
1101920080 [13889] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i filed three new media bugs, all simple interface issues, you know its getting good if this is what I am filing!
1101920336 [13896] <pam/#webco> gracchus: i am testing head build 522 with utexas, you closed bug7799 yesterday at 10:30am, i reloaded the head about 3pm yesterday, is it possible this fix is not in the build I am testing? if it is I think it is still not working
1101920639 [13900] <pam/#webco> k, thanks
1101920655 [13902] <pam/#webco> andy: did evergreen testing instance migrate yesterday?
1101920718 [13908] <pam/#webco> damn it, where is that third hand I order for andy
1101920956 [13912] <pam/#webco> gross
1101921171 [13914] <pam/#webco> andy: utexas texting configuration has not Invoice icon, they should have fines AND the usage fee module, can you fix so I can test these?
1101923231 [13924] <pam/#webco> thanks
1101923918 [13928] <pam/#webco> andy: what is on your hit parade? there are several items on your to do list that I would like to get an update on, can we review together when you have a chance?

1101925130 [13995] <pam/#webco> UCLA really needs an update but they need a fix that is in the head now but not in current release build, when this head becomes the release (which should happen any day now) they can get that as an update, k?
1101925504 [14011] <pam/#webco> frank tate bug is fixed in the release, i will email msu
1101925588 [14013] <pam/#webco> andy: how long should I tell frank they need to be down for?

1101930733 [14038] <pam/#webco> andy: got a call from clark acton at artcenter, appears that the applet on the tool crib instance of webcheckout at artcenter is not loading rtypes, can you correct this? will they be down? please let me advise client if they are going to be down
1101931044 [14048] <pam/#webco> i will call him, his msg said it has been that way ever since we updated them a while ago

1101931166 [14060] <pam/#webco> what is the ur
1101931168 [14062] <pam/#webco> l
1101931230 [14067] <pam/#webco> oh, they must need to update their java maybe
1101931257 [14071] <pam/#webco> wouldn't restart of system/browser do that?
1101931267 [14073] <pam/#webco> he claims this has been the case for several weeks
1101931283 [14077] <pam/#webco> he is kind of a dope, i will call him
1101931537 [14088] <pam/#webco> sigh
1101931892 [14093] <pam/#webco> andy: should I be able to reach the academyart testing instance? i really need to do some testing of that rrt problem to provide more detail on the bug
1101931913 [14095] <pam/#webco> if I try to access it just seems to hang in my browser
1101932299 [14117] <pam/#webco> andy: i was trying to access http://webcheckout.academyart.edu:9009

1101939200 [14191] <pam/#webco> gracchus: did you make any headway on the rrt problems, andrei is getting very frustrated, I added more of his comments to the bug
1101939657 [14193] <pam/#webco> andy: it does not appear that the academyart testing instance has rrt enabled on it, can you please correct that?

1101942470 [14251] <pam/#webco> andy: have you been able to reproduce andrei's reports during testing or have you only seen the wacked out mess he gets?
1101942712 [14260] <pam/#webco> ok, i am trying on the test instance and so far have not seen anything out of the ordinary but I can't mimick his real time use
1101943429 [14262] <pam/#webco> any one want to fess up to helping umich with MARC record updates in the past?
1101943440 [14264] <pam/#webco> they need someone to assist with some file changes

1102012800 [14324] <pam/#webco> we could probably do it now
1102012805 [14326] <pam/#webco> let me check with larry
1102013156 [14338] <pam/#webco> 70882 is the one I just made, I will file the activity tab times and creation times did not migrate bug

1102019117 [14359] <pam/#webco> hey ya'll, this in from jeff pearson @umich, who is going to be the contact for MARC data structure?
1102019159 [14364] <pam/#webco> The library systems people are working on the MARC file so we can resume the import, and would like to talk with you about a couple of possible changes to the structure of the file. I think it would be more efficient if our systems person, Don Plantinga (dplan@umich.edu), communicated with you directly. Who would be the best person for Don to contact at onshore support?
1102020805 [14374] <pam/#webco> soon to be vacating, about 10 min, if you need anything ask now pls
1102021058 [14378] <pam/#webco> mmmm biscuts and gravy

1102957675 [2061] <pam/#webco> andy: did usfca get an update while I was gone?
1102958150 [2067] <pam/#webco> andy: not sure if you saw my questin before leaving irc, did you update usfca while I was gone last week?
1102959115 [2106] <pam/#webco> andy: session bookmarks have always caused a bug asfaik, tell frank to change the bookmarks to  urls that don't include any session information
1102959127 [2110] <pam/#webco> as for the set/strike problem, did you confirm the problem?
1102959129 [2112] <pam/#webco> cool
1102959172 [2122] <pam/#webco> weird, I could have sworn I checked that b/f they were updated.  There was a bug filed a couple weeks ago about set/strike being off by 12 hours, maybe that was not moved into the release
1102959200 [2130] <pam/#webco> can you move that fix over do you know?
1102959386 [2136] <pam/#webco> who is wearing the hat today?
1102960527 [2209] <pam/#webco> andy: msu has a lot of unsaved allocations listing in their set/strike, I assume this is the problem dan explained to me today when I came in that was causing problems for aau and chapman, can these allocations be cleaned up for msu?
1102960962 [2260] <pam/#webco> andy: did msu not get the correct update or something?
1102961578 [2306] <pam/#webco> andy: i was going off of the 2000 unsaved allocation line items that come up when you first load them msu set/strike, maybe that is not the same thing
1102961619 [2317] <pam/#webco> not sure
1102965112 [2406] <pam/#webco> andy: did evergreen testing instance on their server get set up this weekend?
1102965984 [2409] <pam/#webco> andy: there was a support email from a user at chapman on friday morning, actually sent 4 sep times, I do not see a response from you, did you call them?
1102966089 [2417] <pam/#webco> also a report from chapman of recurring run-rtype error, i don't see a response to that either

1102968902 [2493] <pam/#webco> andy: I need biola patron file loaded from bug 7533, I added it to your to do list, pls advise when you have this up for review
1102968931 [2495] <pam/#webco> does not have to be today but if you could advise when you could fit this in I would appreciate it
1102970506 [2499] <pam/#webco> andy: usfca is missing the invoice icon, why why why why do I have to check this all the time??? aren't there some checks that are in place to make sure everything installs during installs/upgrades? can you please fix this
1102970586 [2501] <pam/#webco> andy: you did not update usfca last week, their version check says last update 11/24

1103303932 [6196] <pam/#webco> if an operator tries to change a resources checkout center, should the system stop them from doing so if the resource has future allocation in the current checkout center?

1103574961 [10011] <pam/#webco> ok, you need to be more specific with me I think, I copies that command and it didn't seem to work 
1103575373 [10035] <pam/#webco> thanks craigl
1103575500 [10041] <pam/#webco> ok
1103737902 [11361] <pam/#webco> andy: is there a specific place on the webco server where clients should place the patron file drop nightly file or can they just put it somewhere and advise us where?
1103750074 [11492] <pam/#webco> andy: can you jiggy that insurance form on over to me please?
1103758619 [11590] <pam/#webco> time to go, everyone have a nice holiday and I will see you next week!
1104265464 [13446] <pam/#webco> andy: any idea what dave c's email is in refernce to? are they still testing or have they updated their production yet?
1104338898 [13715] <pam/#webco> andy: can you tell me what date you performed the denver upgrade on?
1104338913 [13721] <pam/#webco> lori is like talking to wood
1104339449 [13754] <pam/#webco> andy: can you tell if there has been work or a lot of work in the new instance
1104339492 [13757] <pam/#webco> if there is not, lori is good with the idea of remigrating
1104339862 [13772] <pam/#webco> can you identify it for me? give me a ck or something and advise where I can view it from?
1104339945 [13785] <pam/#webco> well, I would like to know what date, patron or something I can tell lori so she knows which allocation has to be reentered
1104340113 [13798] <pam/#webco> yip yip
1104340130 [13801] <pam/#webco> you can begin re-migration any time, they are not working in webco today
1104340166 [13811] <pam/#webco> let me know when you are going to do it, i told her i would call her back
1104340171 [13814] <pam/#webco> ill check
1104340252 [13816] <pam/#webco> nope, no pir
1104340282 [13830] <pam/#webco> :)
1104340318 [13836] <pam/#webco> sometimes you need to spank dan
1104340347 [13846] <pam/#webco> can you say "control freak"
1104340392 [13856] <pam/#webco> don't get your hopes up
1104341135 [13862] <pam/#webco> andy: lcc upgrade was completed?
1104342216 [13880] <pam/#webco> andy: can you give me the new url?  I don't see an email from you to them confirming upgrade and providing new url
1104342636 [13899] <pam/#webco> ok, i tried lansing.webhcheckout.net and got mod webapp error
1104342737 [13915] <pam/#webco> andy: i would say in the future that even if dan is handling client communications that we send out support emails to the client, an obvious needed measure considering denver situation
1104342968 [13923] <pam/#webco> I know, gotten caught in that trap myself, but you must fight your urge to go to the dark side
1104344240 [13940] <pam/#webco> andy: no
1104344312 [13945] <pam/#webco> andy: this is the last email i have from you to ucla regarding update: When would be a good time to take care of the postgres update?  Should I
1104344313 [13947] <pam/#webco> direct that question to Chris?
1104344326 [13951] <pam/#webco> did you get a response to that question or are we stalled there?
1104344338 [13953] <pam/#webco> that email was from 12/20
1104344783 [13959] <pam/#webco> andy: have you started denver yet?
1104345467 [13984] <pam/#webco> andy: ucla is stalled waiting for a response to that question?
1104345507 [13986] <pam/#webco> andy: can you compose email to lori with the correct url please?
1104345526 [13990] <pam/#webco> or give me the url and I will do it
1104345786 [14015] <pam/#webco> yep, cause I am out all next week and I have to make sure you miss me
1104345836 [14020] <pam/#webco> andy: if only that comment about denver url helped me in any way, other than making me scratch my head and ponder the meaning of life
1104345876 [14028] <pam/#webco> very good then
1104346075 [14036] <pam/#webco> what does that mean for me or denver end user?
1104346080 [14038] <pam/#webco> anything?
1104346220 [14046] <pam/#webco> k
1104346236 [14060] <pam/#webco> yep
1104346339 [14066] <pam/#webco> andy: please clarify, ucla is stalled waiting for a response to your question, yes?
1104346357 [14068] <pam/#webco> sorry to be a pain today but I need to leave a "where everything is at" list for eric next week
1104349964 [14095] <pam/#webco> i am going to the gym, be back in about an hour
1104354550 [14159] <pam/#webco> andy: can you check out email sent to support from me just now, lori says webco still down or she can get it using the url you provided
1104355275 [14168] <pam/#webco> hello
1104355279 [14174] <pam/#webco> andy?
1104355285 [14176] <pam/#webco> you out there little buddy
1104355772 [14216] <pam/#webco> andy: do you have to talk to lori, can you just call karl?
1104355837 [14218] <pam/#webco> criagl: i will check out bug 7837
1104358861 [14248] <pam/#webco> craigl: ok, i don't see the problems dave reported either
1104359324 [14256] <pam/#webco> andy: i am testing a copy of head w/aau data, i get no resources in the applet, is this a configuration issue or should I file a blocker bug?
1104359364 [14258] <pam/#webco> I get no user matches when I try to enter a patron, seems like a configuration issue, can you check it out? it is at liquado:2000
1104359525 [14260] <pam/#webco> andy: which version of sun java do advise lori to use?
1104359641 [14262] <pam/#webco> andy: i should send her the instructions for this: Windows Automatic Download and Installation Instructions for the Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (JRE) 
1104359652 [14264] <pam/#webco> right?
1104360128 [14268] <pam/#webco> andy: you can run but you can't hide
1104360137 [14270] <pam/#webco> disregard question about java, figured it out
1104360165 [14272] <pam/#webco> but can you please check out my head testing instance on liquado:2000, please please please please please please
1104361602 [14280] <pam/#webco> grrrrr, i hate browsers
1104361955 [14288] <pam/#webco> going home, see you all tomorrow for more fun
1104423958 [14539] <pam/#webco> andy: are you working on evergreen update?
1104424305 [14551] <pam/#webco> I don't remember that report, do you know what day it came in?
1104424435 [14562] <pam/#webco> never mind, i found it using your handy little search tool
1104424461 [14568] <pam/#webco> very cool
1104424467 [14572] <pam/#webco> ok
1104424750 [14576] <pam/#webco> i am trying to get to ithaca and the redirect of ithaca.webcheckout.net doesnt seem to work any more and of course I did not write down their new url, can someone please help me out and put it in irc
1104424823 [14583] <pam/#webco> nevermind
1104424826 [14585] <pam/#webco> on the ithaca thing
1104424838 [14590] <pam/#webco> andy: can you advise what release version dave is testing please
1104424855 [14594] <pam/#webco> or give me the url for their testing instance
1104425008 [14600] <pam/#webco> release 235, which is what lansing has does not have the choose patron problem
1104425134 [14616] <pam/#webco> I guess I am yet again confused by our relase procedure
1104425145 [14623] <pam/#webco> why would dave have a later release build than any other release
1104425159 [14626] <pam/#webco> there is really no testing except for client testing going on right now
1104425168 [14630] <pam/#webco> why are we building and shipping untested release builds?
1104425247 [14646] <pam/#webco> well if release builds keep getting built and there is no testing going on then how can it not end up broken
1104425297 [14654] <pam/#webco> big sigh
1104425618 [14678] <pam/#webco> criagl: that choose patron bug is invalid
1104425625 [14684] <pam/#webco> both andy and I tested and confirmed, I am closing bug
1104425838 [14687] <pam/#webco> ok, is head bug
1104431709 [14940] <pam/#webco> andy: did ucla respond with a new time to update postgres?
1104431765 [14948] <pam/#webco> ok, pls advise when it is complete
1104431941 [14951] <pam/#webco> why is there a Fing Gr.. button on the head applet? What is that for?
1104431947 [14953] <pam/#webco> it's next to the patron box
1104432136 [14963] <pam/#webco> ok, so that would only appear on usc?
1104432254 [14967] <pam/#webco> it on aau head testing
1104432270 [14971] <pam/#webco> but it only makes sense to usc, no one else is going to know what to do with it, so is that a bug?
1104432416 [14979] <pam/#webco> it takes up screen space for those client that use the Academic level field which is supposed to come up next to the patron ID
1104433230 [14988] <pam/#webco> when I install release version to a testing instance I get build 210, we are currently on build 236, does something need to happen to keep that build testing instance page up to date?
1104435336 [15000] <pam/#webco> thank you 
1104435803 [15008] <pam/#webco> thank you
1104435818 [15010] <pam/#webco> andy: did you fix the invoice status unset migration problem denver had yesterday?
1104435877 [15016] <pam/#webco> cool
1104435939 [15018] <pam/#webco> andy: I updating the to do list on snip snap, very out dated.  The first item on your list is saic migration bug #7375.  This bug has not been updated since end of november but I am sure you have done much work on it since then, can you update that bug please
1104436922 [15038] <pam/#webco> gracchus: ok, pls advise when I can take a look, i really would like to test home location on their data b/f I leave for vaca
1104436932 [15042] <pam/#webco> which is end of day today, btw :)
1104437269 [15050] <pam/#webco> trying to tunnel to umontreal and I get this in my terminal: webcheckout@meriones.dgtic.umontreal.ca's password: 
1104437628 [15059] <pam/#webco> nm
1104438041 [15069] <pam/#webco> criagl: trying to load a mail I found but it just takes me back to query mail page:  a06002004bd74aa9b820e@[68.166.153.125]
1104439502 [15074] <pam/#webco> http://hm.onshored.com:8000/a06002004bd74aa9b820e@%5B68.166.153.125%5D
1104440436 [15078] <pam/#webco> gracchus: any luck with ucla?
1105375456 [21744] <pam/#webco> thanks for the coffee gracchus, its yummy
1105377887 [21775] <pam/#webco> yes there is a check box for print receipt but I don't know what the pages and pages spit out are all about
1105378202 [21784] <pam/#webco> andy: an email came in from dave at evergreen last monday about there being no invoice icon on his instance.  There was no response to his email and I just checked and there is still no invoice icon
1105381536 [21822] <pam/#webco> andy: there was an email from angie at UCLA to you last tuesday about their test server, I do not see a response to you, did you respond? is there an update to their install status?
1105381540 [21824] <pam/#webco> andy: thanks on the evergreen thing
1105381855 [21834] <pam/#webco> sfsu yikes
1105381910 [21838] <pam/#webco> chevalier: i am going to need you bad bad bad for this
1105383030 [21860] <pam/#webco> dan is looking on my terminal
1105383927 [21910] <pam/#webco> andy: there was an email from your to morgan at ubc about a missing button, I assume he responded to you instead of support, can you advise which button he is missing?
1105384208 [21929] <pam/#webco> chevailer: did we give email to ubc and company? I don't have them in my sales records as purchasing email modules
1105384572 [21951] <pam/#webco> easy there killer, dan may have added it into another sale so it may not be clear through the sales schedule, I am sure he will clarify when he gets a chance, I am 99% certain he would remember correctly, I am just confirming
1105384694 [21980] <pam/#webco> cool
1105385242 [22002] <pam/#webco> andy: I just forwarded a message to support from Larry M. @ usfca who needs help setting up printing
1105390688 [22125] <pam/#webco> andy: looking at aau report about complete patron history, seems like the find checkout/reservation search function is wacked out
1105390746 [22127] <pam/#webco> If i do a search for matt braun for all allocation states I get 51 results which are a mix of returned allocations and cancelled reservations, If I do a search for just for completed checkouts, I get 50 results, all returned allocations, those numbers do not add up
1105390772 [22129] <pam/#webco> I then did a search for all completed allocations in the issue room and got a wopping 122 results, sooooo not right
1105390800 [22135] <pam/#webco> 1000
1105390842 [22139] <pam/#webco> that certainly ups the result number
1105390859 [22141] <pam/#webco> i get 116 results for matt instead of 51
1105390917 [22153] <pam/#webco> yep
1105390965 [22167] <pam/#webco> groovy
1105390985 [22169] <pam/#webco> andy: i will respond to andrei
1105391160 [22171] <pam/#webco> chevalier: there was an email sent to you and jesse from Jeff P. @ Umich on 1/5/05, subject: local notes file, I don't think it has been responded to
1105391588 [22182] <pam/#webco> andy: taking the scissors off my desk and not returning them is a serious offence
1105391707 [22191] <pam/#webco> andy: concordia down down, can you restart pls?
1105392863 [22287] <pam/#webco> andy: i am having a brain freeze, did we install grinnell college?
1105392984 [22311] <pam/#webco> phew
1105393354 [22417] <pam/#webco> chevalier: i have not worked with umich at all, I don't even know what he is asking, it was eric managing them I think
1105393378 [22439] <pam/#webco> I just noticed it went unanswered and wanted to make sure it was on the radar
1105397062 [460] <pam/#webco> andy: I have a patron file from grinnell, can you try to load if for me and see if there are any problems?
1105397196 [463] <pam/#webco> bug 7860 has file attached
1105400391 [546] <pam/#webco> andy: was that a no?
1105547168 [983] <pam/#webco> andy: did you do the grinnell patron import?
1105547930 [1042] <pam/#webco> I spoke to the woman, can
1105547939 [1044] <pam/#webco> 't remember her name
1105547946 [1046] <pam/#webco> on monday, she said she would send over the file
1105548009 [1054] <pam/#webco> havn't gotten a hold of that guy yet, give me to end of today pls
1105551075 [1080] <pam/#webco> chevalier: still on with denver?  do you want to explain their problems to me and have me take over so andy and I can work with them instead of taking your sales time?
1105552918 [1125] <pam/#webco> andy: can we update ithaca production instance to the build you put up for ellen yesterday after 4pm today?
1105553473 [1155] <pam/#webco> andy: yes, I understand what she is talking about, its a new bug, also reported by aau, I will test and file as soon as I get a chance
1105554122 [1165] <pam/#webco> I created an allocation on denver that if I try to access it gives me an error, it is ck 17990 and the error is Servlet failing with: No matching method for the generic function #<STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION WCOF::COMPUTE-CHARGE (6) {58BA1CE9}>, when called with arguments (NIL #<WCOF::NORMALIZED-POLICY-SET {59286F75}> #<WALL-TIME: 2005-01-12 17:06:00> #<WALL-TIME: 2005-01-12 11:21:55>).<br>
1105554143 [1168] <pam/#webco> any chance you can take a look at that and see if anything jumps out at you as to why that is happening
1105554167 [1170] <pam/#webco> I selected two resources that had flat usage fees and had the allocation start in the past
1105554182 [1173] <pam/#webco> this is the same error lori claimed she got yesterday trying to log in to the system
1105554187 [1177] <pam/#webco> I can't make is come up for that 
1105554208 [1185] <pam/#webco> if this is too much for you let me know and I will just file a bug and have craigl take a look when he gets a chance
1105554388 [1193] <pam/#webco> you must learn to multi-task
1105556409 [1221] <pam/#webco> andy: can you tell me what the ubc faced url is now please?
1105557102 [1246] <pam/#webco> andy, put the whole address together

1105558169 [1349] <pam/#webco> refusenik: nope
1105558195 [1351] <pam/#webco> says show last 12 runs and no data comes up
1105558316 [1360] <pam/#webco> wait, hold on, I think i looked at wrong school
1105558361 [1366] <pam/#webco> yes, sorry, too many webcheckout windows open at the same time
1105559037 [1437] <pam/#webco> andy: can you cancel a checkout on denver that I made for testing purposes but now gives me a bug through the interface so I can cant return the item?
1105559115 [1442] <pam/#webco> ck 17990
1105559996 [1448] <pam/#webco> refusenik: i ran the integration again, got success banner on processes tab but the integration log is the same, last one 9/21 failure
1105560464 [1468] <pam/#webco> thanks, it is a big issue for them which I am sure jane wong will chew my ear off over it
1105560563 [1470] <pam/#webco> andy: did you look into the report from accd about csv not working? you said you would after some process stopped running
1105560613 [1480] <pam/#webco> swell
1105560665 [1482] <pam/#webco> what about email that came in from Mike Shepard, can we make the two items he needs circulating circulting since we took the option from the interface?
1105560670 [1484] <pam/#webco> that was for andy
1105561061 [1544] <pam/#webco> refusenik: that appears to have worked!yay
1105561071 [1546] <pam/#webco> refusenik: will the nightly job run correctly now you think?
1105561174 [1557] <pam/#webco> k, you will still work on that then?
1105561654 [1616] <pam/#webco> jane wong, grrrrrrrr
1105563485 [1634] <pam/#webco> refusenik: ok, will get back to you, my limit is 4 things at once :)
1105563508 [1636] <pam/#webco> andy: can you advise status of ucla update please, did angie lee get back to you?
1105563725 [1642] <pam/#webco> andy: i have been after the ucla update for weeks and weeks and weeks, what is the deal with them always getting the 
1105563728 [1644] <pam/#webco> eventually?
1105564009 [1652] <pam/#webco> andy: I am not convinced that the ccenter of resources not matching the org of a rtype is causing the problem.  I am not even sure if that is an allowed behavior.  I checked the resources on the order 17990 and they both appear to be from ccenter multimedia and rtypes from the org multimedia, do you see differently in the dbase?
1105564056 [1670] <pam/#webco> look, I know you have a lot going on but the ucla thing was the top of my list when I went away the first week of december and the top of my list when I went away a month later and they are still getting the eventually, or the "o yeah"
1105564387 [1682] <pam/#webco> andy: what do you mean by circ policy hosed?
1105564855 [1701] <pam/#webco> that is very strange
1105564893 [1705] <pam/#webco> is there any way to get a test case, maybe narrow it down to one policy instead all?
1105564964 [1717] <pam/#webco> wacky for sure, but I do think it is just lori being clueless
1105564994 [1726] <pam/#webco> that would be my guess
1105565039 [1732] <pam/#webco> do you think I should just advise her to re-set the policy she desires on 250W Loudspeakers and advise if she runs into the problem again?
1105565113 [1736] <pam/#webco> k
1105565145 [1742] <pam/#webco> you lose me there
1105565196 [1756] <pam/#webco> as for ucla, I have to get back to Chris Dutton and again give him a plan for update, it seems from the emails between you and angie that I have seen the current plan is a test install on their server? is that right?
1105565204 [1759] <pam/#webco> I will call lori back
1105565322 [1766] <pam/#webco> ok, that is a test install or it will be a production install?
1105566124 [1786] <pam/#webco> my brain hurts
1105567563 [1801] <pam/#webco> why would the system be blocking allocations from set/strike which all have the same delivery location, very very strange
1105575329 [1849] <pam/#webco> andy: I can not access grinnell at 
1105575340 [1851] <pam/#webco> av.grinnell.edu/wco/wco/
1105575348 [1853] <pam/#webco> can you check that out for me please?
1105722124 [2645] <pam/#webco> if there is data there, otherwise I build and instance from that site jesse built and use that
1105722291 [2656] <pam/#webco> is 270 really the release?
1105722451 [2658] <pam/#webco> wah wah
1105722466 [2660] <pam/#webco> andy: if I try to tunnel to ithaca I get an apache test page
1105722470 [2662] <pam/#webco> what up with dat?
1105722789 [2666] <pam/#webco> i put in the full url the terminal gave me, should I add /wco?
1105722837 [2668] <pam/#webco> oy, can we patch denver with the fix to the 12 hour off set/strike problem?
1105722846 [2672] <pam/#webco> i think that is fixed
1105723209 [2707] <pam/#webco> andy: I will call lori once I get through my emails 
1105725747 [2735] <pam/#webco> i need to get into ithaca, I think I can go direct but I don't have their new url, someone want to give it to me please, pretty please
1105726672 [2776] <pam/#webco> thanks craigl
1105726687 [2780] <pam/#webco> andy: ellen is happily re-entering, can you take that liquado istance down please?
1105727871 [2802] <pam/#webco> andy: i guess you got an email from lori that she did not cc support to? can you forward?
1105728744 [2845] <pam/#webco> sorry, didn't mean to start a frenzy, it seemed like you were talking about something lori sent in, I could have misunderstood
1105729694 [2855] <pam/#webco> andy: I have andrei from aau on phone, you told him you was going to upate their test instance to latest release for review/update, did you do that?  andrei is having some weird troubles with timeline 
1105729964 [2858] <pam/#webco> criagl: when I go to the url I had bookmarked for mail search I just get a page of html code
1105729969 [2861] <pam/#webco> I was using http://hm.onshored.com:8000/
1105730122 [2867] <pam/#webco> thanks
1105730244 [2870] <pam/#webco> andy: trying to connect to that url times out my browser
1105730318 [2872] <pam/#webco> can you reach it?
1105730430 [2878] <pam/#webco> their regular instance is not firewalled
1105730760 [2894] <pam/#webco> its ok, andrei will advise if he has trouble
1105730766 [2896] <pam/#webco> denver seems in a bad way
1105733489 [2935] <pam/#webco> here is one ck at denver that produces servlett thread error ck-18013, i will try to find more
1105733717 [2941] <pam/#webco> here is another CK-18010
1105733849 [2947] <pam/#webco> andy: are you sure conflicting resource schedules aren't for unserialized resources?
1105734045 [2976] <pam/#webco> some allocation seem to be in weird states, I am looking at 16467, in the summary it says "Allocation altered but not yet committed" and there is a reset button as if this allocation is half in edit phase
1105734073 [2978] <pam/#webco> but the allocation say Reservation CK-16467
1105734580 [2990] <pam/#webco> you should be able to schedule them and many times as you want to w/o ever having a conflict
1105734586 [2992] <pam/#webco> as many
1105740000 [3055] <pam/#webco> andy: i will call pete
1105742595 [3075] <pam/#webco> andy: andrei at aau likes the new release, he would like us to update them on Monday, they get the holiday off so we can do it anytime
1105742616 [3077] <pam/#webco> ill remind you on monday
1105745011 [3121] <pam/#webco> eric: tested denver on the orders that were previously giving servlett threads and they appear as normal now
1105745024 [3123] <pam/#webco> craigl: ok, thanks
1105978898 [3357] <pam/#webco> andy: did you see email from lori at denver late onFriday about update-invoice status you said you were going to run? is run?
1105979461 [3365] <pam/#webco> andy: ok, I will take a look at denvers invoices
1105979483 [3367] <pam/#webco> andy: did you see email from angie at ucla late on friday? can you check to see if you can reach their box now please?
1105993609 [3444] <pam/#webco> andy: pls don't forget we need to update aau to the current release today :)
1105997464 [3470] <pam/#webco> andy: biola has another patron file they need loaded, can you do that? its on bug 7533
1105997562 [3474] <pam/#webco> andy: there will also be a grinnell resource import, I will let you know bug number by end of the day, if you could attempt that some time tomorrow I would appreciate it
1106000777 [3611] <pam/#webco> criagl: ellen is having a few problems with groups still, eris said is was ok if I asked you to take a look at the bugs and see if you could fix them an apply fixes to her instance.
1106000833 [3620] <pam/#webco> the bug numbers are 7878 and 7865, can I assign these to you and do you have time to look at them tomorrow?>
1106003028 [3679] <pam/#webco> craigl: did you see my questions above?
1106003558 [3687] <pam/#webco> no, that was it, thanks
1106004353 [3694] <pam/#webco> andy: did aau get updated today?
1106156062 [4262] <pam/#webco> criagl: when you are ready I am happy to review the groups stuff with you
1106156093 [4264] <pam/#webco> nack: get back on the couch and drink a beer!
1106156148 [4274] <pam/#webco> inactive in the system or inactive in the group?
1106156247 [4292] <pam/#webco> by inactive, do you mean they are inactive Patrons or that thier authorization expired and they are inactive in the group?
1106157555 [4304] <pam/#webco> criagl: i need the admin pword for grinnell, I don't think I got it from andy, can you call me with it?
1106159436 [4317] <pam/#webco> criagl: i have a small resource import for grinnel that I need done for some training on Friday, can you take a stab at running it for me?
1106159459 [4319] <pam/#webco> i have all the files, I have created the org and ccenter, if you can do it pls advise where you would like me to put the files
1106160028 [4328] <pam/#webco> criagl: no, no resource now
1106160151 [4331] <pam/#webco> on my Public directory:  OSX/Users/pam/Public/grinnell resource files copy
1106161750 [4340] <pam/#webco> craigl: lori at denver emailed, I get a message that says forbidden from this server. I cannot access thade at http://thade.uts.du.edu/
1106161768 [4346] <pam/#webco> i tried to access them as well and get the forbidden msg, do you know what that is?
1106161949 [4353] <pam/#webco> are you checking? lori is on the phone now, or is this on their end?
1106162796 [4374] <pam/#webco> nack: what about denver invoicing problems? you found nothing with that?
1106164898 [4403] <pam/#webco> nack: from what I can tell, invoicing for denver is a big ball of mess, I am investigating now with eric's help
1106165043 [4409] <pam/#webco> ill check
1106165098 [4411] <pam/#webco> july of 2001
1106165172 [4417] <pam/#webco> would that affect invoices?
1106165186 [4421] <pam/#webco> effect
1106165558 [4431] <pam/#webco> o my
1106165620 [4435] <pam/#webco> nack: what is one to do? I def. have seen some weird data/repored missing data ets
1106165621 [4437] <pam/#webco> etc
1106170854 [4517] <pam/#webco> nack: any suggestions on what to do about that?
1106172872 [4580] <pam/#webco> nack: when I was working with lori I noticed I-4041 which had some strange listings in the history that seemed to take place before the invoice was even created
1106172926 [4584] <pam/#webco> I also saw I-4069 which had items in the history that appeared that charges had been waived but lori had to re-waive them and she claims she already paid that invoice before the update but this is no record of payment
1106172930 [4586] <pam/#webco> craigl: ok, thanks
1106173028 [4588] <pam/#webco> criagl: i don't see any resources in grinnell
1106173225 [4602] <pam/#webco> damn
1106173441 [4612] <pam/#webco> nack: she paid it, she even gave me the reciept (account #) she used in the description of the payment, if that helps, J0115939
1106173530 [4616] <pam/#webco> nack: also, I am looking at I-6012, there is  a charge on the invoice for $43 which according to the history was waived back on 1/27/03 but if you look at charges/credits and balance of the invoice it is still showing the charge
1106173538 [4618] <pam/#webco> thing def. seem out of wack
1106173702 [4632] <pam/#webco> on this history of i-6012?

1106173775 [4680] <pam/#webco> nack: ok, I don't know what to say about that, there are def. problems on I-4069 with waived as well, maybe that screwed it up
1106173849 [4689] <pam/#webco> criagl: yes
1106173875 [4693] <pam/#webco> nack: i see
1106174891 [4716] <pam/#webco> nack: sorry, 0612
1106174903 [4722] <pam/#webco> the invoice number
1106174920 [4726] <pam/#webco> not 6012, it is 0612
1106175438 [4766] <pam/#webco> a recharge invoice implies it is going to be paid by account (another department), not by say cash or credit
1106176046 [4792] <pam/#webco> sorry
1106176068 [4800] <pam/#webco> nack: that should not unwaive an invoice
1106177505 [4880] <pam/#webco> nack: i am still here
1106177578 [4886] <pam/#webco> eric: bug number for deliver to problems at denver blocker #7886
1106178366 [4915] <pam/#webco> if an invoice is non-recharge it could have a zero balance and still be pending awaiting journalling, if the invoice is recharge a zero balance should equal a paid invoice
1106178459 [4921] <pam/#webco> wait, sorry, reverse those, non-recharge expects a cash payment, recharge expects an account number payment
1106178490 [4930] <pam/#webco> crailg: they are listed in bug 7886, or at least an example of them is, there are many many locations at denver and I can't audit all of them
1106178586 [4955] <pam/#webco> the later it gets the more creative it get
1106324738 [5418] <pam/#webco> a non-recharge invoice says "cash" on the interface of the invoice instead of non-recharge, I saw this on denver, I have not filed a bug for it yet
1106324769 [5420] <pam/#webco> you still search for non-recharge and the find invoice results still say non-recharge, it seems to be on the interface of the invoice only, asfaik
1106327363 [5447] <pam/#webco> craigl: when you loaded grinnell resources did you wipe out their patron load? they don't have any patrons now
1106329833 [5461] <pam/#webco> yep, I will  need those reloaded after I am done with training
1106331921 [5465] <pam/#webco> andy or craigl: can someone reload grinnell patrons please, they are going to start using and need those as soon as possible
1106331974 [5469] <pam/#webco> file is on bug 7860
1106332841 [5476] <pam/#webco> cragil: the denver set/strike looks good on hm.  Was that a denver specific problem or something we will see at other schools using that release?
1106332892 [5479] <pam/#webco> andy: can I get grinnell updated to release 270 and their patrons reloaded please?
1106332980 [5485] <pam/#webco> damn it, I am getting another servlet error at denver on CK-18013
1106332988 [5487] <pam/#webco> Servlet failing with: Type-error in KERNEL::OBJECT-NOT-LIST-ERROR-HANDLER: " ((3000 (1 :HOURS)))" is not of type LIST<br>
1106333084 [5494] <pam/#webco> can you correct it? or what should be the proper next step for that?
1106333216 [5499] <pam/#webco> that is on their production instance
1106334436 [5505] <pam/#webco> criagl: no, thanks
1106334548 [5507] <pam/#webco> criagl: the same order has a rtype on it with a simple fee of $30/hr that is not getting assessed, is that releated to that error?
1106334700 [5509] <pam/#webco> andy: Michael from ubc has now sent in request for three items that are marked as non-circulating that need to be circulating, with no response from us, can you fix those for him please?
1106336283 [5520] <pam/#webco> no, they didn't purchase it, so that would explain the error, the link should not be visable on the interface tho right?
1106337908 [5551] <pam/#webco> i will call lori and ask, are their invoices corrected? should/can we do both at same time if not?
1106338068 [5564] <pam/#webco> andy: i need to contact her for the deliver report fix, i can ask her both together
1106338203 [5566] <pam/#webco> left her msg.  i will advise when i hear from her
1106339083 [5588] <pam/#webco> andy: how bout grinnell?
1106339142 [5600] <pam/#webco> email should not be configured right? so wouldn't the email button be gone from interface?
1106339162 [5608] <pam/#webco> ok, I will take care of telling her that she does not have email module
1106339180 [5612] <pam/#webco> np
1106339247 [5614] <pam/#webco> criagl: i have a questions bout setting circulation policy to zero, if you set Usage hours per week and Reservation hours per week to zero does the system think that there is no policy set or does the system think that this piece of equipment should not be used for any amount of time?
1106339280 [5616] <pam/#webco> andy: can you please load the second biola patron file on their production instance?
1106339319 [5620] <pam/#webco> file is on bug 7533
1106339605 [5625] <pam/#webco> andy: there is an unsaved allocation on grinnell that I think is causing and error in the set/strike
1106339647 [5627] <pam/#webco> no matter what i set the dates to this unsaved allocation comes up in the result set
1106339666 [5629] <pam/#webco> when I try to run the export as task list, I get Servlet failing with: No matching method for the generic function #<STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION ODCL:GET-PROPERTY (9) {5840CC59}>, when called with arguments (NIL :NAME).<br>
1106339762 [5635] <pam/#webco> andy: nevermind, i figured a way around it for the time being
1106339971 [5639] <pam/#webco> thanks much
1106340806 [5646] <pam/#webco> andy: biola now has a total of 4 patrons, i think something went not so good there
1106340900 [5652] <pam/#webco> also, I am going to reopen that bug because we are not done with pintegration, that will come later
1106340989 [5654] <pam/#webco> oh, wait somehow they all became inactive patrons
1106341016 [5656] <pam/#webco> what happened?
1106341561 [5660] <pam/#webco> hello andy
1106341565 [5662] <pam/#webco> yo yo yo

1106342968 [5672] <pam/#webco> andy: just in time for new head aches from aau, can you check out andrei email that just came in?
1106584591 [6036] <pam/#webco> andy: can you help me get to our wireless network from my laptop?  I need a password to access malardnet (which I assume is ours)
1106585806 [6046] <pam/#webco> criagl: yes, i will call lori again
1106586736 [6082] <pam/#webco> andy: did cairo ever get email module installed?
