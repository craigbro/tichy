You thought that I was weak, Huh let me speak
My rhymes come funkier than your grandfather's weeps
(Dirty) So listen hear mister don't you ever forget
The rhym'n Dirty, you couldn't even clean if you commit
Or even boring, some try ajax, only mess with the best, 48 trackz (Yo)
I get down with the a saw sound
lyrics that be flowin from miiiiles around 
So let the music shut yo' ass up
and throw the upper cut that will make you fall onto yo butt

Sell me, I know my funk be kickin'
Turnin' heads like an 8 foot tropical mud chicken
