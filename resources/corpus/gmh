I BEAR a basket lined with grass;
I am so light, I am so fair,
That men must wonder as I pass
And at the basket that I bear,
Where in a newly-drawn green litter        5
Sweet flowers I carry,&#151;sweets for bitter.
 

Lilies I shew you, lilies none,
None in Caesar's gardens blow,&#151;
And a quince in hand,&#151;not one
Is set upon your boughs below;        10
Not set, because their buds not spring;
Spring not, 'cause world is wintering.
 

But these were found in the East and South
Where Winter is the clime forgot.&#151;
The dewdrop on the larkspur's mouth        15
O should it then be quench&grave;d not?
In starry water-meads they drew
These drops: which be they? stars or dew?
 

Had she a quince in hand? Yet gaze:
Rather it is the sizing moon.        20
Lo, link&egrave;d heavens with milky ways!
That was her larkspur row.&#151;So soon?
Sphered so fast, sweet soul?&#151;We see
Nor fruit, nor flowers, nor Dorothy.

10.  The Lantern out of Doors
  









 
SOMETIMES a lantern moves along the night,
  That interests our eyes. And who goes there?
  I think; where from and bound, I wonder, where,
With, all down darkness wide, his wading light?
 

Men go by me whom either beauty bright        5
  In mould or mind or what not else makes rare:
  They rain against our much-thick and marsh air
Rich beams, till death or distance buys them quite.
 

Death or distance soon consumes them: wind
  What most I may eye after, be in at the end        10
I cannot, and out of sight is out of mind.
 

Christ minds: Christ's interest, what to avow or amend
  There, &eacute;yes them, heart w&aacute;nts, care ha&uacute;nts, foot f&oacute;llows k&iacute;nd,
Their r&aacute;nsom, th&eacute;ir rescue, &aacute;nd first, f&aacute;st, last fri&eacute;nd.

11.  The Sea and the Skylark
  









 
ON ear and ear two noises too old to end
  Trench&#151;right, the tide that ramps against the shore;
  With a flood or a fall, low lull-off or all roar,
Frequenting there while moon shall wear and wend.
 

Left hand, off land, I hear the lark ascend,        5
  His rash-fresh re-winded new-skein&egrave;d score
  In crisps of curl off wild winch whirl, and pour
And pelt music, till none 's to spill nor spend.
 

How these two shame this shallow and frail town!
  How ring right out our sordid turbid time,        10
Being pure! We, life's pride and cared-for crown,
 

  Have lost that cheer and charm of earth's past prime:
Our make and making break, are breaking, down
  To man's last dust, drain fast towards man's first slime.

12.  The Windhover
   To Christ our Lord
 









 
I CAUGHT this morning morning's minion, king-
  dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding
  Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding
High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing
In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,        5
  As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding
  Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding
Stirred for a bird,&#151;the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!
 

Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here
  Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion        10
Times told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!
 

  No wonder of it: sh&eacute;er pl&oacute;d makes plough down sillion
Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,
  Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.

13.  Pied Beauty
  









 
GLORY be to God for dappled things&#151;
  For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;
    For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;
Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings;
  Landscape plotted and pieced&#151;fold, fallow, and plough;        5
    And &aacute;ll tr&aacute;des, their gear and tackle and trim.
 

All things counter, original, spare, strange;
  Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)
    With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;
He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:        10
                  Praise him.

14.  Hurrahing in Harvest
  









 
SUMMER ends now; now, barbarous in beauty, the stooks arise
  Around; up above, what wind-walks! what lovely behaviour
  Of silk-sack clouds! has wilder, wilful-wavier
Meal-drift moulded ever and melted across skies?
 

I walk, I lift up, I lift up heart, eyes,        5
  Down all that glory in the heavens to glean our Saviour;
  And, &eacute;yes, he&aacute;rt, what looks, what lips yet gave you a
Rapturous love's greeting of realer, of rounder replies?
 

And the azurous hung hills are his world-wielding shoulder
  Majestic&#151;as a stallion stalwart, very-violet-sweet!&#151;        10
These things, these things were here and but the beholder
  Wanting; which two when they once meet,
The heart rears wings bold and bolder
  And hurls for him, O half hurls earth for him off under his feet.

15.  The Caged Skylark
  









 
AS a dare-gale skylark scanted in a dull cage
  Man's mounting spirit in his bone-house, mean house, dwells&#151;
  That bird beyond the remembering his free fells;
This in drudgery, day-labouring-out life's age.
 

Though aloft on turf or perch or poor low stage,        5
  Both sing somet&iacute;mes the sweetest, sweetest spells,
  Yet both droop deadly s&oacute;metimes in their cells
Or wring their barriers in bursts of fear or rage.
 

Not that the sweet-fowl, song-fowl, needs no rest&#151;
Why, hear him, hear him babble and drop down to his nest,        10
   But his own nest, wild nest, no prison.
 

Man's spirit will be flesh-bound when found at best,
But uncumbered: meadow-down is not distressed
  For a rainbow footing it nor he for his b&oacute;nes r&iacute;sen.

16.  In the Valley of the Elwy
  









 
I REMEMBER a house where all were good
  To me, God knows, deserving no such thing:
  Comforting smell breathed at very entering,
Fetched fresh, as I suppose, off some sweet wood.
That cordial air made those kind people a hood        5
  All over, as a bevy of eggs the mothering wing
  Will, or mild nights the new morsels of spring:
Why, it seemed of course; seemed of right it should.
 

Lovely the woods, waters, meadows, combes, vales,
All the air things wear that build this world of Wales;        10
  Only the inmate does not correspond:
God, lover of souls, swaying considerate scales,
Complete thy creature dear O where it fails,
  Being mighty a master, being a father and fond.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
17.  The Loss of the Eurydice
   Foundered March 24. 1878
 









 
1THE Eurydice&#151;it concerned thee, O Lord:
Three hundred souls, O alas! on board,
    Some asleep unawakened, all un-
warned, eleven fathoms fallen
 

2Where she foundered! One stroke        5
Felled and furled them, the hearts of oak!
    And flockbells off the aerial
Downs' forefalls beat to the burial.
 

3For did she pride her, freighted fully, on
Bounden bales or a hoard of bullion?&#151;        10
    Precious passing measure,
Lads and men her lade and treasure.
 

4She had come from a cruise, training seamen&#151;
Men, boldboys soon to be men:
    Must it, worst weather,        15
Blast bole and bloom together?
 

5No Atlantic squall overwrought her
Or rearing billow of the Biscay water:
    Home was hard at hand
And the blow bore from land.        20
 

6And you were a liar, O blue March day.
Bright sun lanced fire in the heavenly bay;
    But what black Boreas wrecked her? he
Came equipped, deadly-electric,
 

7A beetling baldbright cloud thorough England        25
Riding: there did stores not mingle? and
    Hailropes hustle and grind their
Heavengravel? wolfsnow, worlds of it, wind there?
 

8Now Carisbrook keep goes under in gloom;
Now it overvaults Appledurcombe;        30
    Now near by Ventnor town
It hurls, hurls off Boniface Down.
 

9Too proud, too proud, what a press she bore!
Royal, and all her royals wore.
    Sharp with her, shorten sail!        35
Too late; lost; gone with the gale.
 

10This was that fell capsize,
As half she had righted and hoped to rise
    Death teeming in by her portholes
Raced down decks, round messes of mortals.        40
 

11Then a lurch forward, frigate and men;
&#145;All hands for themselves' the cry ran then;
    But she who had housed them thither
Was around them, bound them or wound them with her.
 

12Marcus Hare, high her captain,        45
Kept to her&#151;care-drowned and wrapped in
    Cheer's death, would follow
His charge through the champ-white water-in-a-wallow,
 

13All under Channel to bury in a beach her
Cheeks: Right, rude of feature,        50
    He thought he heard say
&#145;Her commander! and thou too, and thou this way.'
 

14It is even seen, time's something server,
In mankind's medley a duty-swerver,
    At downright &#145;No or yes?'        55
Doffs all, drives full for righteousness.
 

15Sydney Fletcher, Bristol-bred,
(Low lie his mates now on watery bed)
    Takes to the seas and snows
As sheer down the ship goes.        60
 

16Now her afterdraught gullies him too down;
Now he wrings for breath with the deathgush brown;
    Till a lifebelt and God's will
Lend him a lift from the sea-swill.
 

17Now he shoots short up to the round air;        65
Now he gasps, now he gazes everywhere;
    But his eye no cliff, no coast or
Mark makes in the rivelling snowstorm.
 

18Him, after an hour of wintry waves,
A schooner sights, with another, and saves,        70
    And he boards her in Oh! such joy
He has lost count what came next, poor boy.&#151;
 

19They say who saw one sea-corpse cold
He was all of lovely manly mould,
    Every inch a tar,        75
Of the best we boast our sailors are.
 

20Look, foot to forelock, how all things suit! he
Is strung by duty, is strained to beauty,
    And brown-as-dawning-skinned
With brine and shine and whirling wind.        80
 

21O his nimble finger, his gnarled grip!
Leagues, leagues of seamanship
    Slumber in these forsaken
Bones, this sinew, and will not waken.
 

22He was but one like thousands more,        85
Day and night I deplore
    My people and born own nation,
Fast foundering own generation.
 

23I might let bygones be&#151;our curse
Of ruinous shrine no hand or, worse,        90
    Robbery's hand is busy to
Dress, hoar-hallow&egrave;d shrines unvisited;
 

24Only the breathing temple and fleet
Life, this wildworth blown so sweet,
    These daredeaths, ay this crew, in        95
Unchrist, all rolled in ruin&#151;
 

25Deeply surely I need to deplore it,
Wondering why my master bore it,
    The riving off that race
So at home, time was, to his truth and grace        100
 

26That a starlight-wender of ours would say
The marvellous Milk was Walsingham Way
    And one&#151;but let be, let be:
More, more than was will yet be.&#151;
 

27O well wept, mother have lost son;        105
Wept, wife; wept, sweetheart would be one:
    Though grief yield them no good
Yet shed what tears sad truelove should.
 

28But to Christ lord of thunder
Crouch; lay knee by earth low under:        110
    &#145;Holiest, loveliest, bravest,
Save my hero, O Hero savest.
 

29And the prayer thou hearst me making
Have, at the awful overtaking,
    Heard; have heard and granted        115
Grace that day grace was wanted.'
 

30Not that hell knows redeeming,
But for souls sunk in seeming
    Fresh, till doomfire burn all,
Prayer shall fetch pity eternal.        120

18.  The May Magnificat
  









 
MAY is Mary's month, and I
Muse at that and wonder why:
    Her feasts follow reason,
    Dated due to season&#151;
 

Candlemas, Lady Day;        5
But the Lady Month, May,
    Why fasten that upon her,
    With a feasting in her honour?
 

Is it only its being brighter
Than the most are must delight her?        10
    Is it opportunest
    And flowers finds soonest?
 

Ask of her, the mighty mother:
Her reply puts this other
    Question: What is Spring?&#151;        15
    Growth in every thing&#151;
 

Flesh and fleece, fur and feather,
Grass and greenworld all together;
    Star-eyed strawberry-breasted
    Throstle above her nested        20
 

Cluster of bugle blue eggs thin
Forms and warms the life within;
    And bird and blossom swell
    In sod or sheath or shell.
 

All things rising, all things sizing        25
Mary sees, sympathising
    With that world of good,
    Nature's motherhood.
 

Their magnifying of each its kind
With delight calls to mind        30
    How she did in her stored
    Magnify the Lord.
 

Well but there was more than this:
Spring's universal bliss
    Much, had much to say        35
    To offering Mary May.
 

When drop-of-blood-and-foam-dapple
Bloom lights the orchard-apple
    And thicket and thorp are merry
    With silver-surf&egrave;d cherry        40
 

And azuring-over greybell makes
Wood banks and brakes wash wet like lakes
    And magic cuckoocall
    Caps, clears, and clinches all&#151;
 

This ecstasy all through mothering earth        45
Tells Mary her mirth till Christ's birth
    To remember and exultation
    In God who was her salvation.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
19.  Binsey Poplars
   felled 1879
 









 
  MY aspens dear, whose airy cages quelled,
  Quelled or quenched in leaves the leaping sun,
  All felled, felled, are all felled;
    Of a fresh and following folded rank
            Not spared, not one        5
            That dandled a sandalled
        Shadow that swam or sank
On meadow and river and wind-wandering weed-winding bank.
 

  O if we but knew what we do
        When we delve or hew&#151;        10
    Hack and rack the growing green!
        Since country is so tender
    To touch, her being s&oacute; slender,
    That, like this sleek and seeing ball
    But a prick will make no eye at all,        15
    Where we, even where we mean
            To mend her we end her,
        When we hew or delve:
After-comers cannot guess the beauty been.
  Ten or twelve, only ten or twelve        20
    Strokes of havoc &uacute;nselve
        The sweet especial scene,
    Rural scene, a rural scene,
    Sweet especial rural scene.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
2.  Heaven&#151;Haven
   A nun takes the veil
 









 
    I HAVE desired to go
      Where springs not fail,
To fields where flies no sharp and sided hail
    And a few lilies blow.
 

    And I have asked to be        5
      Where no storms come,
Where the green swell is in the havens dumb,
    And out of the swing of the sea.

20.  Duns Scotus's Oxford
  









 
TOWERY city and branchy between towers;
Cuckoo-echoing, bell-swarm&egrave;d, lark-charm&egrave;d, rook-racked, river-rounded;
The dapple-eared lily below thee; that country and town did
Once encounter in, here coped and pois&egrave;d powers;
 

Thou hast a base and brickish skirt there, sours        5
That neighbour-nature thy grey beauty is grounded
Best in; graceless growth, thou hast confounded
Rural rural keeping&#151;folk, flocks, and flowers.
 

Yet ah! this air I gather and I release
He lived on; these weeds and waters, these walls are what        10
He haunted who of all men most sways my spirits to peace;
 

Of realty the rarest-vein&egrave;d unraveller; a not
Rivalled insight, be rival Italy or Greece;
Who fired France for Mary without spot.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
21.  Henry Purcell
     The poet wishes well to the divine genius of Purcell and praises him that, whereas other musicians have given utterance to the moods of man's mind, he has, beyond that, uttered in notes the very make and species of man as created both in him and in all men generally.
 









 
HAVE, fair fallen, O fair, fair have fallen, so dear
To me, so arch-especial a spirit as heaves in Henry Purcell,
An age is now since passed, since parted; with the reversal
Of the outward sentence low lays him, listed to a heresy, here.
 

Not mood in him nor meaning, proud fire or sacred fear,        5
Or love or pity or all that sweet notes not his might nursle:
It is the forg&egrave;d feature finds me; it is the rehearsal
Of own, of abrupt self there so thrusts on, so throngs the ear.
 

Let him Oh! with his air of angels then lift me, lay me! only I'll
Have an eye to the sakes of him, quaint moonmarks, to his pelted plumage under        10
Wings: so some great stormfowl, whenever he has walked his while
 

The thunder-purple seabeach plum&egrave;d purple-of-thunder,
If a wuthering of his palmy snow-pinions scatter a colossal smile
Off him, but meaning motion fans fresh our wits with wonder.

22.  Peace
  









 
WHEN will you ever, Peace, wild wooddove, shy wings shut,
Your round me roaming end, and under be my boughs?
When, when, Peace, will you, Peace? I'll not play hypocrite
To own my heart: I yield you do come sometimes; but
That piecemeal peace is poor peace. What pure peace allows        5
Alarms of wars, the daunting wars, the death of it?
 

O surely, reaving Peace, my Lord should leave in lieu
Some good! And so he does leave Patience exquisite,
That plumes to Peace thereafter. And when Peace here does house
He comes with work to do, he does not come to coo,        10
        He comes to brood and sit.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
23.  The Bugler's First Communion
  









 
A BUGLAR boy from barrack (it is over the hill
There)&#151;boy bugler, born, he tells me, of Irish
        Mother to an English sire (he
Shares their best gifts surely, fall how things will),
 

This very very day came down to us after a boon he on        5
My late being there begged of me, overflowing
        Boon in my bestowing,
Came, I say, this day to it&#151;to a First Communion.
 

Here he knelt then &iacute;n regimental red.
Forth Christ from cupboard fetched, how fain I of feet        10
        To his youngster take his treat!
Low-latched in leaf-light housel his too huge godhead.
 

There! and your sweetest sendings, ah divine,
By it, heavens, befall him! as a heart Christ's darling, dauntless;
        Tongue true, vaunt- and tauntless;        15
Breathing bloom of a chastity in mansex fine.
 

Frowning and forefending angel-warder
Squander the hell-rook ranks sally to molest him;
        March, kind comrade, abreast him;
Dress his days to a dexterous and starlight order.        20
 

How it d&oacute;es my heart good, visiting at that bleak hill,
When limber liquid youth, that to all I teach
        Yields tender as a pushed peach,
Hies headstrong to its wellbeing of a self-wise self-will!
 

Then though I should tread tufts of consolation        25
D&aacute;ys &aacute;fter, s&oacute; I in a sort deserve to
        And do serve God to serve to
Just such slips of soldiery Christ's royal ration.
 

Nothing &eacute;lse is like it, no, not all so strains
Us: fresh youth fretted in a bloomfall all portending        30
        That sweet's sweeter ending;
Realm both Christ is heir to and th&eacute;re r&eacute;igns.
 

O now well work that sealing sacred ointment!
O for now charms, arms, what bans off bad
        And locks love ever in a lad!        35
Let m&eacute; though see no more of him, and not disappointment
 

Those sweet hopes quell whose least me quickenings lift,
In scarlet or somewhere of some day seeing
        That brow and bead of being,
An our day's God's own Galahad. Though this child's drift        40
 

Seems by a div&iacute;ne doom ch&aacute;nnelled, nor do I cry
Disaster there; but may he not rankle and roam
        In backwheels though bound home?&#151;
That left to the Lord of the Eucharist, I here lie by;
 

Recorded only, I have put my lips on pleas        45
Would brandle adamantine heaven with ride and jar, did
        Prayer go disregarded:
Forward-like, but however, and like favourable heaven heard these.

24.  Morning Midday and Evening Sacrifice
  









 
THE DAPPLED die-away
Cheek and wimpled lip,
The gold-wisp, the airy-grey
Eye, all in fellowship&#151;
This, all this beauty blooming,        5
This, all this freshness fuming,
Give God while worth consuming.
 

Both thought and thew now bolder
And told by Nature: Tower;
Head, heart, hand, heel, and shoulder        10
That beat and breathe in power&#151;
This pride of prime's enjoyment
Take as for tool, not toy meant
And hold at Christ's employment.
 

The vault and scope and schooling        15
And mastery in the mind,
In silk-ash kept from cooling,
And ripest under rind&#151;
What life half lifts the latch of,
What hell stalks towards the snatch of,        20
Your offering, with despatch, of!

25.  Andromeda
  









 
NOW Time's Andromeda on this rock rude,
With not her either beauty's equal or
Her injury's, looks off by both horns of shore,
Her flower, her piece of being, doomed dragon's food.
  Time past she has been attempted and pursued        5
By many blows and banes; but now hears roar
A wilder beast from West than all were, more
Rife in her wrongs, more lawless, and more lewd.
 

  Her Perseus linger and leave her t&oacute; her extremes?&#151;
Pillowy air he treads a time and hangs        10
His thoughts on her, forsaken that she seems,
  All while her patience, morselled into pangs,
Mounts; then to alight disarming, no one dreams,
With Gorgon's gear and barebill, thongs and fangs.


 See Notes.

26.  The Candle Indoors
  









 
SOME candle clear burns somewhere I come by.
I muse at how its being puts blissful back
With yellowy moisture mild night's blear-all black,
Or to-fro tender trambeams truckle at the eye.
By that window what task what fingers ply,        5
I plod wondering, a-wanting, just for lack
Of answer the eagerer a-wanting Jessy or Jack
There  God to aggr&aacute;ndise, God to glorify.&#151;
 

Come you indoors, come home; your fading fire
Mend first and vital candle in close heart's vault:        10
You there are master, do your own desire;
What hinders? Are you beam-blind, yet to a fault
In a neighbour deft-handed? Are you that liar
And, cast by conscience out, spendsavour salt?

27.  The Handsome Heart
   at a Gracious Answer
 









 
&#145;BUT tell me, child, your choice; what shall I buy
You?'&#151;&#145;Father, what you buy me I like best.'
With the sweetest air that said, still plied and pressed,
He swung to his first poised purport of reply.
 

What the heart is! which, like carriers let fly&#151;        5
Doff darkness, homing nature knows the rest&#151;
To its own fine function, wild and self-instressed,
Falls light as ten years long taught how to and why.
 

Mannerly-hearted! more than handsome face&#151;
Beauty's bearing or muse of mounting vein,        10
All, in this case, bathed in high hallowing grace&#133;
 

Of heaven what boon to buy you, boy, or gain
Not granted?&#151;Only &#133; O on that path you pace
Run all your race, O brace sterner that strain!

28.  At the Wedding March
  









 
GOD with honour hang your head,
Groom, and grace you, bride, your bed
With lissome scions, sweet scions,
Out of hallowed bodies bred.
 

Each be other's comfort kind:        5
D&eacute;ep, d&eacute;eper than divined,
Divine charity, dear charity,
Fast you ever, fast bind.
 

Then let the March tread our ears:
I to him turn with tears        10
Who to wedlock, his wonder wedlock,
D&eacute;als tr&iacute;umph and immortal years.

29.  Felix Randal
  









 
FELIX RANDAL the farrier, O he is dead then? my duty all ended,
Who have watched his mould of man, big-boned and hardy-handsome
Pining, pining, till time when reason rambled in it and some
Fatal four disorders, fleshed there, all contended?
 

Sickness broke him. Impatient he cursed at first, but mended        5
Being anointed and all; though a heavenlier heart began some
Months earlier, since I had our sweet reprieve and ransom
Tendered to him. Ah well, God rest him all road ever he offended!
 

This seeing the sick endears them to us, us too it endears.
My tongue had taught thee comfort, touch had quenched thy tears,        10
Thy tears that touched my heart, child, Felix, poor Felix Randal;
 

How far from then forethought of, all thy more boisterous years,
When thou at the random grim forge, powerful amidst peers,
Didst fettle for the great grey drayhorse his bright and battering sandal!

3.  The Habit of Perfection
  









 
ELECTED Silence, sing to me
And beat upon my whorl&egrave;d ear,
Pipe me to pastures still and be
The music that I care to hear.
 

Shape nothing, lips; be lovely-dumb:        5
It is the shut, the curfew sent
From there where all surrenders come
Which only makes you eloquent.
 

Be shell&egrave;d, eyes, with double dark
And find the uncreated light:        10
This ruck and reel which you remark
Coils, keeps, and teases simple sight.
 

Palate, the hutch of tasty lust,
Desire not to be rinsed with wine:
The can must be so sweet, the crust        15
So fresh that come in fasts divine!
 

Nostrils, your careless breath that spend
Upon the stir and keep of pride,
What relish shall the censers send
Along the sanctuary side!        20
 

O feel-of-primrose hands, O feet
That want the yield of plushy sward,
But you shall walk the golden street
And you unhouse and house the Lord.
 

And, Poverty, be thou the bride        25
And now the marriage feast begun,
And lily-coloured clothes provide
Your spouse not laboured-at nor spun.

30.  Brothers
  









 
HOW lovely the elder brother's
Life all laced in the other's,
L&oacute;ve-laced!&#151;what once I well
Witnessed; so fortune fell.
When Shrovetide, two years gone,        5
Our boys' plays brought on
Part was picked for John,
Young J&oacute;hn: then fear, then joy
Ran revel in the elder boy.
Their night was come now; all        10
Our company thronged the hall;
Henry, by the wall,
Beckoned me beside him:
I came where called, and eyed him
By meanwhiles; making my play        15
Turn most on tender byplay.
For, wrung all on love's rack,
My lad, and lost in Jack,
Smiled, blushed, and bit his lip;
Or drove, with a diver's dip,        20
Clutched hands down through clasped knees&#151;
Truth's tokens tricks like these,
Old telltales, with what stress
He hung on the imp's success.
Now the other was br&aacute;ss-b&oacute;ld:        25
H&eacute; had no work to hold
His heart up at the strain;
Nay, roguish ran the vein.
Two tedious acts were past;
Jack's call and cue at last;        30
When Henry, heart-forsook,
Dropped eyes and dared not look.
Eh, how &aacute;ll r&uacute;ng!
Young dog, he did give tongue!
But Harry&#151;in his hands he has flung        35
His tear-tricked cheeks of flame
For fond love and for shame.
  Ah Nature, framed in fault,
There 's comfort then, there 's salt;
Nature, bad, base, and blind,        40
Dearly thou canst be kind;
There dearly th&eacute;n, de&aacute;rly,
I'll cry thou canst be kind.

31.  Spring and Fall
   to a young child
 









 
M&Aacute;RGAR&Eacute;T, &aacute;re you gr&iacute;eving
Over Goldengrove unleaving?
Le&aacute;ves, l&iacute;ke the things of man, you
With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?
&Aacute;h! &aacute;s the heart grows older        5
It will come to such sights colder
By and by, nor spare a sigh
Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;
And yet you w&iacute;ll weep and know why.
Now no matter, child, the name:        10
S&oacute;rrow's spr&iacute;ngs &aacute;re the same.
Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed
What heart heard of, ghost guessed:
It &iacute;s the blight man was born for,
It is Margaret you mourn for.        15

32.  Spelt from Sibyl's Leaves
  









 
EARNEST, earthless, equal, attuneable, ' vaulty, voluminous, &#133; stupendous
Evening strains to be t&iacute;me's v&aacute;st, ' womb-of-all, home-of-all, hearse-of-all night.
Her fond yellow hornlight wound to the west, ' her wild hollow hoarlight hung to the height
Waste; her earliest stars, earl-stars, ' st&aacute;rs principal, overbend us,
F&iacute;re-f&eacute;aturing heaven. For earth ' her being has unbound, her dapple is at an end, as-        5
tray or aswarm, all throughther, in throngs; ' self &iacute;n self steed&egrave;d and p&aacute;shed&#151;q&uacute;ite
Disremembering, d&iacute;sm&eacute;mbering ' &aacute;ll now. Heart, you round me right
With: &Oacute;ur &eacute;vening is over us; &oacute;ur night ' wh&eacute;lms, wh&eacute;lms, &aacute;nd will end us.
Only the beak-leaved boughs dragonish ' damask the tool-smooth bleak light; black,
Ever so black on it. &Oacute;ur tale, O &oacute;ur oracle! ' L&eacute;t life, w&aacute;ned, ah l&eacute;t life wind        10
Off h&eacute;r once sk&eacute;ined stained v&eacute;ined variety ' upon, &aacute;ll on tw&oacute; spools; p&aacute;rt, pen, p&aacute;ck
Now her &aacute;ll in tw&oacute; flocks, tw&oacute; folds&#151;black, white; ' right, wrong; reckon but, reck but, mind
But th&eacute;se two; w&aacute;re of a w&oacute;rld where b&uacute;t these ' tw&oacute; tell, each off the &oacute;ther; of a rack
Where, selfwrung, selfstrung, sheathe- and shelterless, ' th&oacute;ughts aga&iacute;nst thoughts &iacute;n groans gr&iacute;nd.

33.  Inversnaid
  









 
THIS darksome burn, horseback brown,
His rollrock highroad roaring down,
In coop and in comb the fleece of his foam
Flutes and low to the lake falls home.
 

A windpuff-bonnet of f&aacute;wn-fr&oacute;th        5
Turns and twindles over the broth
Of a pool so pitchblack, f&eacute;ll-fr&oacute;wning,
It rounds and rounds Despair to drowning.
 

Degged with dew, dappled with dew
Are the groins of the braes that the brook treads through,        10
Wiry heathpacks, flitches of fern,
And the beadbonny ash that sits over the burn.
 

What would the world be, once bereft
Of wet and of wildness? Let them be left,
O let them be left, wildness and wet;        15
Long live the weeds and the wilderness yet.

34.  &#145;As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies dr&aacute;w fl&aacute;me'
  









 
AS kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies dr&aacute;w fl&aacute;me;
As tumbled over rim in roundy wells
Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's
Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;
Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:        5
Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;
Selves&#151;goes itself; myself it speaks and spells,
Crying Wh&aacute;t I do is me: for that I came.
 

&Iacute; say m&oacute;re: the just man justices;
K&eacute;eps gr&aacute;ce: th&aacute;t keeps all his goings graces;        10
Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is&#151;
Chr&iacute;st&#151;for Christ plays in ten thousand places,
Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his
To the Father through the features of men's faces.

35.  Ribblesdale
  









 
EARTH, sweet Earth, sweet landscape, with leav&eacute;s throng
And louch&eacute;d low grass, heaven that dost appeal
To, with no tongue to plead, no heart to feel;
That canst but only be, but dost that long&#151;
 

Thou canst but be, but that thou well dost; strong        5
Thy plea with him who dealt, nay does now deal,
Thy lovely dale down thus and thus bids reel
Thy river, and o'er gives all to rack or wrong.
 

  And what is Earth's eye, tongue, or heart else, where
Else, but in dear and dogged man?&#151;Ah, the heir        10
To his own selfbent so bound, so tied to his turn,
To thriftless reave both our rich round world bare
And none reck of world after, this bids wear
Earth brows of such care, care and dear concern.

THE LEADEN ECHOHOW to k&eacute;ep&#151;is there &aacute;ny any, is there none such, nowhere known some, bow or brooch or braid or brace, l&aacute;ce, latch or catch or key to keep
Back beauty, keep it, beauty, beauty, beauty, &#133; from vanishing away?

D&oacute;wn? no waving off of these most mournful messengers, still messengers, sad and stealing messengers of grey?
No there 's none, there 's none, O no there 's none,        5
Nor can you long be, what you now are, called fair,
Do what you may do, what, do what you may,
And wisdom is early to despair:
Be beginning; since, no, nothing can be done
To keep at bay        10
Age and age's evils, hoar hair,
Ruck and wrinkle, drooping, dying, death's worst, winding sheets, tombs and worms and tumbling to decay;
So be beginning, be beginning to despair.
O there 's none; no no no there 's none:
Be beginning to despair, to despair,        15
Despair, despair, despair, despair.
 

THE GOLDEN ECHO        Spare!
There &iacute;s one, yes I have one (Hush there!);
Only not within seeing of the sun,
Not within the singeing of the strong sun,        20
Tall sun's tingeing, or treacherous the tainting of the earth's air,
Somewhere elsewhere there is ah well where! one,
On&eacute;. Yes I can tell such a key, I do know such a place,
Where whatever's prized and passes of us, everything that 's fresh and fast flying of us, seems to us sweet of us and swiftly away with, done away with, undone,
Undone, done with, soon done with, and yet dearly and dangerously sweet        25
Of us, the wimpled-water-dimpled, not-by-morning-match&egrave;d face,
The flower of beauty, fleece of beauty, too too apt to, ah! to fleet,
Never fleets m&oacute;re, fastened with the tenderest truth
To its own best being and its loveliness of youth: it is an everlastingness of, O it is an all youth!
Come then, your ways and airs and looks, locks, maiden gear, gallantry and gaiety and grace,        30
Winning ways, airs innocent, maiden manners, sweet looks, loose locks, long locks, lovelocks, gaygear, going gallant, girlgrace&#151;
Resign them, sign them, seal them, send them, motion them with breath,
And with sighs soaring, soaring s&iacute;ghs deliver
Them; beauty-in-the-ghost, deliver it, early now, long before death
Give beauty back, beauty, beauty, beauty, back to God, beauty's self and beauty's giver.        35
See; not a hair is, not an eyelash, not the least lash lost; every hair
Is, hair of the head, numbered.
Nay, what we had lighthanded left in surly the mere mould
Will have waked and have waxed and have walked with the wind what while we slept,
This side, that side hurling a heavyheaded hundredfold        40
What while we, while we slumbered.
O then, weary then why
When the thing we freely f&oacute;rfeit is kept with fonder a care,
Fonder a care kept than we could have kept it, kept
Far with fonder a care (and we, we should have lost it) finer, fonder        45
A care kept.&#151;Where kept? Do but tell us where kept, where.&#151;
Yonder.&#151;What high as that! We follow, now we follow.&#151;Yonder, yes yonder, yonder,
Yonder.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
37.  The Blessed Virgin compared to the Air we Breathe
  









 
WILD air, world-mothering air,
Nestling me everywhere,
That each eyelash or hair
Girdles; goes home betwixt
The fleeciest, frailest-flixed        5
Snowflake; that 's fairly mixed
With, riddles, and is rife
In every least thing's life;
This needful, never spent,
And nursing element;        10
My more than meat and drink,
My meal at every wink;
This air, which, by life's law,
My lung must draw and draw
Now but to breathe its praise,        15
Minds me in many ways
Of her who not only
Gave God's infinity
Dwindled to infancy
Welcome in womb and breast,        20
Birth, milk, and all the rest
But mothers each new grace
That does now reach our race&#151;
Mary Immaculate,
Merely a woman, yet        25
Whose presence, power is
Great as no goddess's
Was deem&egrave;d, dream&egrave;d; who
This one work has to do&#151;
Let all God's glory through,        30
God's glory which would go
Through her and from her flow
Off, and no way but so.
 

    I say that we are wound
With mercy round and round        35
As if with air: the same
Is Mary, more by name.
She, wild web, wondrous robe,
Mantles the guilty globe,
Since God has let dispense        40
Her prayers his providence:
Nay, more than almoner,
The sweet alms' self is her
And men are meant to share
Her life as life does air.        45
    If I have understood,
She holds high motherhood
Towards all our ghostly good
And plays in grace her part
About man's beating heart,        50
Laying, like air's fine flood,
The deathdance in his blood;
Yet no part but what will
Be Christ our Saviour still.
Of her flesh he took flesh:        55
He does take fresh and fresh,
Though much the mystery how,
Not flesh but spirit now
And makes, O marvellous!
New Nazareths in us,        60
Where she shall yet conceive
Him, morning, noon, and eve;
New Bethlems, and he born
There, evening, noon, and morn&#151;
Bethlem or Nazareth,        65
Men here may draw like breath
More Christ and baffle death;
Who, born so, comes to be
New self and nobler me
In each one and each one        70
More makes, when all is done,
Both God's and Mary's Son.
    Again, look overhead
How air is azur&egrave;d;
O how! nay do but stand        75
Where you can lift your hand
Skywards: rich, rich it laps
Round the four fingergaps.
Yet such a sapphire-shot,
Charged, steep&egrave;d sky will not        80
Stain light. Yea, mark you this:
It does no prejudice.
The glass-blue days are those
When every colour glows,
Each shape and shadow shows.        85
Blue be it: this blue heaven
The seven or seven times seven
Hued sunbeam will transmit
Perfect, not alter it.
Or if there does some soft,        90
On things aloof, aloft,
Bloom breathe, that one breath more
Earth is the fairer for.
Whereas did air not make
This bath of blue and slake        95
His fire, the sun would shake,
A blear and blinding ball
With blackness bound, and all
The thick stars round him roll
Flashing like flecks of coal,        100
Quartz-fret, or sparks of salt,
In grimy vasty vault.
    So God was god of old:
A mother came to mould
Those limbs like ours which are        105
What must make our daystar
Much dearer to mankind;
Whose glory bare would blind
Or less would win man's mind.
Through her we may see him        110
Made sweeter, not made dim,
And her hand leaves his light
Sifted to suit our sight.
    Be thou then, O thou dear
Mother, my atmosphere;        115
My happier world, wherein
To wend and meet no sin;
Above me, round me lie
Fronting my froward eye
With sweet and scarless sky;        120
Stir in my ears, speak there
Of God's love, O live air,
Of patience, penance, prayer:
World-mothering air, air wild,
Wound with thee, in thee isled,        125
Fold home, fast fold thy child.

38.  To what serves Mortal Beauty?
  









 
TO what serves mortal beauty ' &#151;dangerous; does set danc-
ing blood&#151;the O-seal-that-so ' feature, flung prouder form
Than Purcell tune lets tread to? ' See: it does this: keeps warm
Men's wits to the things that are; ' what good means&#151;where a glance
Master more may than gaze, ' gaze out of countenance.        5
Those lovely lads once, wet-fresh ' windfalls of war's storm,
How then should Gregory, a father, ' have glean&egrave;d else from swarm-
ed Rome? But God to a nation ' dealt that day's dear chance.
  To man, that needs would worship ' block or barren stone,
Our law says: Love what are ' love's worthiest, were all known;        10
World's loveliest&#151;men's selves. Self ' flashes off frame and face.
What do then? how meet beauty? ' Merely meet it; own,
Home at heart, heaven's sweet gift; ' then leave, let that alone.
Yea, wish that though, wish all, ' God's better beauty, grace.

39.  (The Soldier)
  









 
YES. Why do we &aacute;ll, seeing of a soldier, bless him? bless
Our redcoats, our tars? Both these being, the greater part,
But frail clay, nay but foul clay. Here it is: the heart,
Since, proud, it calls the calling manly, gives a guess
That, hopes that, makesbelieve, the men must be no less;        5
It fancies, feigns, deems, dears the artist after his art;
And fain will find as sterling all as all is smart,
And scarlet wear the spirit of w&aacute;r th&eacute;re express.
 

Mark Christ our King. He knows war, served this soldiering through;
He of all can handle a rope best. There he bides in bliss        10
Now, and s&eacute;eing somewh&eacute;re some m&aacute;n do all that man can do,
For love he leans forth, needs his neck must fall on, kiss,
And cry &#145;O Christ-done deed! So God-made-flesh does too:
Were I come o'er again' cries Christ &#145;it should be this'.

4.  The Wreck of the Deutschland
   To the happy memory of five Franciscan Nuns exiles by the Falk Laws drowned between midnight and morning of Dec. 7th. 1875
 









 
PART THE FIRST1                THOU mastering me
            God! giver of breath and bread;
        World's strand, sway of the sea;
            Lord of living and dead;
    Thou hast bound bones and veins in me, fastened me flesh,        5
    And after it almost unmade, what with dread,
        Thy doing: and dost thou touch me afresh?
Over again I feel thy finger and find thee.
 

2                I did say yes
            O at lightning and lashed rod;        10
        Thou heardst me truer than tongue confess
            Thy terror, O Christ, O God;
    Thou knowest the walls, altar and hour and night:
    The swoon of a heart that the sweep and the hurl of thee trod
        Hard down with a horror of height:        15
And the midriff astrain with leaning of, laced with fire of stress.
 

3                The frown of his face
            Before me, the hurtle of hell
        Behind, where, where was a, where was a place?
            I whirled out wings that spell        20
    And fled with a fling of the heart to the heart of the Host.
    My heart, but you were dovewinged, I can tell,
        Carrier-witted, I am bold to boast,
To flash from the flame to the flame then, tower from the grace to the grace.
 

4                I am soft sift        25
            In an hourglass&#151;at the wall
        Fast, but mined with a motion, a drift,
            And it crowds and it combs to the fall;
    I steady as a water in a well, to a poise, to a pane,
    But roped with, always, all the way down from the tall        30
        Fells or flanks of the voel, a vein
Of the gospel proffer, a pressure, a principle, Christ's gift.
 

5                I kiss my hand
            To the stars, lovely-asunder
        Starlight, wafting him out of it; and        35
            Glow, glory in thunder;
    Kiss my hand to the dappled-with-damson west:
    Since, tho' he is under the world's splendour and wonder,
        His mystery must be instressed, stressed;
For I greet him the days I meet him, and bless when I understand.        40
 

6                Not out of his bliss
            Springs the stress felt
        Nor first from heaven (and few know this)
            Swings the stroke dealt&#151;
    Stroke and a stress that stars and storms deliver,        45
    That guilt is hushed by, hearts are flushed by and melt&#151;
        But it rides time like riding a river
(And here the faithful waver, the faithless fable and miss).
 

7                It dates from day
            Of his going in Galilee;        50
        Warm-laid grave of a womb-life grey;
            Manger, maiden's knee;
    The dense and the driven Passion, and frightful sweat;
    Thence the discharge of it, there its swelling to be,
        Though felt before, though in high flood yet&#151;        55
What none would have known of it, only the heart, being hard at bay,
 

8                Is out with it! Oh,
            We lash with the best or worst
        Word last! How a lush-kept plush-capped sloe
            Will, mouthed to flesh-burst,        60
    Gush!&#151;flush the man, the being with it, sour or sweet,
    Brim, in a flash, full!&#151;Hither then, last or first,
        To hero of Calvary, Christ, 's feet&#151;
Never ask if meaning it, wanting it, warned of it&#151;men go.
 

9                Be adored among men,        65
            God, three-number&egrave;d form;
        Wring thy rebel, dogged in den,
            Man's malice, with wrecking and storm.
    Beyond saying sweet, past telling of tongue,
    Thou art lightning and love, I found it, a winter and warm;        70
        Father and fondler of heart thou hast wrung:
Hast thy dark descending and most art merciful then.
 

10                With an anvil-ding
            And with fire in him forge thy will
        Or rather, rather then, stealing as Spring        75
            Through him, melt him but master him still:
    Whether at once, as once at a crash Paul,
    Or as Austin, a lingering-out sweet skill,
        Make mercy in all of us, out of us all
Mastery, but be adored, but be adored King.        80
 

PART THE SECOND11            &#145;Some find me a sword; some
            The flange and the rail; flame,
        Fang, or flood' goes Death on drum,
            And storms bugle his fame.
    But w&eacute; dream we are rooted in earth&#151;Dust!        85
    Flesh falls within sight of us, we, though our flower the same,
        Wave with the meadow, forget that there must
The sour scythe cringe, and the blear share come.
 

12            On Saturday sailed from Bremen,
            American-outward-bound,        90
        Take settler and seamen, tell men with women,
            Two hundred souls in the round&#151;
    O Father, not under thy feathers nor ever as guessing
    The goal was a shoal, of a fourth the doom to be drowned;
        Yet did the dark side of the bay of thy blessing        95
Not vault them, the million of rounds of thy mercy not reeve even them in?
 

13            Into the snows she sweeps,
            Hurling the haven behind,
        The Deutschland, on Sunday; and so the sky keeps,
            For the infinite air is unkind,        100
    And the sea flint-flake, black-backed in the regular blow,
    Sitting Eastnortheast, in cursed quarter, the wind;
        Wiry and white-fiery and whirlwind-swivell&egrave;d snow
Spins to the widow-making unchilding unfathering deeps.
 

14            She drove in the dark to leeward,        105
            She struck&#151;not a reef or a rock
        But the combs of a smother of sand: night drew her
            Dead to the Kentish Knock;
    And she beat the bank down with her bows and the ride of her keel:
    The breakers rolled on her beam with ruinous shock;        110
        And canvas and compass, the whorl and the wheel
Idle for ever to waft her or wind her with, these she endured.
 

15            Hope had grown grey hairs,
            Hope had mourning on,
        Trenched with tears, carved with cares,        115
            Hope was twelve hours gone;
    And frightful a nightfall folded rueful a day
    Nor rescue, only rocket and lightship, shone,
        And lives at last were washing away:
To the shrouds they took,&#151;they shook in the hurling and horrible airs.        120
 

16            One stirred from the rigging to save
            The wild woman-kind below,
        With a rope's end round the man, handy and brave&#151;
            He was pitched to his death at a blow,
    For all his dreadnought breast and braids of thew:        125
    They could tell him for hours, dandled the to and fro
        Through the cobbled foam-fleece, what could he do
With the burl of the fountains of air, buck and the flood of the wave?
 

17            They fought with God's cold&#151;
            And they could not and fell to the deck        130
        (Crushed them) or water (and drowned them) or rolled
            With the sea-romp over the wreck.
    Night roared, with the heart-break hearing a heart-broke rabble,
    The woman's wailing, the crying of child without check&#151;
        Till a lioness arose breasting the babble,        135
A prophetess towered in the tumult, a virginal tongue told.
 

18            Ah, touched in your bower of bone
            Are you! turned for an exquisite smart,
        Have you! make words break from me here all alone,
            Do you!&#151;mother of being in me, heart.        140
    O unteachably after evil, but uttering truth,
    Why, tears! is it? tears; such a melting, a madrigal start!
        Never-eldering revel and river of youth,
What can it be, this glee? the good you have there of your own?
 

19            Sister, a sister calling        145
            A master, her master and mine!&#151;
        And the inboard seas run swirling and hawling;
            The rash smart sloggering brine
    Blinds her; but she that weather sees one thing, one;
    Has one fetch in her: she rears herself to divine        150
        Ears, and the call of the tall nun
To the men in the tops and the tackle rode over the storm's brawling. 
 

20            She was first of a five and came
            Of a coif&egrave;d sisterhood.
        (O Deutschland, double a desperate name!        155
            O world wide of its good!
    But Gertrude, lily, and Luther, are two of a town,
    Christ's lily and beast of the waste wood:
        From life's dawn it is drawn down,
Abel is Cain's brother and breasts they have sucked the same.)        160
 

21            Loathed for a love men knew in them,
            Banned by the land of their birth,
        Rhine refused them. Thames would ruin them;
            Surf, snow, river and earth
    Gnashed: but thou art above, thou Orion of light;        165
    Thy unchancelling poising palms were weighing the worth,
        Thou martyr-master: in thy sight
Storm flakes were scroll-leaved flowers, lily showers&#151;sweet heaven was astrew in them.
 

22            Five! the finding and sake
            And cipher of suffering Christ.        170
        Mark, the mark is of man's make
            And the word of it Sacrificed.
    But he scores it in scarlet himself on his own bespoken,
    Before-time-taken, dearest priz&egrave;d and priced&#151;
        Stigma, signal, cinquefoil token        175
For lettering of the lamb's fleece, ruddying of the rose-flake.
 

23            Joy fall to thee, father Francis,
            Drawn to the Life that died;
        With the gnarls of the nails in thee, niche of the lance, his
            Lovescape crucified        180
    And seal of his seraph-arrival! and these thy daughters
    And five-liv&egrave;d and leav&egrave;d favour and pride,
        Are sisterly sealed in wild waters,
To bathe in his fall-gold mercies, to breathe in his all-fire glances.
 

24            Away in the loveable west,        185
            On a pastoral forehead of Wales,
        I was under a roof here, I was at rest,
            And they the prey of the gales;
    She to the black-about air, to the breaker, the thickly
    Falling flakes, to the throng that catches and quails        190
        Was calling &#145;O Christ, Christ, come quickly':
The cross to her she calls Christ to her, christens her wild-worst Best.
 

25            The majesty! what did she mean?
            Breathe, arch and original Breath.
        Is it love in her of the being as her lover had been?        195
            Breathe, body of lovely Death.
    They were else-minded then, altogether, the men
    Woke thee with a we are perishing in the weather of Gennesareth.
        Or is it that she cried for the crown then,
The keener to come at the comfort for feeling the combating keen?        200
 

26            For how to the heart's cheering
            The down-dugged ground-hugged grey
        Hovers off, the jay-blue heavens appearing
            Of pied and peeled May!
    Blue-beating and hoary-glow height; or night, still higher,        205
    With belled fire and the moth-soft Milky Way,
        What by your measure is the heaven of desire,
The treasure never eyesight got, nor was ever guessed what for the hearing?
 

27            No, but it was not these.
            The jading and jar of the cart,        210
        Time's tasking, it is fathers that asking for ease
            Of the sodden-with-its-sorrowing heart,
    Not danger, electrical horror; then further it finds
    The appealing of the Passion is tenderer in prayer apart:
        Other, I gather, in measure her mind's        215
Burden, in wind's burly and beat of endragon&egrave;d seas.
 

28            But how shall I &#133; make me room there:
            Reach me a &#133; Fancy, come faster&#151;
        Strike you the sight of it? look at it loom there,
            Thing that she &#133; there then! the Master,        220
    Ipse, the only one, Christ, King, Head:
    He was to cure the extremity where he had cast her;
        Do, deal, lord it with living and dead;
Let him ride, her pride, in his triumph, despatch and have done with his doom there.
 

29            Ah! there was a heart right!        225
            There was single eye!
        Read the unshapeable shock night
            And knew the who and the why;
    Wording it how but by him that present and past,
    Heaven and earth are word of, worded by?&#151;        230
        The Simon Peter of a soul! to the blast
Tarpeian-fast, but a blown beacon of light.
 

30            Jesu, heart's light,
            Jesu, maid's son,
        What was the feast followed the night        235
            Thou hadst glory of this nun?&#151;
    Feast of the one woman without stain.
    For so conceiv&egrave;d, so to conceive thee is done;
        But here was heart-throe, birth of a brain,
Word, that heard and kept thee and uttered thee outright.        240
 

31            Well, she has thee for the pain, for the
            Patience; but pity of the rest of them!
        Heart, go and bleed at a bitterer vein for the
            Comfortless unconfessed of them&#151;
    No not uncomforted: lovely-felicitous Providence        245
    Finger of a tender of; O of a feathery delicacy, the breast of the
        Maiden could obey so, be a bell to, ring of it, and
Startle the poor sheep back! is the shipwrack then a harvest, does tempest carry the grain for thee?
 

32            I admire thee, master of the tides,
            Of the Yore-flood, of the year's fall;        250
        The recurb and the recovery of the gulf's sides,
            The girth of it and the wharf of it and the wall;
    Stanching, quenching ocean of a motionable mind;
    Ground of being, and granite of it: past all
        Grasp God, throned behind        255
Death with a sovereignty that heeds but hides, bodes but abides;
 

33            With a mercy that outrides
            The all of water, an ark
        For the listener; for the lingerer with a love glides
            Lower than death and the dark;        260
    A vein for the visiting of the past-prayer, pent in prison,
    The-last-breath penitent spirits&#151;the uttermost mark
        Our passion-plung&egrave;d giant risen,
The Christ of the Father compassionate, fetched in the storm of his strides.
 

34            Now burn, new born to the world,        265
            Doubled-natur&egrave;d name,
        The heaven-flung, heart-fleshed, maiden-furled
            Miracle-in-Mary-of-flame,
    Mid-numbered He in three of the thunder-throne!
    Not a dooms-day dazzle in his coming nor dark as he came;        270
        Kind, but royally reclaiming his own;
A released shower, let flash to the shire, not a lightning of fire hard-hurled.
 

35            Dame, at our door
            Drowned, and among our shoals,
        Remember us in the roads, the heaven-haven of the Reward:        275
            Our King back, oh, upon English souls!
    Let him easter in us, be a dayspring to the dimness of us, be a crimson-cresseted east,
    More brightening her, rare-dear Britain, as his reign rolls,
        Pride, rose, prince, hero of us, high-priest,
Our hearts' charity's hearth's fire, our thoughts' chivalry's throng's Lord.        280

40.  (Carrion Comfort)
  









 
NOT, I'll not, carrion comfort, Despair, not feast on thee;
Not untwist&#151;slack they may be&#151;these last strands of man
In me &oacute;r, most weary, cry I can no more. I can;
Can something, hope, wish day come, not choose not to be.
But ah, but O thou terrible, why wouldst thou rude on me        5
Thy wring-world right foot rock? lay a lionlimb against me? scan
With darksome devouring eyes my bruis&egrave;d bones? and fan,
O in turns of tempest, me heaped there; me frantic to avoid thee and flee?
 

  Why? That my chaff might fly; my grain lie, sheer and clear.
Nay in all that toil, that coil, since (seems) I kissed the rod,        10
Hand rather, my heart lo! lapped strength, stole joy, would laugh, ch&eacute;er.
Cheer whom though? the hero whose heaven-handling flung me, f&oacute;ot tr&oacute;d
Me? or me that fought him? O which one? is it each one? That night, that year
Of now done darkness I wretch lay wrestling with (my God!) my God.

41.  &#145;No worst, there is none. Pitched past pitch of grief'
  









 
NO worst, there is none. Pitched past pitch of grief,
More pangs will, schooled at forepangs, wilder wring.
Comforter, where, where is your comforting?
Mary, mother of us, where is your relief?
My cries heave, herds-long; huddle in a main, a chief        5
Woe, world-sorrow; on an age-old anvil wince and sing&#151;
Then lull, then leave off. Fury had shrieked &#145;No ling-
ering! Let me be fell: force I must be brief'.
 

  O the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall
Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed. Hold them cheap        10
May who ne'er hung there. Nor does long our small
Durance deal with that steep or deep. Here! creep,
Wretch, under a comfort serves in a whirlwind: all
Life death does end and each day dies with sleep.

Sure, 's bed now. Low be it: lustily he his low lot (feel        5

Thousands of thorns, thoughts) swings though. Commonweal

43.  Harry Ploughman
  









 
HARD as hurdle arms, with a broth of goldish flue
Breathed round; the rack of ribs; the scooped flank; lank
Rope-over thigh; knee-nave; and barrelled shank&#151;
        Head and foot, shoulder and shank&#151;
By a grey eye's heed steered well, one crew, fall to;        5
Stand at stress. Each limb's barrowy brawn, his thew
That onewhere curded, onewhere sucked or sank&#151;
            Soared or sank&#151;,
Though as a beechbole firm, finds his, as at a roll-call, rank
And features, in flesh, what deed he each must do&#151;        10
        His sinew-service where do.
 

He leans to it, Harry bends, look. Back, elbow, and liquid waist
In him, all quail to the wallowing o' the plough: 's cheek crimsons; curls
Wag or crossbridle, in a wind lifted, windlaced&#151;
        See his wind- lilylocks -laced;        15
Churlsgrace, too, child of Amansstrength, how it hangs or hurls
Them&#151;broad in bluff hide his frowning feet lashed! raced
With, along them, cragiron under and cold furls&#151;
        With-a-fountain's shining-shot furls.

44.  &#145;To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life'
  









 
TO seem the stranger lies my lot, my life
Among strangers. Father and mother dear,
Brothers and sisters are in Christ not near
And he my peace my parting, sword and strife.
  England, whose honour O all my heart woos, wife        5
To my creating thought, would neither hear
Me, were I pleading, plead nor do I: I wear-
y of idle a being but by where wars are rife.
 

  I am in Ireland now; now I am at a th&iacute;rd
Remove. Not but in all removes I can        10
Kind love both give and get. Only what word
Wisest my heart breeds dark heaven's baffling ban
Bars or hell's spell thwarts. This to hoard unheard,
Heard unheeded, leaves me a lonely began.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
45.  &#145;I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day'
  









 
I WAKE and feel the fell of dark, not day.
What hours, O what black ho&uuml;rs we have spent
This night! what sights you, heart, saw; ways you went!
And more must, in yet longer light's delay.
    With witness I speak this. But where I say        5
Hours I mean years, mean life. And my lament
Is cries countless, cries like dead letters sent
To dearest him that lives alas! away.
 

  I am gall, I am heartburn. God's most deep decree
Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me;        10
Bones built in me, flesh filled, blood brimmed the curse.
  Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours. I see
The lost are like this, and their scourge to be
As I am mine, their sweating selves; but worse.

46.  &#145;Patience, hard thing! the hard thing but to pray'
  









 
PATIENCE, hard thing! the hard thing but to pray,
But bid for, Patience is! Patience who asks
Wants war, wants wounds; weary his times, his tasks;
To do without, take tosses, and obey.
  Rare patience roots in these, and, these away,        5
Nowhere. Natural heart's ivy, Patience masks
Our ruins of wrecked past purpose. There she basks
Purple eyes and seas of liquid leaves all day.
 

  We hear our hearts grate on themselves: it kills
To bruise them dearer. Yet the rebellious wills        10
Of us we do bid God bend to him even so.
  And where is he who more and more distils
Delicious kindness?&#151;He is patient. Patience fills
His crisp combs, and that comes those ways we know.

47.  &#145;My own heart let me have more have pity on; let'
  









 
MY own heart let me have more have pity on; let
Me live to my sad self hereafter kind,
Charitable; not live this tormented mind
With this tormented mind tormenting yet.
  I cast for comfort I can no more get        5
By groping round my comfortless, than blind
Eyes in their dark can day or thirst can find
Thirst 's all-in-all in all a world of wet.
 

Soul, self; come, poor Jackself, I do advise
You, jaded, let be; call off thoughts awhile        10
Elsewhere; leave comfort root-room; let joy size
At God knows when to God knows what; whose smile
's not wrung, see you; unforeseen times rather&#151;as skies
Betweenpie mountains&#151;lights a lovely mile.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
48.  That Nature is a Heraclitean Fire and of the comfort of the Resurrection
  









 
CLOUD-PUFFBALL, torn tufts, tossed pillows ' flaunt forth, then chevy on an air-
built thoroughfare: heaven-roysterers, in gay-gangs ' they throng; they glitter in marches.
Down roughcast, down dazzling whitewash, ' wherever an elm arches,
Shivelights and shadowtackle in long ' lashes lace, lance, and pair.
Delightfully the bright wind boisterous ' ropes, wrestles, beats earth bare        5
Of yestertempest's creases; in pool and rut peel parches
Squandering ooze to squeezed ' dough, crust, dust; stanches, starches
Squadroned masks and manmarks ' treadmire toil there
Footfretted in it. Million-fuel&egrave;d, ' nature's bonfire burns on.
But quench her bonniest, dearest ' to her, her clearest-selv&egrave;d spark        10
Man, how fast his firedint, ' his mark on mind, is gone!
Both are in an unfathomable, all is in an enormous dark
Drowned. O pity and indig ' nation! Manshape, that shone
Sheer off, disseveral, a star, ' death blots black out; nor mark
                Is any of him at all so stark        15
But vastness blurs and time ' beats level. Enough! the Resurrection,
A heart's-clarion! Away grief's gasping, ' joyless days, dejection.
                Across my foundering deck shone
A beacon, an eternal beam. ' Flesh fade, and mortal trash
Fall to the residuary worm; ' world's wildfire, leave but ash:        20
                In a flash, at a trumpet crash,
I am all at once what Christ is, ' since he was what I am, and
This Jack, joke, poor potsherd, ' patch, matchwood, immortal diamond,
                Is immortal diamond.

49.  St. Alphonsus Rodriguez
   Laybrother of the Society of Jesus
 









 
HONOUR is flashed off exploit, so we say;
And those strokes once that gashed flesh or galled shield
Should tongue that time now, trumpet now that field,
And, on the fighter, forge his glorious day.
On Christ they do and on the martyr may;        5
But be the war within, the brand we wield
Unseen, the heroic breast not outward-steeled,
Earth hears no hurtle then from fiercest fray.
 

  Yet God (that hews mountain and continent,
Earth, all, out; who, with trickling increment,        10
Veins violets and tall trees makes more and more)
Could crowd career with conquest while there went
Those years and years by of world without event
That in Majorca Alfonso watched the door.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
5.  Penmaen Pool
   For the Visitors' Book at the Inn
 









 
WHO long for rest, who look for pleasure
Away from counter, court, or school
O where live well your lease of leisure
But here at, here at Penmaen Pool?
 

You'll dare the Alp? you'll dart the skiff?&#151;        5
Each sport has here its tackle and tool:
Come, plant the staff by Cadair cliff;
Come, swing the sculls on Penmaen Pool.
 

What's yonder?&#151;Grizzled Dyphwys dim:
The triple-hummocked Giant's stool,        10
Hoar messmate, hobs and nobs with him
To halve the bowl of Penmaen Pool.
 

And all the landscape under survey,
At tranquil turns, by nature's rule,
Rides repeated topsyturvy        15
In frank, in fairy Penmaen Pool.
 

And Charles's Wain, the wondrous seven,
And sheep-flock clouds like worlds of wool,
For all they shine so, high in heaven,
Shew brighter shaken in Penmaen Pool.        20
 

The Mawddach, how she trips! though throttled
If floodtide teeming thrills her full,
And mazy sands all water-wattled
Waylay her at ebb, past Penmaen Pool.
 

But what's to see in stormy weather,        25
When grey showers gather and gusts are cool?&#151;
Why, raindrop-roundels looped together
That lace the face of Penmaen Pool.
 

Then even in weariest wintry hour
Of New Year's month or surly Yule        30
Furred snows, charged tuft above tuft, tower
From darksome darksome Penmaen Pool.
 

And ever, if bound here hardest home,
You've parlour-pastime left and (who'll
Not honour it?) ale like goldy foam        35
That frocks an oar in Penmaen Pool.
 

Then come who pine for peace or pleasure
Away from counter, court, or school,
Spend here your measure of time and treasure
And taste the treats of Penmaen Pool.        40

50.  &#145;Thou art indeed just, Lord, if I contend'
   Justus quidem tu es, Domine, si disputem tecum: verumtamen justa loquar ad te: Quare via impiorum prosperatur? &amp;c.
 









 
THOU art indeed just, Lord, if I contend
With thee; but, sir, so what I plead is just.
Why do sinners' ways prosper? and why must
Disappointment all I endeavour end?
 

  Wert thou my enemy, O thou my friend,        5
How wouldst thou worse, I wonder, than thou dost
Defeat, thwart me? Oh, the sots and thralls of lust
Do in spare hours more thrive than I that spend,
Sir, life upon thy cause. See, banks and brakes
Now leav&egrave;d how thick! lac&egrave;d they are again        10
With fretty chervil, look, and fresh wind shakes
Them; birds build&#151;but not I build; no, but strain,
Time's eunuch, and not breed one work that wakes.
Mine, O thou lord of life, send my roots rain.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
51.  To R. B.
  









 
THE FINE delight that fathers thought; the strong
Spur, live and lancing like the blowpipe flame,
Breathes once and, quench&egrave;d faster than it came,
Leaves yet the mind a mother of immortal song.
Nine months she then, nay years, nine years she long        5
Within her wears, bears, cares and moulds the same:
The widow of an insight lost she lives, with aim
Now known and hand at work now never wrong.
  Sweet fire the sire of muse, my soul needs this;
I want the one rapture of an inspiration.        10
O then if in my lagging lines you miss
The roll, the rise, the carol, the creation,
My winter world, that scarcely breathes that bliss
Now, yields you, with some sighs, our explanation.

WHAT being in rank-old nature should earlier have that breath been
That h&eacute;re p&eacute;rsonal tells off these heart-song powerful peals?&#151;
A bush-browed, beetle-br&oacute;wed b&iacute;llow is it?
With a so&uacute;th-w&eacute;sterly w&iacute;nd bl&uacute;stering, with a tide rolls reels
Of crumbling, fore-foundering, thundering all-surfy seas in; seen        5
&Uacute;nderneath, their glassy barrel, of a fairy green.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Or a jaunting vaunting vaulting assaulting trumpet telling

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
54.  On the Portrait of Two Beautiful Young People
   A Brother and Sister
 









 
O I ADMIRE and sorrow! The heart's eye grieves
Discovering you, dark tramplers, tyrant years.
A juice rides rich through bluebells, in vine leaves,
And beauty's dearest veriest vein is tears.
 

Happy the father, mother of these! Too fast:        5
Not that, but thus far, all with frailty, blest
In one fair fall; but, for time's aftercast,
Creatures all heft, hope, hazard, interest.
 

And are they thus? The fine, the fingering beams
Their young delightful hour do feature down        10
That fleeted else like day-dissolv&egrave;d dreams
Or ringlet-race on burling Barrow brown.
 

She leans on him with such contentment fond
As well the sister sits, would well the wife;
His looks, the soul's own letters, see beyond,        15
Gaze on, and fall directly forth on life.
 

But ah, bright forelock, cluster that you are
Of favoured make and mind and health and youth,
Where lies your landmark, seamark, or soul's star?
There's none but truth can stead you. Christ is truth.        20
 

There 's none but good can b&eacute; good, both for you
And what sways with you, maybe this sweet maid;
None good but God&#151;a warning wav&egrave;d to
One once that was found wanting when Good weighed.
 

Man lives that list, that leaning in the will        25
No wisdom can forecast by gauge or guess,
The selfless self of self, most strange, most still,
Fast furled and all foredrawn to No or Yes.
 

Your feast of; that most in you earnest eye
May but call on your banes to more carouse.        30
Worst will the best. What worm was here, we cry,
To have havoc-pocked so, see, the hung-heavenward boughs?
 

Enough: corruption was the world's first woe.
What need I strain my heart beyond my ken?
O but I bear my burning witness though        35
Against the wild and wanton work of men.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

Let Winter wed one, sow them in her womb,
And she shall child them on the New-world strand.'   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
56.  (Ash-boughs)
  









 
a.NOT of all my eyes see, wandering on the world,
Is anything a milk to the mind so, so sighs deep
Poetry to it, as a tree whose boughs break in the sky.
Say it is ashboughs: whether on a December day and furled
Fast &oacute;r they in clammyish lashtender combs creep        5
Apart wide and new-nestle at heaven most high.
They touch heaven, tabour on it; how their talons sweep
The smouldering enormous winter welkin! May
Mells blue and snowwhite through them, a fringe and fray
Of greenery: it is old earth's groping towards the steep        10
        Heaven whom she childs us by.
 

(Variant from line 7.) b.They touch, they tabour on it, hover on it[; here, there hurled],
        With talons sweep
The smouldering enormous winter welkin. [Eye,
        But more cheer is when] May        15
Mells blue with snowwhite through their fringe and fray
Of greenery and old earth gropes for, grasps at steep
        Heaven with it whom she childs things by.

   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .HOPE holds to Christ the mind's own mirror out
To take His lovely likeness more and more.
It will not well, so she would bring about
An ever brighter burnish than before
And turns to wash it from her welling eyes        5
And breathes the blots off all with sighs on sighs.
Her glass is blest but she as good as blind
Holds till hand aches and wonders what is there;
Her glass drinks light, she darkles down behind,
All of her glorious gainings unaware.        10
   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .I told you that she turned her mirror dim
Betweenwhiles, but she sees herself not Him.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

58.  St. Winefred's Well
  









 
ACT I. SC. IEnter Teryth from riding, Winefred following.T.WHAT is it, Gwen, my girl? why do you hover and haunt me? W.You came by Caerwys, sir?T.            I came by Caerwys.W.                        ThereSome messenger there might have met you from my uncle.T.Your uncle met the messenger&#151;met me; and this the message:Lord Beuno comes to-night.W.            To-night, sir!T.                        Soon, now: thereforeHave all things ready in his room.W.            There needs but little doing.T.Let what there needs be done. Stay! with him one companion,His deacon, Dirvan Warm: twice over must the welcome be,But both will share one cell.&#151;This was good news, Gwenvrewi.W.Ah yes!T.  Why, get thee gone then; tell thy mother I want her.Exit Winefred.No man has such a daughter. The fathers of the worldCall no such maiden &#145;mine'. The deeper grows her dearnessAnd more and more times laces round and round my heart,The more some monstrous hand gropes with clammy fingers there,Tampering with those sweet bines, draws them out, strains them, strains them;Meantime some tongue cries &#145;What, Teryth! what, thou poor fond father!How when this bloom, this honeysuckle, that rides the air so rich about thee,Is all, all sheared away, thus!' Then I sweat for fear.Or else a funeral, and yet 'tis not a funeral,Some pageant which takes tears and I must foot with feeling thatAlive or dead my girl is carried in it, endlesslyGoes marching thro' my mind. What sense is this? It has none.This is too much the father; nay the mother. Fanciful!I here forbid my thoughts to fool themselves with fears.Enter Gwenlo.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .ACT II.&#151;Scene, a wood ending in a steep bank over a dry dene, Winefred having been murdered within. Re-enter Caradoc with a bloody sword.C.My heart, where have we been? What have we seen, my mind?What stroke has Caradoc's right arm dealt? what done? Head of a rebelStruck off it has; written upon lovely limbs,In bloody letters, lessons of earnest, of revenge;Monuments of my earnest, records of my revenge,On one that went against me wh&eacute;reas I had warned her&#151;Warned her! well she knew. I warned her of this work.What work? what harm 's done? There is no harm done, none yet;Perhaps we struck no blow, Gwenvrewi lives perhaps;To makebelieve my mood was&#151;mock. O I might think soBut here, here is a workman from his day's task sweats.Wiped I am sure this was; it seems not well; for still,Still the scarlet swings and dances on the blade.So be it. Thou steel, thou butcher,I c&aacute;n scour thee, fresh burnish thee, sheathe thee in thy dark lair; these dropsNever, never, never in their blue banks again.The woeful, Cradock, O the woeful word! Then what,What have we seen? Her head, sheared from her shoulders, fall,And lapped in shining hair, roll to the bank's edge; thenDown the beetling banks, like water in waterfalls,It stooped and flashed and fell and ran like water away.Her eyes, oh and her eyes!In all her beauty, and sunlight to it is a pit, den, darkness,Foam-falling is not fresh to it, rainbow by it not beaming,In all her body, I say, no place was like her eyes,No piece matched those eyes kept most part much cast downBut, being lifted, immortal, of immortal brightness.Several times I saw them, thrice or four times turning;Round and round they came and flashed towards heaven: O there,There they did appeal. Therefore airy vengeancesAre afoot; heaven-vault fast purpling portends, and what first lightningAny instant falls means me. And I do not repent;I do not and I will not repent, not repent.The blame bear who aroused me. What I have done violentI have like a lion done, lionlike done,Honouring an uncontrolled royal wrathful nature,Mantling passion in a grandeur, crimson grandeur.Now be my pride then perfect, all one piece. HenceforthIn a wide world of defiance Caradoc lives alone,Loyal to his own soul, laying his own law down, no law norLord now curb him for ever. O daring! O deep insight!What is virtue? Valour; only the heart valiant.And right? Only resolution; will, his will unwaveringWho, like me, knowing his nature to the heart home, nature's business,Despatches with no flinching. But will flesh, O can fleshSecond this fiery strain? Not always; O no no!We cannot live this life out; sometimes we must wearyAnd in this darksome world what comfort can I find?Down this darksome world c&oacute;mfort wh&eacute;re can I findWhen 'ts light I quenched; its rose, time's one rich rose, my hand,By her bloom, fast by her fresh, her fleec&egrave;d bloom,Hideous dashed down, leaving earth a winter witheringWith no now, no Gwenvrewi. I must miss her mostThat might have spared her were it but for passion-sake. Yes,To hunger and not have, y&eacute;t hope &oacute;n for, to storm and strive andBe at every assault fresh foiled, worse flung, deeper disappointed,The turmoil and the torment, it has, I swear, a sweetness,Keeps a kind of joy in it, a zest, an edge, an ecstasy,Next after sweet success. I am not left even this;I all my being have hacked in half with her neck: one part,Reason, selfdisposal, choice of better or worse way,Is corpse now, cannot change; my other self, this soul,Life's quick, this k&iacute;nd, this k&eacute;en self-feeling,With dreadful distillation of thoughts sour as blood,Must all day long taste murder. What do n&oacute;w then? Do? Nay,Deed-bound I am; one deed treads all down here cramps all doing. What do? Not yield,Not hope, not pray; despair; ay, that: brazen despair out,Brave all, and take what comes&#151;as here this rabble is come,Whose bloods I reck no more of, no more rank with hersThan sewers with sacred oils. Mankind, that mobs, comes. Come!Enter a crowd, among them Teryth, Gwenlo, Beuno.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .After Winefred's raising from the dead and the breaking out of the fountain.BEUNO.O now while skies are blue, now while seas are salt,While rushy rains shall fall or brooks shall fleet from fountains,While sick men shall cast sighs, of sweet health all despairing,While blind men's eyes shall thirst after daylight, draughts of daylight,Or deaf ears shall desire that lipmusic that 's lost upon them,While cripples are, while lepers, dancers in dismal limb-dance,Fallers in dreadful frothpits, waterfearers wild,Stone, palsy, cancer, cough, lung wasting, womb not bearing,Rupture, running sores, what more? in brief; in burden,As long as men are mortal and God merciful,So long to this sweet spot, this leafy lean-over,This Dry Dene, now no longer dry nor dumb, but moist and musicalWith the uproll and the downcarol of day and night deliveringWater, which keeps thy name, (for not in r&oacute;ck wr&iacute;tten,But in pale water, frail water, wild rash and reeling water,That will not wear a print, that will not stain a pen,Thy venerable record, virgin, is recorded).Here to this holy well shall pilgrimages be,And not from purple Wales only nor from elmy England,But from beyond seas, Erin, France and Flanders, everywhere,Pilgrims, still pilgrims, m&oacute;re p&iacute;lgrims, still more poor pilgrims.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .What sights shall be when some that swung, wretches, on crutchesTheir crutches shall cast from them, on heels of air departing,Or they go rich as roseleaves hence that loathsome c&aacute;me hither!Not now to n&aacute;me evenThose dearer, more divine boons whose haven the heart is.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .As sure as what is most sure, sure as that spring primrosesShall new-dapple next year, sure as to-morrow morning,Amongst come-back-again things, th&iacute;ngs with a revival, things with a recovery,Thy name&#133;   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

59.  &#145;What shall I do for the land that bred me'
  









 
WHAT shall I do for the land that bred me,
Her homes and fields that folded and fed me?&#151;
Be under her banner and live for her honour:
Under her banner I'll live for her honour.
  CHORUS.  Under her banner live for her honour.        5
 

Not the pleasure, the pay, the plunder,
But country and flag, the flag I am under&#151;
There is the shilling that finds me willing
To follow a banner and fight for honour.
  CH.  We follow her banner, we fight for her honour.        10
 

Call me England's fame's fond lover,
Her fame to keep, her fame to recover.
Spend me or end me what God shall send me,
But under her banner I live for her honour.
  CH.  Under her banner we march for her honour.        15
 

Where is the field I must play the man on?
O welcome there their steel or cannon.
Immortal beauty is death with duty,
If under her banner I fall for her honour.
  CH.  Under her banner we fall for her honour.        20

6.  The Silver Jubilee
   To James First Bishop of Shrewsbury on the 25th Year of his Episcopate July 28. 1876
 









 
1THOUGH no high-hung bells or din
Of braggart bugles cry it in&#151;
  What is sound? Nature's round
Makes the Silver Jubilee.
 

2Five and twenty years have run        5
Since sacred fountains to the sun
  Sprang, that but now were shut,
Showering Silver Jubilee.
 

3Feasts, when we shall fall asleep,
Shrewsbury may see others keep;        10
  None but you this her true,
This her Silver Jubilee.
 

4Not today we need lament
Your wealth of life is some way spent:
  Toil has shed round your head        15
Silver but for Jubilee.
 

5Then for her whose velvet vales
Should have pealed with welcome, Wales,
  Let the chime of a rhyme
Utter Silver Jubilee.        20

THE TIMES are nightfall, look, their light grows less;
The times are winter, watch, a world undone:
They waste, they wither worse; they as they run
Or bring more or more blazon man's distress.
And I not help. Nor word now of success:        5
All is from wreck, here, there, to rescue one&#151;
Work which to see scarce so much as begun
Makes welcome death, does dear forgetfulness.
 

Or what is else? There is your world within.
There rid the dragons, root out there the sin.        10
Your will is law in that small commonweal&#133;

61.  Cheery Beggar
  









 
BEYOND M&aacute;gdalen and by the Bridge, on a place called there the Plain,
    In Summer, in a burst of summertime
    Following falls and falls of rain,
When the air was sweet-and-sour of the flown fineflower of
Those goldnails and their gaylinks that hang along a lime;        5
   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    The motion of that man's heart is fine
    Whom want could not make p&iacute;ne, p&iacute;ne
That struggling should not sear him, a gift should cheer him
Like that poor pocket of pence, poor pence of mine.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

Caps occasion with an intellectual fit.
Yet Arthur is a Bowman: his three-heeled timber 'll hit
The bald and b&oacute;ld bl&iacute;nking gold when &aacute;ll 's d&oacute;ne
Right rooting in the bare butt's wincing navel in the sight of the sun.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .        5

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
63.  &#145;The furl of fresh-leaved dogrose down'
  









 
THE FURL of fresh-leaved dogrose down
His cheeks the forth-and-flaunting sun
Had swarthed about with lion-brown
    Before the Spring was done.
 

His locks like all a ravel-rope's-end,        5
  With hempen strands in spray&#151;
Fallow, foam-fallow, hanks&#151;fall'n off their ranks,
  Swung down at a disarray.
 

Or like a juicy and jostling shock
  Of bluebells sheaved in May        10
Or wind-long fleeces on the flock
  A day off shearing day.
 

Then over his turn&egrave;d temples&#151;here&#151;
  Was a rose, or, failing that,
Rough-Robin or five-lipped campion clear        15
  For a beauty-bow to his hat,
And the sunlight sidled, like dewdrops, like dandled diamonds
  Through the sieve of the straw of the plait.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

64.  The Woodlark
  









 
TEEVO cheevo cheevio chee:
O where, what can th&aacute;at be?
Weedio-weedio: there again!
So tiny a trickle of s&oacute;ng-strain;
And all round not to be found        5
For brier, bough, furrow, or gr&eacute;en ground
Before or behind or far or at hand
Either left either right
Anywhere in the s&uacute;nlight.
Well, after all! Ah but hark&#151;        10
&#145;I am the little w&oacute;odlark.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
To-day the sky is two and two
With white strokes and strains of the blue   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Round a ring, around a ring
And while I sail (must listen) I sing   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .        15
The skylark is my cousin and he
Is known to men more than me   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
          &#133;when the cry within
Says Go on then I go on
Till the longing is less and the good gone        20
 

But down drop, if it says Stop,
To the all-a-leaf of the tr&eacute;etop
And after that off the bough   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
I &aacute;m so v&eacute;ry, O so&oacute; very glad
That I d&oacute; th&iacute;nk there is not to be had&#133;   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .        25
The blue wheat-acre is underneath
And the braided ear breaks out of the sheath,
The ear in milk, lush the sash,
And crush-silk poppies aflash,
The blood-gush blade-gash        30
Flame-rash rudred
Bud shelling or broad-shed
Tatter-tassel-tangled and dingle-a-dangled
Dandy-hung dainty head.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
And down &#133; the furrow dry        35
Sunspurge and oxeye
And laced-leaved lovely
Foam-tuft fumitory   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Through the velvety wind V-winged
To the nest's nook I balance and buoy        40
With a sweet joy of a sweet joy,
Sweet, of a sweet, of a sweet joy
Of a sweet&#151;a sweet&#151;sweet&#151;joy.'

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
65.  Moonrise
  









 
I AWOKE in the Midsummer not to call night, ' in the white and the walk of the morning:
The moon, dwindled and thinned to the fringe ' of a finger-nail held to the candle,
Or paring of paradisa&iuml;cal fruit, ' lovely in waning but lustreless,
Stepped from the stool, drew back from the barrow, ' of dark Maenefa the mountain;
A cusp still clasped him, a fluke yet fanged him, ' entangled him, not quit utterly.        5
This was the prized, the desirable sight, ' unsought, presented so easily,
Parted me leaf and leaf, divided me, ' eyelid and eyelid of slumber.

66.  &#145;Repeat that, repeat'
  









 
REPEAT that, repeat,
Cuckoo, bird, and open ear wells, heart-springs, delightfully sweet,
With a ballad, with a ballad, a rebound
Off trundled timber and scoops of the hillside ground, hollow hollow hollow ground:
The whole landscape flushes on a sudden at a sound.        5

68.  &#145;The child is father to the man'
  









 
&#145;THE CHILD is father to the man.'
How can he be? The words are wild.
Suck any sense from that who can:
&#145;The child is father to the man.'
No; what the poet did write ran,        5
&#145;The man is father to the child.'
&#145;The child is father to the man!'
How can he be? The words are wild.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
69.  &#145;The shepherd's brow, fronting forked lightning, owns'
  









 
THE SHEPHERD'S brow, fronting forked lightning, owns
The horror and the havoc and the glory
Of it. Angels fall, they are towers, from heaven&#151;a story
Of just, majestical, and giant groans.
But man&#151;we, scaffold of score brittle bones;        5
Who breathe, from groundlong babyhood to hoary
Age gasp; whose breath is our memento mori&#151;
What bass is our viol for tragic tones?
He! Hand to mouth he lives, and voids with shame;
And, blazoned in however bold the name,        10
Man Jack the man is, just; his mate a hussy.
And I that die these deaths, that feed this flame,
That &#133; in smooth spoons spy life's masque mirrored: tame
My tempests there, my fire and fever fussy.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
7.  God's Grandeur
  









 
THE WORLD is charged with the grandeur of God.
  It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;
  It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil
Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;        5
  And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;
  And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.
 

And for all this, nature is never spent;
  There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;        10
And though the last lights off the black West went
  Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs&#151;
Because the Holy Ghost over the bent
  World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.

70.  To his Watch
  









 
MORTAL my mate, bearing my rock-a-heart
Warm beat with cold beat company, shall I
Earlier or you fail at our force, and lie
The ruins of, rifled, once a world of art?
The telling time our task is; time's some part,        5
Not all, but we were framed to fail and die&#151;
One spell and well that one. There, ah thereby
Is comfort's carol of all or woe's worst smart.
 

Field-flown, the departed day no morning brings
Saying &#145;This was yours' with her, but new one, worse,        10
And then that last and shortest&#133;

STRIKE, churl; hurl, cheerless wind, then; heltering hail
May's beauty massacre and wisp&egrave;d wild clouds grow
Out on the giant air; tell Summer No,
Bid joy back, have at the harvest, keep Hope pale.

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
72.  Epithalamion
  









 
HARK, hearer, hear what I do; lend a thought now, make believe
We are leafwhelmed somewhere with the hood
Of some branchy bunchy bushybowered wood,
Southern dene or Lancashire clough or Devon cleave,
That leans along the loins of hills, where a candycoloured, where a gluegold-brown        5
Marbled river, boisterously beautiful, between
Roots and rocks is danced and dandled, all in froth and waterblowballs, down.
We are there, when we hear a shout
That the hanging honeysuck, the dogeared hazels in the cover
Makes dither, makes hover        10
And the riot of a rout
Of, it must be, boys from the town
Bathing: it is summer's sovereign good.
 

By there comes a listless stranger: beckoned by the noise
He drops towards the river: unseen        15
Sees the bevy of them, how the boys
With dare and with downdolphinry and bellbright bodies huddling out,
Are earthworld, airworld, waterworld thorough hurled, all by turn and turn about.
 

This garland of their gambols flashes in his breast
Into such a sudden zest        20
Of summertime joys
That he hies to a pool neighbouring; sees it is the best
There; sweetest, freshest, shadowiest;
Fairyland; silk-beech, scrolled ash, packed sycamore, wild wychelm, hornbeam fretty overstood
By. Rafts and rafts of flake-leaves light, dealt so, painted on the air,        25
Hang as still as hawk or hawkmoth, as the stars or as the angels there,
Like the thing that never knew the earth, never off roots
Rose. Here he feasts: lovely all is! No more: off with&#151;down he dings
His bleach&egrave;d both and woolwoven wear:
Careless these in coloured wisp        30
All lie tumbled-to; then with loop-locks
Forward falling, forehead frowning, lips crisp
Over finger-teasing task, his twiny boots
Fast he opens, last he offwrings
Till walk the world he can with bare his feet        35
And come where lies a coffer, burly all of blocks
Built of chancequarri&egrave;d, selfquain&egrave;d rocks
And the water warbles over into, filleted with glassy grassy quicksilvery shiv&egrave;s and shoots
And with heavenfallen freshness down from moorland still brims,
Dark or daylight on and on. Here he will then, here he will the fleet        40
Flinty kindcold element let break across his limbs
Long. Where we leave him, froliclavish while he looks about him, laughs, swims.
Enough now; since the sacred matter that I mean
I should be wronging longer leaving it to float
Upon this only gambolling and echoing-of-earth note&#151;        45
What is &#133; the delightful dene?
Wedlock. What the water? Spousal love.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Father, mother, brothers, sisters, friends
Into fairy trees, wild flowers, wood ferns
Rank&egrave;d round the bower   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .        50

73.  &#145;Thee, God, I come from, to thee go'
  









 
THEE, God, I come from, to thee go,
All day long I like fountain flow
From thy hand out, swayed about
Mote-like in thy mighty glow.
 

What I know of thee I bless,        5
As acknowledging thy stress
On my being and as seeing
Something of thy holiness.
 

Once I turned from thee and hid,
Bound on what thou hadst forbid;        10
Sow the wind I would; I sinned:
I repent of what I did.
 

Bad I am, but yet thy child.
Father, be thou reconciled.
Spare thou me, since I see        15
With thy might that thou art mild.
 

I have life before me still
And thy purpose to fulfil;
Yea a debt to pay thee yet:
Help me, sir, and so I will.        20
 

But thou bidst, and just thou art,
Me shew mercy from my heart
Towards my brother, every other
Man my mate and counterpart.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#150;89).  Poems.  1918.
 
74.  &#145;To him who ever thought with love of me'
  









 
TO him who ever thought with love of me
Or ever did for my sake some good deed
I will appear, looking such charity
And kind compassion, at his life's last need
That he will out of hand and heartily        5
Repent he sinned and all his sins be freed.


 See Notes.

8.  The Starlight Night
  









 
LOOK at the stars! look, look up at the skies!
  O look at all the fire-folk sitting in the air!
  The bright boroughs, the circle-citadels there!
Down in dim woods the diamond delves! the elves'-eyes!
The grey lawns cold where gold, where quickgold lies!        5
  Wind-beat whitebeam! airy abeles set on a flare!
  Flake-doves sent floating forth at a farmyard scare!&#151;
Ah well! it is all a purchase, all is a prize.
Buy then! bid then!&#151;What?&#151;Prayer, patience, aims, vows.
Look, look: a May-mess, like on orchard boughs!        10
  Look! March-bloom, like on mealed-with-yellow sallows!
These are indeed the barn; withindoors house
The shocks. This piece-bright paling shuts the spouse
  Christ home, Christ and his mother and all his hallows.


 See Notes.

9.  Spring
  









 
NOTHING is so beautiful as spring&#151;
  When weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;
  Thrush's eggs look little low heavens, and thrush
Through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring
The ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing;        5
  The glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush
  The descending blue; that blue is all in a rush
With richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.
 

What is all this juice and all this joy?
  A strain of the earth's sweet being in the beginning        10
In Eden garden.&#151;Have, get, before it cloy,
  Before it cloud, Christ, lord, and sour with sinning,
Innocent mind and Mayday in girl and boy,
  Most, O maid's child, thy choice and worthy the winning.
