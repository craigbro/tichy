otherwise, run with a backup first
otherwise, seems fine to me, you can always test with the translate-logical-pathname func
otherwise, wait like 15 minutes for me to update setup.sh
otherwise, you'll need some kinda localized 'config.pl' or some such that customizes INC
otherwise, you're effectively delaying 2.1 release and that fucks me up
otherwise, you're just blowing wind when you say you want a reiterable instance

pam, 3.0 will handle that
pam, I am on it
pam, I bring you cafe, do you want some unfrothed milk in it?
pam, I can run you thru that process if you want
pam, I guess my point is that bugzilla is the way to ensure that it is followed up on, and not random meetings in the hall with developers or waiting for them to contact the support people every time they communicate.  Not to imply you were arguing for something different...
pam, I need a hand with bug 5294
pam, I talked to craigl about this yesterday too.  I'm obviouslt can't give consent, and I am not trying to say you missed something.
pam, I was able to make reservations and such with no prob
pam, I'll head upa nd see what you're running into after I eat

pam, do you mean ucb?
pam, gordon need fixing then?
pam, got a moment?
pam, got some time for bug-hunting?
pam, groovus
pam, he can't check with you every time he communicates with the client
pam, he just said it looked like it was operating just fine
pam, hopefully the state will not fall into the ocean until you get back
pam, how much did you see?
pam, i assume you're talking about printing to accd printers, right?
pam, i didn't think of it earlier, but we could easily set up the filedrop so that it deleted the file when the import was completed.
pam, i fixed bug 4103, and want to make sure the fix wasn't special-case, so was asking if you would retest please.
pam, i fixed it but want to be sure it isn't a special-case fix
pam, i had to stop at walgreens and buy some scrubs since i was soaked
pam, i think patron-class is imported just like everything else.  just a second, i'll check
pam, i was vague.  i mean about us deleting the file after the import, so they wouldn't have to guess when we were finished with it.
pam, i'll do the ucla resource import -- after hours, right?
pam, i'll look
pam, i'll make them
pam, i'll try
pam, i'm already logged in, i'll delete an entry from patron.txt
pam, i'm entering barcodes in the USC instance, and getting a response in 2 seconds or less
pam, i'm leaving webco-support all to you ... you know what to do :)
pam, i'm logged in through browser and via console
pam, i'm trying to find the lisp process for that
pam, i'm wondering how to find allocated resources whose pickup time + grace period is expired
pam, in 3.0?????
pam, in general, the imported patrons can't be edited.  is patron-class an exception to that?
pam, it just started -- last time it took ~7 minutes
pam, it should be good now.  You may have ot go thru the chooser to choose them again
pam, it was not doing a redirect, it is doing it now
pam, it's assigned to me
pam, it's because that was only every used by SAIC and it came from psoft
pam, it's destructive -- if someone's not in the patron.txt, they will be marked as deleted
pam, it's just a joke about code ownership -- once you understand a piece of code you are never allowed to work on it again.
pam, it's loaded
pam, josh isn't here
pam, josh, on the SAIC fron,t am seeing succesful sync
pam, josh: is this change to get support' page on the site right?
pam, just got mail from Victor Emerson -- he forgot to put sweetie at the end of his sentences.
pam, just point me at them
pam, just reproduced on beta
pam, kicking art center bottom
pam, lee, can I talk to yall about pickup and accompanying people?
pam, let me finish my commits and I will
pam, looks like a migration issue
pam, looks like cacheing problem
pam, make the fine for 0.00 dollars then
pam, may I ask you about bug 5288?
pam, me too, since I gotta get UCLA set up and ready for review
pam, more info on 4163 needed.  what is the span of the current alllcation, and which resource, and when is the checkout it is for
pam, my instance has about 15 more mnutes before I can test that bug
pam, need clarification for bug 4469
pam, need to talk to you about 5269
pam, no
pam, no data was migrated for beta.webcheckout.net
pam, no it will not
pam, no problem
pam, no shazbot
pam, none of those numbers are in the patron.txt file for accd
pam, nope
pam, oh you know I didn't call you dumb, just that idea dumb
pam, ok, when?  i promised joel i'd give a report on what we found tomorrow am
pam, on which isntance?
pam, pliskin.onshored.com is a UCB clone for your perusal
pam, quick, we need another bug
pam, ran the fildrop on artcenter.webcheckout.net, and it's set up to run midnight from now on.
pam, read the description of the Contact name field in that same requirement
pam, ready
pam, refresh my memory
pam, restarted
pam, sorry, was just making sure you could dial extensions from the support submenu
pam, stop development?
pam, sure
pam, thanks.
pam, thanks.  What do you think Current fees for unreturned items should be? $10.00 or $0.00
pam, that AACD problem is a DNS propagation
pam, that means they are not searchable or in result sets
pam, the ui for filedrop should announce that clicking will schedule a pre-configured filedrop to be run now
pam, they are going to artcenter.webcheckout.com I bet
pam, they are going to artcenter.webcheckout.com not artcetner.webcheckout.net I bet
pam, they're just josh'ing you
pam, to change the patron-class of an imported student, they would have to change it in the import file.
pam, until you add the sour cream, that is
pam, we need to re-record the support message
pam, we will likely finish it up, but not guaranteed 8)
pam, were there people in the artcenter instance before today?
pam, what do they mean down?
pam, what is that plug label your phone is in now?
pam, what is the problem with timesheet?  I am using it now?
pam, what's up?
pam, when you say Utah do you really mean Baylor?
pam, whenever you ropen a bug you have to be sure to povide even more detail in how your replicated the bug, because if i close it out you can assume that I at least went thru the most obvious cases when testing
pam, where did you go?
pam, will do as soon as they close for the day
pam, would you like me to add our comments to bug 5063?
pam, yah
pam, yes
pam, yes indeed I am
pam, you are going to ACCD?
pam, you around?
pam, you could add a fine
pam, you mean after your apology?
pam, you need better quoting in yer email program
pam, you want some
pam, your mail reminded me...did you relay my answer to artcenter re: filedrop, or should i mail them?
pam, ypu want coffee
pam,to be hard, just put , ya fewl, at the end of all your sentenced.

pam: 5243 is not REALY a bug
pam: 7:15 tonight at landmark century. come!
pam: After that my plan is to continue filling in gaping holes, like Chapter 8. But there is so much confusion over circulation policies that I'm tempted to complete an illustration of that process.
pam: BTW, pliskin is now 3.0 with demo data and UCB customizations loaded
pam: BTW, the data on ucb.e.n is from thid mornings production dump
pam: Evergreen should be gettin 3.0.2 before 3.1 though
pam: FYI I've delegated CBL to handle the remote printing issue for ACCD, we're now looking at alternatives to the ssh forwarding solution
pam: Hah! I laugh at your bugs and make them go away!
pam: I am merely giving you instructions
pam: I am not mad, no need to be defensive
pam: I am working on UCB right now.  There is some wierdness
pam: I bumped it from the milestone
pam: I could reload dev if you like
pam: I couldnt create a repeat at all
pam: I didn't email about the hang
pam: I didn't touch the umich server so it is the same as yesterday
pam: I don't think so
pam: I dropped the ball on UCLA 
pam: I guess it's just too broken to test with
pam: I haven't made the projex changes yet
pam: I just did a day before pickup as boss, no problem
pam: I just found a gaping whole in the groups things and that reminds me to ask you how far you got in the cross-checking between 2.0.10 and 2.1 ?
pam: I just upgraded timesheet, can you check if the problem you had is fixed?
pam: I liked it a lot, but I know the book almost word for word.
pam: I might be back tho if it's 4:30 my time
pam: I replied on the UCB enhs
pam: I see data there...
pam: I shall email her
pam: I show it loaded at 9 hours... but that will need to be reviewed, ok?
pam: I still need an expense form
pam: I take it you're aware of what happened?
pam: I talked to him about it, yes
pam: I think it's just that gohper is rather slow
pam: I think the applet is oversized vertically tho
pam: I totally don't understand what you're saying
pam: I will make it so
pam: I would need a legend for this import file.  What is in each column before I can discuss its dificulty
pam: I'm a little uncomfortable mass-closing ACCD bugs or remilestoning them
pam: I'm also trying to see what Help topic comes up for each screen, because some of them don't make sense.
pam: I'm doing some work on making the demo more like the 2.0.x demo
pam: I'm leaving it to you to reply to  Jane Suvajian
pam: I'm shocked they find the fixes in 2.0.7 all that critical -- Id no't see all that many crit fixes in 2.0.7
pam: IMO, it was the best job of book --> film ever done. 
pam: Ill look
pam: Im making soup
pam: Im pretty sure, yes
pam: It usualy has media
pam: Its been done already
pam: UCB in the haus
pam: UCLA is back with there data loaded
pam: a distinction will need to be made, outside of bugzilla, which of their bus is worth delaying 3.0 over
pam: academic-level is not in the patron file -- mapping something else to it would cost money
pam: accd needs to do that one over again
pam: accd won't be able to set up stations if they all come thru NAT
pam: acknowledge and grovel please :)
pam: actually I gotta step out
pam: actually we should probably update the instance and migrate their data
pam: adam approves
pam: adam can handle it or our delicate customers can wait until monday ;)
pam: adam changed something about umich patron load recently, i'll look it over and get back to you
pam: adam instance back, better now?
pam: adam:  ok, what do you mean by get the bug list straight?  should I call you to discuss?
pam: adam: are you still poking at pliskin?
pam: all time is 8 hours off or so
pam: already replied, they are scheduled for tonight
pam: also let me know how it looks as a demo...
pam: also, Art Center
pam: also, I misunderstood what you were asking -- I thought you were asking whether the way to deterine the set of bugs was to talk to me
pam: also, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee
pam: and if he asks me for one more thing for this customer, the knee hinge will surely activate to his backside
pam: and it's critical to get it up rapidly, I can do tonight
pam: and let mme know job#s ?
pam: and use the flat fee on that
pam: andy called me
pam: any convenitne time... my umich mtg wasn't today but rather is tomorrow
pam: any luck with conco?
pam: any still no worky, but it can be simulated by removing that field from the search
pam: aok?
pam: apparently
pam: are there any paid contracts or specific demands for bug 5078 ?
pam: are we blowing out the old ucb demo or is a 2.1 demo and a 3.0 demo required?
pam: are we not supposed to mention this to gordon?
pam: are you answering max's email?
pam: are you done with that connection to denver?
pam: are you free?
pam: are you good for umich stuff ?
pam: are you still around?
pam: are you still there?
pam: are you there?
pam: are you using the chapman instance for training?
pam: around?
pam: artcenter issue fixed
pam: artcenter should be up now
pam: artcenter's file has 2481 entries.  Do they think they are sending us more?  
pam: as sleepy as I am right now, about 18 hours
pam: ask Pyne-san
pam: ask josh
pam: ask them if they want to be on the free auto-upgrade service in the future
pam: at 4pm
pam: at the moment I've just finished streamlining the checkout and reservation topcis, and adding a new Reference chapter.
pam: be careful of that headset thing
pam: be safe and file that boog pls
pam: being drunk at work might help
pam: beta is back
pam: beta is updated
pam: beta.w.n done
pam: better yet put that on the bug
pam: btw, the 2.1 demo will include, also, 50 random checkouts and 150 random reservations...
pam: btwi'll contact agenty about the invoices
pam: bug 4836 is on the branch, no?
pam: bummer
pam: but I reserve the right to cancel of course :)
pam: but it's a bit eclectic and not in everyone's taste.
pam: but see, the find alloc screen is a bit diff...
pam: but tell them that double-quotes should not be used as a marking for inches
pam: but the end time for all the Next 10 reservations is all in the past 
pam: but yah, operators do have checkout centers too
pam: can you call donal little at syracuse and try to get a more coherent bug report out of him for the duplicate resource types?
pam: can you call joel inden and find out what's up with his ram sitch

pam: can you text message me? 773-456-8554
pam: can you try some of those tricks you got to go real slow at usc?
pam: can you try to spot any other problemos in the projex file prior to mtg today?
pam: cancel away
pam: cancelled CK-2516 anyways tho
pam: check circulation stuff, policies, returns, renews, that stuff again
pam: checking a new round of group screen enhancements
pam: clarify pls
pam: click or have them click on the yellow banner thing on the lef tthat says webcheckout
pam: come to the dark sidea
pam: cooL?
pam: cool
pam: cool, checked in changes to projex
pam: could you look at that resource and see if it's in the right state now?
pam: craig says it's the chain that's broke, not the toilet clogged
pam: demo should work for you now.
pam: did we ever get any additional feedback from Richard Bloom on bug 4987
pam: did you clue them?
pam: did you ever get clarification on restricted mode?
pam: did you file that as a bug?
pam: did you file that new ucb fookoop?
pam: did you file that?
pam: did you really want to put bug 4852 on 2.0.x ?
pam: did you see Chris Dutton's question about duplicate resource names
pam: did you see my message about UCLA?
pam: did you see rik torres' mail?
pam: did you see what I said?
pam: didn't see any 3.1 bugs from you yet???
pam: do I really?
pam: do chapman have linux staff 
pam: do file it, but it's a Logic: Data Migration issue, I'm pretty sure
pam: do we have dental ?
pam: do you know how to check the splash screen?
pam: do you know what the log out bug# was?
pam: do you know which location at USC has the problem?
pam: do you remember the date that chapman server was sentback to them and if they ever received it?
pam: do you think you can take that projex stuff and come up with the timeline stuff?
pam: do you wanna do the mtg today or tomorrow?
pam: do you want me to contact accd sysadmins?  i'd heard you were the default route for that type of communication
pam: does LCC really only have 682 resources?
pam: does your voice mail say to call me for webco-support before 1PM Central?
pam: don't ask, just file
pam: don't bother actually
pam: don't worry, I've been helping him all day
pam: done
pam: dunno yet, try again later
pam: e.g., requires landlord servicing or a trip to the hardware store perhaps
pam: eh?
pam: encourage him to test ucb 2.0.10 instance, ucb.webcheckout.net
pam: eric is gone?
pam: eric said something about lots of minutes showing up on the fonebill for the SAIC modem
pam: even so...
pam: eventually we will customize it to purge but for now everything is kept until hell freezes over
pam: evergreen is hitting an old 2.0.11 bug wherein patrons with local email don't get mail sent
pam: ew
pam: file bug accordingly -- it might be applet bug, might be import bug
pam: file it with contexts
pam: finalizing pricing for artcenter -- do you have figures for operator trianing and manager training?
pam: find out if they've got any way to reprod. that bug Richrd emailed in
pam: find-allocations now has [x] next to checkout-center selecta
pam: fixing, can you notify ucb when it's back?
pam: for stuff like 5113, put that on the support action milestone instead of 2.0.11
pam: for the search screeN?
pam: for you as well as them?
pam: forward to me I guess
pam: from what machine?
pam: get soup
pam: get us a six pack of p4 gigahertz desktops will ya
pam: getting there
pam: go to beta.webchekcout.net
pam: going to start alpha upgrade now, you may experience some slowness or even stoppage
pam: good. thanks. you have fresh eyes for it and can provide good usability feedback. the only way you can hurt my feelings is if you accuse me of not trying. @:)
pam: greetz
pam: ha sit improved
pam: had to install a different version of secure shell to be able to connect to their machine with public keys
pam: has UCB realy even looked at their demo?
pam: have him call me
pam: have we heard anything from richard bloom wrt bug 4987?
pam: have we received any import files from ACCD yet?
pam: have you heard anything from kristine?
pam: he can setup his own account in bugzilla
pam: he quit cigs anyhow
pam: here in a few we can update demo
pam: here's what changed: the filedrop for umich is now destructive -- which means that patrons are updated now, instead of just added
pam: hey
pam: hey, I'm around
pam: hi five baby!
pam: hold on, fixing something unrelated
pam: how bout just ask max what he's trying to point out
pam: how does demo look?
pam: how many reservations do they do a day ?
pam: how was yer trip
pam: i already deftly parried the USC one
pam: i already responded to that Penny watkins multiple import question
pam: i am, now
pam: i believe we had to send it back to them for fixy, didn't we?
pam: i can get them after i get usc
pam: i can run the util to remove the errant location schedule nodes
pam: i can take care of all stuff in new client forms
pam: i can't go either. you going tues?

pam: i don't know what josh was doing .. but i'll load it if you want
pam: i don't know yet
pam: i don't remember what lcc was supposed to do.  is there a bug number?
pam: i don't think chapman's server is accesible
pam: i don't think so
pam: i doubt it will be done by the time of your meeting though
pam: i dunno 
pam: i dunno what that error means aside from it was expecting a time and got nothing
pam: i entered 001-101-1000 in person box; hit enter; text was replaced with SRO-281 none
pam: i figured out the trick with the chapman import
pam: i fixed that URI thing
pam: i got it down to about 4 seconds to load the screens
pam: i guess i assumed your consent
pam: i guess put me down for a half day, i am gonna work from home
pam: i have a friend works for mrskin.com
pam: i have a workaround for him 
pam: i just read that 
pam: i know what rik means by read receipt
pam: i left the rhoadarmer support email for ya
pam: i mean which webcheckout instance?
pam: i need tips on reproducing usc slowness locally
pam: i replied to his email
pam: i responded to that guy from chapman's proxy problems
pam: i suggest doing a few that way, just so they get the gist
pam: i think i did talk to max about invoicing but had to pass him off to ayres
pam: i thought  i stated pretty clearly to you last night that i was going to do it this morning at 7:00 PST
pam: i told him to call me whenever he wanted to talk about it but i have no recollection of him actually calling
pam: i updated beta
pam: i updated it this morning
pam: i was at lunch.  adam wants to use ssh port forwarding
pam: i was starting to wonder about that
pam: i will never get cross with you for finding a bug
pam: i'll let you know when it's back, momento
pam: i'll look at accd patron integration bug now
pam: i'll probably be around for another hour to 90 mins if you want me  to address any specific issues
pam: i'll turn things back on tonight -- do you want to write to them, or should I
pam: i'm checking
pam: i'm going to set some stuff on lsu real quick 
pam: i'm moving ithaca to 3.0
pam: i'm not being touchy, just careful -- do you want me to reply to latest mail, or would you prefer to do it?
pam: i'm not calling or writing anyone til i hear from you
pam: i'm ready
pam: i'm replying unless you'd rather have cbl do it
pam: i'm sore but it feels good
pam: i'm taking ucla.w.n down for update -- it's about two weeks out of date
pam: i'm talking with artcenter admins now, trying to diagnose the problem
pam: if it's just fixed in bugzilla that probably means fixed in CVS
pam: if not it's a bug... I don't think it's really 2.0.10 though
pam: if they have approved the monies ...
pam: if we need to talk, can we do it now?
pam: if you don't understand the process of how to ship non-trivial fixes to customers, I can write that up to you
pam: if you have any feedback on the documentation while you're trying to learn wco, I'd love to hear it.
pam: ill give the update the old college try
pam: ill look at bets
pam: im looking at Bug 4735
pam: im not sure that gets to the root of the probelm.
pam: in a sec...
pam: in the member or member id
pam: in the timeline, it might be good to specify, this is them, this is us... who's responsible
pam: in your bugs, you might set the milestones and also mention the URL you are using
pam: is UPortland added as a client in timesheet?
pam: is UPortland added as a client?
pam: is it ok for me to takedown and update accd now?
pam: is it only fees or fees, fines and other policies
pam: is it working at all?
pam: is that filed on 2.0.x ?
pam: is there someone in Rik DeLisle's office that I can ask to check the printer now?
pam: is this import resources or does it say something about resource types too?
pam: is this part of artcenter-enh ?
pam: is your question w.r.t. the same issue?
pam: isn't that already filed?
pam: isnt that illegal?
pam: it can be customized
pam: it didn't work
pam: it does
pam: it does that now and again
pam: it may require us to fix
pam: it should be there now
pam: it shouldn't prevent taking offline, no, not if it's just that it was in a cancelled reservatin --- file a boog for that
pam: it was an intense sensory shock @:)
pam: it would be an honor to update beta for you
pam: it's always fine to file bugs
pam: it's back
pam: it's back now
pam: it's funny, I had completely forgotten that artcenter already gave us rsrc data with the hierarchy
pam: it's kewl, I can handle it from here
pam: it's less data than the mich one
pam: it's not just you... every computer wants to rebel against the human overlords
pam: it's pretty clear they ddidn't look very closely
pam: it's the 2.0.10 double-booking bug
pam: it's up
pam: ithaca being upgraded to 3.0 as we speak
pam: ithaca fucked up their patron classes again
pam: its a cinch that monica and I will be at yer shindig tomorrow
pam: its back
pam: josh filed the bug
pam: josh is out
pam: just ask me here if you still have questions
pam: just call me
pam: just find out
pam: just pick a time
pam: just so you know, there is a Production Instances bugzilla component for when production instances have site-specific problems like non-working manuals....
pam: just tell them to ignore that field until 3.0
pam: lansing already has an account on gopher
pam: lansing is not currently running a filedrop
pam: lansing should be able to log in now
pam: last time we were there it was after camping in the utah desert for 2 weeks.
pam: left frame
pam: let me know when is a good time to fix you up with some cvs action 
pam: let me know when you are there
pam: let me restart the instance
pam: let me see
pam: lets play it by ear... bring me in if you need to in the course of the call, if I'm around
pam: log in again then
pam: look at that URL
pam: looks like billing time for wheaton
pam: make sure you can still make a checkout
pam: max had wrong IP address
pam: maybe i'll upgrade postgres in the morning
pam: maybe put a note on the resrevation that it's an onshore test please ignore
pam: me neither
pam: moved -- find people
pam: my email had names, not contact info... that must come from gary I guess
pam: my error
pam: my foot is starting to itch to kick dan's candy ass
pam: my instance will be UCBish in 10 minutes
pam: my question again: were they getting the EC error?
pam: nesta said he'd pick it up on his way into the office
pam: nice attitude
pam: no
pam: no cancellation
pam: no josh?
pam: no luck with emily right?
pam: no plans afterwards. laur & andy will want to go home right after the moovie, so gimme a call on me celly if you want to do something after matt & holly's
pam: no problem....
pam: no we don't customize the import code on a case-by-case basis
pam: no worries
pam: no, I can't email passwords
pam: no, i had a private today. nice!
pam: no, see my mail to wco-support
pam: no, you sounded melancholy
pam: non-bug then
pam: nope
pam: nope...
pam: not sure
pam: not sure it covers alll he would like
pam: note that this will automatically become our fault later :)
pam: note: not dropfile integration, but initial patron import
pam: oh
pam: oh, I think I know what that is... the status bar you mean right?
pam: oh... one more thing... I'd like to associate pricing for the training options...
pam: ok
pam: ok, Im not in any rush
pam: ok, call anytime
pam: ok, coming back, try to make it happen again and if so, file blocker pls
pam: ok, it's up... you can get in?
pam: ok, my bad
pam: ok, shit, restarting
pam: ok... you might wanna restart that
pam: ok?
pam: okey doke
pam: on 2.0.x?
pam: on bug 4684, gary says back button -- that is back button on his browser?
pam: on the status bar issue, is better now right?
pam: or should I talk to sales first?
pam: pearson isn't in the file
pam: phone doesn't work at the moment, my line is speammed
pam: pick an rtype, go to policy
pam: please get
pam: please read my mail to support about it too
pam: please stop doing that
pam: please test this: setup station to print to an invalid IP, e.g., your own IP or make one up
pam: please try to achieve *coverage* -- one way to do this is to work thru the test checklist, esp the bits we haven't already done
pam: pls try again
pam: probably file a bug for it against 3.0
pam: probably note that in the boog
pam: probalby UI: reports
pam: production instance bug, it's some degenerate data condition
pam: projex updated
pam: public pls
pam: read the gordon-related email
pam: read up
pam: really?
pam: regarding lori robertsons bug...
pam: regarding unsubscribe requests coming to webco-support....
pam: remember how they put EVERY resource in it's own resource type?
pam: richard bloom is UCB right?
pam: rick and rik do not answer
pam: right
pam: right, also good idea because that means that X more customers could pay for it 
pam: rik won't even be there for a couple of hours
pam: saic is pestering me about special-casing my hc enrollment .. when did you say data comes from administaff?
pam: same as before
pam: same holds true
pam: scattered thruout ... there is no such beast
pam: see email on the rtype moving thing
pam: see lee's explanation on bug 4106
pam: see my reply on that bug
pam: see projex for which features are in which release
pam: see support.webcheckout.net -> for testers
pam: sent a couple more test emails
pam: sept 30th might work for me
pam: sever all ties to dan, be sane :)
pam: she is lazy and should be disciplined
pam: shorter probably not desirable
pam: should have it working soon
pam: should patron import for art center have a separate job id from resource import?
pam: should we do our status mtg tomorrow?  My head is bursting...
pam: skeletor.onshored.com:5050
pam: so don't bother entering that stuff
pam: so far no errors on chapman resource improt
pam: so sorry sooo so so sorry
pam: so the performance on their actual server is ok then?
pam: so when do you want josh or I to test you for phone support?
pam: so you got rik ? in regards to customizability of agreement form, you know the answer I think
pam: so you see, they are NOT deleted, but their status, as alien people is DELETED
pam: so... they need to fix their hierarchy perhaps?
pam: some lady is calling JR every 30 minutes about something or other, needing to talk to Eric about pricing ... it sounds like a sales pitch though
pam: sorry... I tried
pam: sounds good
pam: sounds suspicious
pam: starting what date?
pam: still only manual
pam: still?
pam: sure
pam: sure thing
pam: sure! thanks!
pam: sure, cite cases of the clipping in the boog too  -- thx
pam: sure, ok, email me the mtg time
pam: sure...
pam: surely
pam: talking to AACD about lpr printing
pam: tell him to cancel it and re-enter and hopefully we'll have 3.0 ready for them by the end of the month
pam: test instances do not preserve data
pam: thank you for letter: everything looks good now
pam: thanks
pam: that delete bug already fixed in 2.0.10 btw
pam: that error means it's not listening
pam: that was a dumb joke
pam: that would be extra sweeet
pam: that would be great. you can also enter doc bugs against me in bugzilla.
pam: that's a kicker
pam: that's a wacky one...
pam: that's alreaedy filed
pam: that's cool ya fewl!
pam: that's fine
pam: that's in 2.1, not 2.0.10
pam: that's odd, I did some checkouts
pam: that's right, media was off, damn
pam: that's what we're thinking of
pam: thats the result of the applet waiting for a reply to the last message it sent to the server I think
pam: the NIL thing is still in 2.0.8
pam: the SFSU file you sent me is sorta not a zip file
pam: the account codes and department codes are exactly what appear in the UCB production DB
pam: the artcenter hours spreadsheet is up on the internal site now
pam: the component there would UI: Circulation applet I would guess
pam: the context here, I think ,is that we're starting prior to the PO 
pam: the folks at administaff are the bees knees
pam: the last time it was updated according to adam's procedures was on April 28
pam: the limnk is fixed, but yoiu will need to relogin to see it 
pam: the one the advisory was about...
pam: the soup is for you too
pam: the value that was printer in pre 3.0.1 will be printer host.
pam: the way you asked
pam: then I'll go ahead and load it up..
pam: there is also the option of reconfiguring the import so it is not destructive
pam: there's a bunch of stuff on the printer queue on artcenter 
pam: there's an even easier way
pam: they are supposed to enter the media there...
pam: they must have Resource Type set for all records
pam: they musta not even looked at the alloc screens tho
pam: they should add a setup unserialized resource on an new rtype
pam: they were indeed down
pam: this maybe needs discussion
pam: tripple
pam: try now
pam: try projex now
pam: tues & wed are pretty bad for me
pam: ucb instance loading. ETA 15 minutes
pam: ucb rtype hierarchy fixed on ucb.w.n
pam: ucb.w.n comming down for a second
pam: ucb.w.n finaly up, and it looks happy
pam: ucla is back
pam: um, hold on before reopening... beta might need update?
pam: um, no, they don't
pam: umich testing eh?
pam: updated ucla.w.n to head and cannot reproduce bug 5387
pam: verrry nice. we always stay at the mirage. we like the volcano.
pam: wanna borrow some dead kenedies?
pam: wanna go ahead and ask?  I'd rather do it on the channel
pam: was the umic mod_webapp bug fixed d'ye think?
pam: wasn't there a comment that the slowdown happened recently and if so how can we account for that?
pam: we can do our meeting whenever
pam: we can sure give it a shot
pam: we gotta do it one way or another
pam: we have AACD mtg in 2 hrs?
pam: we have a spec for customizable agreement forms
pam: we just have to upgrade them to 3.0.1 release
pam: we just need to go thru the spec process...
pam: we must buy more coffee
pam: we need to figure out a way USC can do some of their fancy 200+ item reservations without cloggin up webcheckout
pam: we probably need timesheet set up for UIUC 2nd install 
pam: we were talkinga bout art center
pam: we're all blowing off the onshore xmas party this year
pam: we're getting ready to be testable here ....
pam: we're not upgrading to 2.0.7 anymore
pam: webcheckout center I believe
pam: webcheckout is a tricky beast!
pam: well gee whiz, craigl is out today
pam: well, call me prior I guess
pam: were you able to open the file Joel Inden sent?
pam: what do you expect to see when you add organization to the search results
pam: what else you may mean by settable I'm not sure
pam: what happened?
pam: what is the funky thing that happened?
pam: what tone, gentle reminder, feigned ignorance, user-bitchslap?
pam: what was the return on line time please?
pam: what we saw with ucb was the confluence of two bugs and the fact that they have been editing their department names.
pam: what's UCB status?
pam: what's up with media sheet in the chapman XLS
pam: what?
pam: what?? where!?
pam: whats wrong?
pam: when?
pam: where are you staying?
pam: where do you work at depaul?
pam: which customer?
pam: which we can jack up arbitrarily
pam: who are the big-wigs Eric is schmoozing?
pam: who do i email at UCLA about upgrade
pam: who do you think you are, craig brozefsky?
pam: why is he sending so many filees
pam: wicked
pam: will send to support
pam: woot, thanks
pam: yah, just file it
pam: yah, on one you did yah
pam: yah, probably jesse's....
pam: yah, release notes require revision
pam: yah, that might be nice... can you save it out as comma-sep?
pam: yah, well, sorry I can't help
pam: yah, why not
pam: yah... 
pam: yah?
pam: yeah 
pam: yeah fake reservation, note the CK_ID on the bug
pam: yeah he sux
pam: yeah i just gotta rebuild some indices
pam: yes
pam: yes I did, twice even
pam: yes, did you see my email?
pam: yes, did you see the umich instance is back
pam: yes, didn't you see my email to evergreen, cc'd support?
pam: yes, it's supposed to work that way...
pam: yes, merci
pam: yes, proof of concept for them
pam: yessum
pam: you are such a harsh task-mistress!
pam: you available for that chat today?
pam: you bet
pam: you can log in and change it back if you like
pam: you can preview my changes to the group screen on pliskin
pam: you don't need to retest those in 3.0 if you don't have time
pam: you got the tester orientation right?
pam: you have to dig for bugs now eh? :)
pam: you here ?
pam: you here?
pam: you know about all the goodies like webcheckout projex file and all the patron contact infos, yes?
pam: you might email all these parties and see if things are ok or not
pam: you might have to re-log-in
pam: you need to check if those are really two types or if they are displaying twice
pam: you need to get the buglist straight on the 2.0.10 stuff
pam: you said:
pam: you should just be trying to manage their expectations as to what the priorities are
pam: you should talk to craig L 
pam: you upstairs?
pam: you want another update then?
pam: you want it now?

person and invoice are both wcof-entities, and we assume they exist along that continuum contaiing wcof-entity, even tho they are radically different things to the outside world.  That continuum is not an absolute semantic continuum, and need notbe.  It is simply one hich facilitates the organization of our code
person being you
person could make a query that returns a text file listing the hours entries and they couldjust use it in the notepad
person definitely existed at time of fault
person deleted perhaps?
person detail admin tab needs help too
person detail, resource type, resource
person employee data, later
person group allocation wco_log station ticket
person import is done dutr

poly, please be more spcific
poly: I already documented that
poly: I have a fix for the figure issue you raised
poly: I think that Gimp will save as a GIF, but you need to set the image type as Indexed
poly: SAIC has over a hundred rtypes, that's too much for a popup 8)
poly: btw, I lied when I said the image could be any format... it wants to be .gif due to limitations in preheat
poly: doc seems to be building fine
poly: don't be absurd
poly: don't worry
poly: excellent
poly: for change parent type, she just wasn't familiar with the word parent type I think
poly: if we remove it for 2.0 its just for a week or two
poly: if you're not getting that, you are having javascript rpoblems, and I can only assume you're using opera ?
poly: included where?
poly: it happens on hitting commit from checkout or reservation  pages
poly: it's cute, in fact, and rather unlikely to change much over time
poly: just keep trying, prep is being really slow right now
poly: move to a different parent type will immediate put them on the find rtype screen, targetted mode4
poly: no
poly: no!!!!
poly: oh excellent
poly: oh, that's wierd... I though PINs were org specific
poly: or are you doing the ref section?
poly: problem?
poly: that might be a good place to link to the problem
poly: that's fine... I don't object to that little scren shot
poly: there's a very useful timeline thingie I added too
poly: they'll get a confirmation page for their *last* checkout or res, rather than the one they are actually working on
poly: they're probably all set the same, but can be subsequntly changed ...
poly: well, you can can often by what attributes it has
poly: what exactly did you do before it went down? we've been trying to capture this bug in action
poly: woah, you changed the style there quite a bit -- background color on section titles!
poly: you have a doc bug
poly: you have to make a location first
poly: you might alreayd have that in there... I need to re-review
poly: you said AFTER you clicked done
poly: you should then be takien to the rtype search screen
poly: you writing glossary for it?

raph's mother was a teenage valley girl
raph, also, the OpenNAP networks are just as good as the official one
raph, but you fixed that by properly opening up your relaying on queso
raph, can you set up mail archiving for webco-devel?
raph, do you have any cigarettes? :)
raph, don't do it now tho
raph, go fix a server or something... we're talking here
raph, gotta be on site baby, gotta mmke sure the machine pops back up
raph, it's not your fixation with kurt v. that i'm worried about
raph, leave a ping running in the background and see if it happens
raph, ok, if HR forbids you to create users, how come I still have root?
raph, too
raph, try again
raph, we should have a working buzzer now
raph, what the hell is that?
raph, what you need to do is find out how to tell it to use a single IP address for socket connections originating from that box
raph, yah
raph: : sorry I dont know
raph: I don't care if it don't get shit hits a month
raph: I dunno... can you wait 1.5 weeks or so? is it in already?
raph: I was told it would be a few more weeks on friday, no less
raph: Um, well, I don't know what the insurance implications
raph: actually, angela's going to integrate what we gave her with a bunch of other stuff, making up a 'web manual'
raph: and I would aks you to do it again too
raph: bill gets those
raph: but that would have to be today or else after hours because work starts tomorrow AFAIK
raph: can you open up port 22 to relleno please
raph: correct
raph: do you still have my eminem cd?

raph: maybe no time next week either
raph: my car
raph: naw aw, i just went there

raph: speaking of deflowered and bled and stuff, how's your kitty cat?
raph: still no mail here, btw
raph: sure...
raph: that is just misconfiguration
raph: then what i should do bout it?
raph: there was a reason 8)
raph: try ssh-ing into relleno and doing something
raph: we're using ftp to drop html files on puerco for the project site
raph: well, if you guys like, you could do a try at moving over the system and I coudl see if it comes up properly... and if not, we move back...
raph: whats going on with the connectivity?
raph: where should i start
raph: wussy, lame ass
raph: yeah a cracked version of illustrator
raph: yeah... theoretically :)
raph: yes dear, but only if you wash up afterwards
raph: yes, which is no different than what you are trying to do.  I'm not talking about changing headers, I'm talking about changing the way it opens the sending sockt
raph: you are not making sense now with this spamming shit
raph: you'll get blocked!
raph: you'll pardon me for doubting that we can have the precise system swapped into place with no problems ... that's oracle, webobjects, solaris, etc...
raph: your dorkdom is showing

rbleib nobody has asked me to setup the sites.. so I don't have ips.
rbleib!!!
rbleib, shit, I can givve youa  new address for that
rbleib, who fixed it.. me or you? I just did ndc restart on ns
rbleib: 'reportbug netbase'
rbleib: 2.4 at least has the -r or --recursive arg
rbleib: Admins does drill drilling equipment bear the whole time?
rbleib: Do developers bore drillings in admins with drilling equipment?
rbleib: Gcc is a folders, i.e., nnmh:outbox is what I use
rbleib: I brought it up in vi but didn't change naything... I have in the past...but I'm not longer certain that queso is where the change should be made anymore...
rbleib: I don't think you yet grok the meaning of a downtime window
rbleib: I don't understand why you query for 0.* at all!
rbleib: I made no promises on clusterability
rbleib: I think its fine...
rbleib: I think they problem is that he lost the password for that account awhile back and could not upgrade his .forward
rbleib: I'll have him call th eoffice for anew password sometime
rbleib: I'll tell him to ask for you, his name is Don.
rbleib: Or do holy admins largebored drillings in the equipment bore?
rbleib: actually, I th8ink ssh *is* open ssh on debian
rbleib: and I think he asked me to get it changed for him, but I forgot
rbleib: any downtime outside maint windows is significant... we have to change our attitudes
rbleib: aren't some of our consultants on mediaone?
rbleib: check the mail... so long as the 'sender' and 'from' address are set to hostmaster, it should work
rbleib: did that come out of your head or a dictionary?
rbleib: do yo know how to get a custom icon onto the onShore Atalk Server?
rbleib: do you know anything about that monitor in the hall?
rbleib: doh! that was me! on the lambda alias
rbleib: don't you know how to submit bugs against pkgs?
rbleib: funny, the openssh pkg has been out a while...
rbleib: halak
rbleib: hey, sorry...
rbleib: hit the net, solaris multihome interface
rbleib: hmm?
rbleib: hows it going, dude?
rbleib: huh
rbleib: i dont' seem to have it... odd
rbleib: if so, then it must be something about the SMTP envelope... ugh...
rbleib: ifup -a does it
rbleib: is it a sucky monitor?  josh seems content
rbleib: it has nothing to do with debain I think
rbleib: it walks you thru
rbleib: it will be MP3ized but you have to promise to buy it if you like the mp3z
rbleib: just go in nslookup and see what the NS records for 224.209.in-add.arpa is
rbleib: last I checked it was ok... hum
rbleib: like I said, check the web
rbleib: morning to you!
rbleib: no, 0.X is meaningless... you just want 8x.224.209.in-addr.arpa
rbleib: nope
rbleib: often happens, say, during big download
rbleib: please do!
rbleib: probably it isn;'t it passive mode and the firewall is saying no...
rbleib: probably...
rbleib: right, if sendmail considers you trusted
rbleib: scroll back, been done
rbleib: shoot, I think there is some way you can tell Solaris that all connects it open us a given address
rbleib: so are you guys having any luck knocking out bugs?
rbleib: so the best thing to do would be to reset the password, and I'll fill him in.
rbleib: so you have to make sure the Sender is set properly
rbleib: solaris device names
rbleib: sorry to distract but is gnats fixed?
rbleib: sorry to hear that
rbleib: stopid
rbleib: stopit
rbleib: than improve your search criteria
rbleib: thanks
rbleib: that doesn't mean I want someone reading my private files!
rbleib: that's the orso mix
rbleib: the issue now is, which is dumber, a software profesional, or a computer scientist
rbleib: the root servers should tell you who owns 209.in-addr.arpa, and then that server should say who owns 224.209.in-addr.arpa, etc
rbleib: they gotta know UI java in browser stuff--- nothing too fancy
rbleib: to lefty there
rbleib: uh, here does the login prompt ceom from?
rbleib: uncomfortable with what?
rbleib: unless the owners of 224.209.in-add.arpa are doing zone delegation to us for 206.224.X, then what we put in our name server won't make a  bit of difference
rbleib: very good
rbleib: we luv you!
rbleib: we'll see what you approve of later tonite :)
rbleib: we're talking about jservlet, not jrun, for this lind java stuff I was asking about
rbleib: well, lets hear from HR then...
rbleib: well, we can drop the mirror anyhow
rbleib: well, yeah, send one to me as you would to the internic
rbleib: what is the phone system URL?
rbleib: what's up with www.onshore.com?
rbleib: with immediate availability -- contract, hourly, whatever...
rbleib: yeah
rbleib: yeah I quoted 8 hours... but its on a cluster
rbleib: yeah, IIRC
rbleib: yeah, just submit a wishlist bug
rbleib: yeah... wierd
rbleib: yes, I get timed out when lag is high
rbleib: yes, but surely you are able to send the spoofed mail to yourself rather than the nic, examine the headers, etc
rbleib: you can just craig the root pass if he needs it
rbleib: you feel a bit less depressed today?
rbleib: you only think yo need that information.
rbleib: yup
rbleib: yuppers!
rbleib:huh... well, taht's where I learned all I know...

resource detail screen the reservation will still appear as the Next User.
resource event needs a new key
resource fornication is not to be encouraged
resource imporrrts are such a PITA
resource inherits from i-s, s-s:m-e and schedulable
resource instance oriented I mean
resource is fine
resource is scheduled to be picked up for a pending reservation.
resource level is the term they use in cinapps
resource log? is that the history rsrc sched data?
resource management is such a sucky task to write software for
resource metadata?
resource not being resource-type?
resource objects are not changing significantly
resource on it that is scheduled on another allocation that takes place
resource policy number 1
resource right, or is it rtype?
resource room a1 deleted - no probs there
resource schedule doesn't load
resource schedule yes
resource schedules are almost done
resource summary doesn't work for reservations
resource to holding is 1-1
resource type Heater -- Heater -- Heater -- Heater -- Heater -- Heater -- Heater -- Heater -- Heater -- Heater -- Heater
resource type heater is white in the bar huh
resource type hierarchy indexing is so uber horked
resource type missing oid!  weeyad
resource type policies, person detail
resource type tree done
resource type, checkout center or organization
resource types are meant to be global
resource types are retarded
resource usufruct?
resource wizard sucks
resource!
resource, location, allocation eg will all have a 'schedule' mixin
resource-authorizations are stritly limited to wether a person can use this object or that object
resource-biblio eg
resource-conflicts needs some work
resource-detail screen
resource-detail shows last 10 checkouts
resource-detail-editable screen to be presented and then other
resource-events, alloc-core and alloc-status are the nexus of changes
resource-level-limiits?
resource-status
resource-status and resource-current-allocation do not jive for unserialized resources
resource-status is messed up
resource-status just calls schedule-status 
resource-status needs a better docstring perhaps
resource-take-offline-take-forever
resource-type is not descended from metadata-entity
resource-type object that is
resource-type-validation
resource-type? are we taking about the same bug?
resource-usage hangs it
resource.lisp that is
resource.lisp...
resource?
resourceInsepctor has a naughty -- Update button wrapped down
resource_event.resource_oid, allocation.allocation_oid
resource_events without allocations
resource_metadata.meta_string = SONY
resource_metadata.primary_oid = 22
resource_metadata.subtype = MANUFACTURER
resources
resources are back in circulation at that point, so no worries for taking offline
resources are still resources...
resources are such a small part of a much bigger picture :)
resources are there but sparse. For example, there is no video rtype, and the monitors list is very short.
resources area, or on the confirmation screens.
resources don't have a root_oid field lying around do they?
resources for importing on their server, should stage that and then
resources going to the wrong location
resources have a lot of info for them
resources have lots of stinking metadata
resources like #03245 and #04825.  We are in the process of 
resources live at a cc .. you have to create some there
resources that are components of other resources should not show up in the circulomator
resources which are contained cannot be checked out or reserved on their own
resources without condition notes work fine though
resources, with the pickup time and return time set in the very near

right now I have them editable ont he checkout-return field and in the pre-confirm screen
right now I need to lay down, I'm totally faded here
right now I think the issue is determining how far we want to take it in this development round.
right now I'm feeling very divorced from whatever jesse has in his head and it's making it diffiult for me to be effective
right now I'm in a maze of angle brackets, tbh
right now I'm looking at a rtype with different parent type listed on find rtype results vs rtype detail -- that's in the bug
right now I'm not feeling very optimistic
right now I'm on the console of it but I just get the no packets issue
right now I'm working on some index table maint issues
right now I'm working ont he machinery for deifning templates and the supporting information like From address, Subject header and the like.

right now i'm reading up on postgres
right now i've got that still-a-little-hung-over-and-i-ate-too-many-eggs-and-drank-too-much-coffee feeling
right now indirect indexes don't see changes untilc ommit phase, and non-indirect indexes which have explicite calles to replace-index-data do.  That's gotta end IMO.
right now is fine..
right now is probably fine..
right now it displays Name ID and Affiliation columns; should I change that?
right now it is grabbing everything from unsbale by default
right now it is not possible to have all 4 at the same time
right now it is setting status to :deleted, which would not even be a valid :status anymore
right now it is, what I am doing is making html-element a subclass of html-view and passing it along that way, as opposed to using extended output recording streams
right now it only supports full-day
right now it seems like the only way to do that is quit the browser
right now it would just take a notepad and sharp eyes
right now it's a set of fixed fields plus an alist of variable fields
right now it's called campbell
right now it's hardcoded to or
right now it's just me...
right now it's like crashes are part of the routine... like i can get about 3 effects transformations in Peak before it nukes the system and i have to reboot
right now it's only haxor customizable
right now it's quite easily gotten around
right now it's safe to assume that there is one and only one backend, but thats not really a safe assumption
right now it's under some underpass somewhere in indiana, in a burned, crushed carton next to a rolled over ups truck
right now its the schedulator on the head
right now jk owns all
right now me too tired to wrry about licenses, must sleep
right now on debian the c-l-c translations are done in wco-framework.system; I wonder if things needed for runtime should be moved to wcof-config.lisp -- thoguhts?
right now on jesse's instance I can go to bibilio edit and edit fields...
right now other people are reading the irc channel and thinking to themselves that we are philistines
right now that would have no ramifications
right now the applet is having a hard enough time distinguishing right clicks for showing alloc details and to move the timeline
right now the appt is set for 1:30
right now the ass-ton of umich framework customizations are all in one file
right now the biggest bug in 1.8.5 is caused by desynchronization btw the scheduler cache and the database
right now the confirmation screens have been extended for the selectio nof these things and the patron...
right now the major entities are all symbols, but all the newer and minor entities are keywords
right now the problem I have is in set-schedule I think and I need to get into the office and try and get that squared away
right now the remaining P1s are trivil
right now the slow queries are the allocation search
right now the wife is on tour with fischerspooner, a band she does makeup for
right now there is a big button on the left panel that says 'edit with scheduler...'
right now there is a global event dispatch, the applet however uses the whole OSConnection mechanism to register as a listener to a particular object
right now they are a bit drifted
right now they are defaulting to the first in the list, which is probaboy wrong
right now they are hosted on gopher
right now they are mere warnings
right now they are none too enticing
right now they are warnings
right now they could have Somtime around the turn of the century in that field.
right now those days don't even show up on the timeline, so you can imagine the havoc when today doesn't exist
right now we fault in basically all current and future events for a resource when we pop that up, and in the process we gather alot of information we don't need right away
right now we would get into trouble say if jserv was running for some reason
right now, for that update, it's running some stuff I don'tthink it needs to run...
right now, it would be me and dag
right now, it's the big search-form macro that generates the find forms
right now, shicks and alex are the only ones that I know of hitting unserialized resources with any consistency
right now, the schedule-nodes are presented in a list, sorted on their start-time
right now, we have wco, wcof, imo, and sql
right now, what you provide there is sorta maisql specifica
right now, when I take a snapshot
right now, you end up with multiple root rtypes with the name Sound at webCheckout, because it cached rtypes based on the organization

right, as a consultant
right, assuming people are literate
right, ayres?
right, because he is trying extra hard now
right, because the search-form is not seeing the value of the Name field
right, bug went away after a minute right?
right, but I need to do docs
right, but I need to make sure that my cmucl ignores the other de
right, but M-u works hah?
right, but applets are different.
right, but didn't you deprecate the 'amount prop on invoices?
right, but how big, exactly, is the population they use for determining premium?
right, but i can't seem to get BODY to know about 'argument-list or 'basic-definition
right, but if it's all subs then no harm done
right, but if you kill -15 it, then it doesn't close the db connection
right, but in the default demo load, brenda is never authorized, so maybe demo-create-authorizations isnt' actually called?
right, but it should have
right, but it's all new fancy stuff
right, but no one talks about class B etc, anymore.  that's passe
right, but not for 2.0.x right?
right, but say he finds a bug in whatever we got to them yesterday or whenever that was
right, but that is conditionalized on c-l0c 
right, but the Acc makes me think they are accessories
right, but the Resource object has no knowledge ofthe Scheduler at this point.
right, but the toe hits.  i figured out this morning i can point my toe down and get out, tho
right, but they exploit the brilliance of the programmers, poor guys
right, but we hgave to pay for future work with it
right, but we'll just have to make do
right, but why didnt it page?
right, but...
right, by boog i meant my own idiocy :)
right, cause it's not quoted
right, cleansing!
right, comments are confusing, like FIXME move this , etc.
right, completely blank slate
right, craigb did it
right, didn't know about that, even
right, easy
right, exaclt.
right, exactly what I thought it was
right, figured that out
right, find some resources, stuff them into a calendar, then pick some of them into a checkout.
right, for change logging or something?
right, forgot to call ensure-directories-exist on the head
right, got it
right, he thinks he's searching for all people with the last name miller
right, hence my statement we need to record EXACT time of cvs update in projex
right, hence the sql:select
right, how do you know i'm not studiously looking at porno
right, however I can imagine that the assessment of a late fee might still be apropriate
right, i believe that means resource-status is working proper
right, i don't care about 1.8.1
right, i dont' want my computer tied up for 4 weeks trying to decode an email...
right, i figured that by looking at code
right, i followed alex's exact description of the bug
right, i forgot the part about duration
right, i forgot you need to be able to enter the account at checkout time and have it apply to invoices
right, i have that, but are we making this timeline in the am or something?
right, i knew it was something really straightforward and obvious
right, i know that
right, i know the password
right, i saw it's a slot now
right, i tested that and it works fine
right, i want to know what lyn thinks it should do
right, i was just doing it on a machine that didn't have psql
right, i'll call the Don
right, i'm going on what i'm hearing from ayres
right, i'm just saying beware of it becoming disfunctional
right, i'm working on that
right, i-dep is worse about paying bills than i am
right, ic
right, if patron chagnes, flush all known rtype policies
right, internal
right, is that the forms issue? or something else... 
right, it gets set to weakest class if nil
right, it goes in and out as 16bit unicode prolly
right, it resends itself every time you launch an .exe after you get infected
right, it should at least identify whether it's a server issue or a printer issue
right, it should be more assertive though
right, it should just bring up the find-person screen
right, it's called from the server side no?
right, it's in our handler
right, it's so much easier to shoot baby animals if you've already incapacitated them with a baseball bat first
right, it's the woody pass
right, its NYU
right, josh is late this morning
right, josh is, like, late this morning
right, josh?
right, kevin mentioned somethign about that
right, leave mckay, fuck them other g's
right, legitimacy and morality thru technical performance
right, let's just throw them out...
right, like proof-of-concept sorta
right, load syracuse into evergreen :)
right, looking at that
right, make sense
right, makes sense
right, me spell foneticlee
right, much better
right, no SAIC rtypes have descriptions
right, no clients on support list
right, no gross tablescans every 5 minutes
right, not interesting to us, but very interesting to them
right, now I'm killing all my orphaned X windows and starting again
right, now reload the screen
right, of course
right, ok
right, ok so that is a bug that frozen update-to-frozen breaks on 1.8.7 iirc
right, ok.
right, okay 
right, old standby
right, only if mark count == capacity
right, opus
right, opus?
right, or else make a warning
right, or false, or nil, or whatever
right, periods of time
right, plus no shipping
right, rgiht
right, right
right, right.
right, right...
right, roles are persistent too
right, same as you would add auths on the authorizationS tab
right, same fo me.
right, seems to be going ok on URI atm
right, select is like schizo
right, sent
right, should the time update or not?
right, since we NEVER get paid for gigs anymore
right, so Lefty can just pull an ObjectStream trick
right, so don't ... instead
right, so there is one known tag per active release
right, so we treate a person with status :deleted as mearly inactive?
right, so what does the word lead mean in that context
right, so, explain this...
right, some are more dangerous than others
right, something is calling circulation policy without properly specifying an org or loc
right, sorry
right, that is fine
right, that much is pretty clear
right, that one reports several, but now to fix them
right, that should do it
right, that was Moscow on the Hudson
right, that was my plan
right, that was my thinking 
right, that was my thought
right, that was the point
right, that worked. thanks Fitz!
right, that's a question for jesse or craig
right, that's easy
right, that's it
right, that's my plan
right, that's my point...
right, that's pretty clear
right, that's the nature of the bug that I really care about
right, that's what I was thinking actually
right, that's what i need input regardign
right, that's what i thought
right, that's what i usually do
right, thats why it needs to be a pin form
right, the 'backq'
right, the containing page is the find-resources screen
right, the idea of replacing should not be crammed into 1.8 please
right, the local stufdf
right, the name in that sense
right, the policy is being applied even if it isn't set
right, the proxy env setting is in root's .bash_profile or .bashrc
right, the record origin, and so on
right, the server code never need know about storage
right, then off to the wco-support inbox :P
right, then they need WCOF::EXPIRE-RESERVATION events if they don't have them
right, there are maybe 6 fewer mixin classes in imho now
right, they didn't want to open anything on the firewall aside from ssh i guess
right, they don't
right, they were just downloaded as mp3 then ripped to redbook
right, those args are passed directly to import-people
right, typing a name in the box doesn't hork it 
right, um, let me see...
right, was just looking at em
right, we dont even agree on metaprocess, let alone process
right, we gotta get .deb-ified for that to happen
right, we had a conversation about this before
right, we need a new box for ASP
right, we'd miss the midnight run
right, we'll put it into the pipeline
right, we're all all over the place
right, we're trying to find the ideal here...
right, we've been doing that and recording the results
right, web of trust
right, well flippy trianlges don't deserve a whole chapter :)
right, well i think 3070 can attest to how well it gets handled...
right, well if the resource gets into the checkout, the accessories are in there
right, well remember i had originally put this as a production instance bug
right, well... i guess that doesn't really remove any functionality really...
right, what about -depends and -g?
right, what if expiring broke
right, what is pickup time for the reservation
right, what's that?
right, whatever dude
right, when that component is brought into the session, no?
right, which is why i'm confused
right, yes, the notes I have already clearly tell you they are putting holding data in the local field
right, you give him a chronicle of something and then tell him to recite
right, you need to supply the organization as well.
right, you would do it in a more lispy way
right, you're using default
right,right
right-o
right-o not like your precious objc fruit man
right-o, im off home ways 
right-o.
right-o.  I have a test to finalize
right-o.  Ill get on the function as soon as I test migration against saic
right-o. covert action on Dodson and Bouwman's parts.
right-oh, can you point me at how to get at them?
right-wing talk shows are like my favorite place to get news and opinions these days
right.
right.  However if there is only a late fee on the main invoice with an account code, the invoice will NOT be considered payed
right.  Im told that meand Resource type
right.  There will be separate, general accounts -- one for si, one for devel
right.  We will prolly just sleep here tonight
right.  but thats not me connected to it
right.  snow crash doesn't suck donkey geek worshipping balls
right. Eric said it referred to the meeting they had at Ebay about 1 hour into the downage
right. I think you should use a 'ScrollPane' wrapped around the timeline bit.
right. It enables the Interlibrary Loan departments to fill requests for items not carried locally.
right. Step numbers are the only ones I've done that with
right. demo is 186
right..
right.. the 'reflection' was crufted on at a later date.
right.. what should happen is time sync always be on, running less frequently
right...
right... 'kay
right... hopefully in a way that is palatable to a wide range of people... e.g., not caught up in jargon
right... removing those other lines is proper, you're saying... ok
right... so put in the formulas too
right... thus the queries that return objects ...
right... well this is that client who wants a Audit on their existing firewall... before it goes live.. i am just trying to compile a list of all the things I want to check.
right... you, the sysadmin, can *opt* to use that, but you don't have to
right.... we are talking about the city here. maybe in 10 years ill get $5.00
right6
right: I see it being able to either create or overlay
right: exactly
right: so you interpret...
right: that is the solution
right: those parts are pretty heavily untested
right: you would have to, in the first case, no longer be able to use a raw 'typecase' to smell the type--or at least, add another clause for surrogates that deals with the type appropriately.
right?
right? because the errors when you hit them in cmucl lisp stuff would have source refs properly

rimmer
rimpoche did USC ever install the RAM in their server?
rimpoche did you see the note in webco-devel about fixing overlaps?
rimpoche is on the head
rimpoche mentioned somethign but he was not clear as to what h ement 
rimpoche: 99.9% of the time you want the file in CVS, not the file locally there....
rimpoche: I dunno, cvs -qn up should tell you
rimpoche: are wco-dump and wco-restore supposed to be run within wcof-sessions or not?
rimpoche: are you still here?
rimpoche: btw, if you update beta, pls announce to webco-beta list
rimpoche: can you check on the UIUC problem reported this AM ?
rimpoche: can you do me a favor and setup the media warehouse schedule
rimpoche: congrats!
rimpoche: did you happen to email rik back?
rimpoche: do you know roughly how long it took?
rimpoche: do you need help?
rimpoche: don't follow; HTML better than what?
rimpoche: don't forget to turn off debug
rimpoche: email sent to webco-support about the containiner node not found
rimpoche: for projex, exactly
rimpoche: from the email
rimpoche: go for it
rimpoche: got time now?
rimpoche: how is dog?
rimpoche: ignore that
rimpoche: is it still in this state?
rimpoche: it all went ok?
rimpoche: just put all the hacks in 1 file and leave it around somewhere
rimpoche: just start up the server or whatever
rimpoche: ok, call me with the passwords
rimpoche: ok, that should do it
rimpoche: ok, you need to run 
rimpoche: remember to set milestones on yer bugs btw
rimpoche: setup.sh is cannot be the problem unless you are not able to load given pkgs at all
rimpoche: so do i have to create a session to run wco-dump?
rimpoche: stil waiting?
rimpoche: surely
rimpoche: that first stop we stopped at but didn't go in was, according to a thai website, perhaps the supeior stop.  They did list the place we went into, which was Chinese incidently
rimpoche: that's coolio, i'll just keep piling crap on josh til he cries :) love the pain
rimpoche: the build on clotho is threaded
rimpoche: this is a 2.0.10 instnace right?
rimpoche: umich.w.n is dead...
rimpoche: we would have to look the person up by name and , failing that, buy barcode
rimpoche: were you one of the lucky 1000?
rimpoche: what file merge problem?
rimpoche: what's the thing your fixing?
rimpoche: whats up?
rimpoche: yes
rimpoche: you around?
rimpoche: you coming in today?
rimpoche: you got login and all you need?
rimpoche: you in office?
rimpoche: you migrating ucb to your instance first?
rimpoche: you need to find the real cause... check global-schema-version

rob, I really can't tell now
rob, Solaris eh?
rob, because my DSL is dropping like 30%
rob, how goes the sec policy?
rob, other solutions include putting OpenBSD boxes at clients using IPSec as well
rob, start grubbing

rob: IIC todo item to be added --  determine weekly maintenance window which sysadmin can opt to use for regular maint duties on our servers

rob: are you making any progress on the Verio issues?

rob: we should pose as SBA and get a report filed with them regardingt he packet droppage
rob: what is SBA's feelings about verio?
rob: where are we on the relaying problem.
rob: where are you having blockage? calling sba? calling verio?
rob: will do
rob: wish i knew
rob: written by craigy
rob: yeah
rob: yer the sysadmin, not me bro :)
rob: you might say something like, We have identified a mishaving router on our upstream provider's backbone.  They have been notified of the problem.  This router is causing packet loss, which we beleive is the cause of the network slowdown accessing our servers you may have experienced.  blah blah blha

see, I DO get the close the bug 8)
see, I can taunt Opus too
see, I can't comment on any of that
see, I can't even spell inflate right, so I'm on the road to success
see, I don't think josh updated wco-beta at end of day
see, I still think fsync is stubbornly refusing to go off
see, I think authorization is action-oriented, not page oriented
see, I'm going the other direction there too, the vaio laptops are pretty open since they release drivers for the YAMAHA sound chip
see, IRC sux
see, all auths are based on where you are logged into
see, available-resources was basically just for finding resources for reservations, so it's check for availability is purely within the context of making a reservation.
see, bald guy!
see, but for the player to decrypt, they all have to have the key
see, for instance add-person is listed in section 4.2.2 as a particular system authorization
see, i asked you about this the other day and then figured i wouldn't say anything because of the price
see, i did it
see, i think my parents should be encouraging him, because when they keep trying to get him to come home he just tries harder to freak them out
see, it doesn't matter
see, it's gotta be seomthing i totally loved in the 80s 
see, it's phase 2
see, my problem is my relay accepts but the mail doesn't get there
see, null kinda means unknown in some db designers head
see, ok, lilo can either bein the MBR or not
see, once you have most of the process automated, it's much easier for me to pick out things that need to be automated...
see, outbound should be easy... do you use relayhost?
see, pretty stupid
see, she is saying it shouldn't be automated
see, that is in he repository, your machine is different than ours so if you commit code you willbreak everyone elses setup
see, that is what I mean about these vi users!
see, that just spells failure...
see, that one is not in my TAGS file
see, that's why it's so critical we can get the failure rate down
see, thats the stuff I'm saying to assume it's all t here already
see, the applet needs to do a date addition every time the time thumbs settle on a new point
see, the benefit of the CVS thing is that you can add notes to the file there and we can work at the same time
see, the find alloc screen is a bit diff...
see, the problem is I review the document as one who knows the nuts and bolts
see, the system thinks the hardware clock is in UTC, so it's adjusting by 7 hours
see, the thing is, if we are forced to, say, port to Allegro or whatever, alex was just saying she doesn't have any budget for that
see, there are a hundred fucking ways to come across this shit
see, there is a method to his madness
see, thereis no FROM table
see, they have these attachments known as wings which enable them to displace air in such a way that they are able to counter-act gravity
see, they probably want a PIN level, only PIN my if my auth is no good
see, they use the same riff
see, this is where I see more similarity: the idea of roles
see, while the rest of the world is waiting for Lisp to come, I'll keep writing in Lisp
see, you always wanna propogate more settings...
see, you are getting to the bottom of it....
see, you can't see me
see, you made it 1.8.1, it got fixed.
see, you're so formal and we're so informal :)
see... no kathleen on irc!
see...there went adam
see: The fucking scheduler is all fucked up again, so I fucking fixed it.
see: ok, then perhaps I can rebuild saic CMUCL version with some debugging turned on and update saic
see?
see?  it's not on my calendar
see? Just that easy.
see? black celebration.
see? everything works
see? got ya
see? i didn't pick up
see? i rest my case
see? i'm wittier than you suspect
see? it worked
see? opus likes to be abused.
see? see me working?

seems like it could be handled easily enough tho
seems like it could be resolved into a version of the find checkouts reports pretty trivially
seems like it should be pretty quick
seems like it wants both wco-framework and wcof
seems like it was rebooted

seems like it would only take 30mins at max
seems like it's >= 50%

since that fax machine is trashed...
since that happened a while ago and I have no log of the install, I can't say

since that just makes it easier fo rus to ship up to date docs

since that's what homeboy sez...
since the 20th
since the VAST majority of calls don't require it's existence
since the adage of good network programming is ignore what you don't understand
since the allocation does not exist
since the bug is actually that the allocations GET stuck, not that they ARE stuck

since the determination of Set or Strike and thus Accopany or  Pickup is taken care of in the task type
since the duration of the allocation is fixed to be the default checkout length

since the fax line is back, pls send that fax to ucla for me, thanks!!
since the fields are sprayed over 7 columns

since the instruction is 32 bits, and theregister is too.
since the invoice is only marked payed in the ussage fee portion
since the ips changed I got into demo via the onshored website
since the issue here is quite simple but hard to solve:
since the last time an EWOULDBLOCK happened
since the paragraph doesn't convey that very well, I suggest just deleting it and rewriting it
since the quick import doesn't compare any properties.
since the regime ends before the date????
since the result-sets are property oriented
since the slower the migration function, the less of a social life i am permitted during release-week
since the spawning?
since the stuck checkouts are stuck in the UI only
since the taliban took over
since the user can just cancel the reservation by hand, and it happens very infrequently
since the white board has slid down behind a desk, it probably is
since then I've had it refilled and doing two a day for the last two weeks tho
since then he has gotten much worse
since there are 50000 ways to cache data in webcheckout you never know if it's cached in an editing context, an imho element or some custom hashtable somebody just whipped up 
since there are a few bugs that hang off that
since there is no UI: Admin component
since there is no particular state for ONLINE
since there is none, he will have to admit he's getting sidetracked
since there is not route to our network from saic network
since there is only one stop-time recorded per resource
since there will have to be at least 1 more 2.0.x migration before 3.0 migration
since these are for them locations but for us just things that affect the circulation characteristics
since these reservatitons can be killed by hand
since they are EST too
since they are all debian linux boxen 
since they are all on a FAT fs, I am unable to export them via the webserver because there is no executable bit on the dirs
since they are in california and we are hosting their production instance until april or so
since they are in the past
since they are obviously incapable of it
since they are proto-entities
since they are similar
since they are sorta related
since they are symbols interned in keyword pkg, they would be the same object in memory
since they are the ONLY client who even believs that that is what those slots are for
since they are west coast
since they cannot log in
since they did kuwait in 92, thanks to cheney's influence then too
since they had the bright idea to burn underbrush in high winds and stuff
since they have the whole db thing behind them.  Mostly strings and integers
since they have timestamps :)
since they own it
since they paid for that customization
since they should be in 1.7.1 already
since they told pam you guys said it was ok that they have everything under 2 root types
since they will be just getting up into production an dnot fully in it anyhow
since they're ALL BROKEN
since they're not cgi pages
since they're not using it production, poerhaps just import would work fine assuming we had a backup
since they're one to one
since this is media the more natural meaning for type doesn't apply for them
since this is their contract closer
since thunder doesn't have a shadow
since tinderbox phases are in different steps, that's why I'm looking at using a lisp core file
since today is cut-off day for saic
since upgrade costs are lower
since usage fees are not modularized according to sales, that one reference should be removed
since wco:start gets called automagically by the init script and obviously nobody is using the app if it was just started anyway
since we are having folks over for Soprannos manana
since we can derive the balance from the line items
since we can redefine classes at runtime, we don't need to have those things be outside the class
since we can reimport them anyhow
since we can't have all result rows classes be identical
since we can't reprodue at all
since we connect just fine
since we don't do partial restores, that implies writing out an accepted file too, though
since we don't do that in 2.0 there is no point in not meeting availabilty requirements at reservation time
since we don't have any reference for reprots, that's not a big deal
since we don't really use the security stuff, it didn't seem to matter much
since we dont' have fee assessment yet
since we filter them out in the UI anyway
since we gotta do a migration anyways
since we have more memory leak problems then speed problems I would recommend to not do more caching
since we have no interface for managing the list of depts that I know of
since we have no way of sitting here and identifying all the points of configuration that customers might want
since we have other types of data storage now
since we haven't released 1.8.6 yet
since we know it works now
since we no longer have the hierarchy of pclasses
since we only have one persistant store for the data, it wiould appear that an intermediary is not maintaining consistancy
since we only really are building components that are directly useful in webco, we basically have the infrastructure for testing them in wco
since we were basically given a fresh install to play with
since we'd have to do it twice :)
since we're clearly not doing redesign like that in 2.0.x ...
since we're in alpha
since we're not explicitly tracking on a rsrc-by-rsrc basis what needs to be delivered
since we're not planning on using sbcl for 3.1, at least not that I'm aware of 
since we're not tracking inventory, I don't know what the concept return means
since we're still at the point of rejoicing when things actually work...
since we've converted everything to work with the keywords
since we've yet to install webcheckout on a server for them
since when do organizations expire?
since wiether working right or wrong, the edit reservation too early to pickup issue will never cause cannot commit alloc with errors
since yesterday
since you are the guy who gets yanked around most
since you asked...  is it a good thing or a bad thing that with-transient-db can't be used within another with-transient-db ?
since you broke my heart
since you can go there from some of the pages before you're registered
since you can have reservation create, ressie edit N times, pickup, partial return N times, yadda
since you can implement get-property etc. for that surrogate class and, depnding on policy, either replace the surrogate with the real object and continue, or raise and error
since you can't get it from gopher
since you could conceivably wanna reserve it after the return-online date
since you could set the default at the cc level, yet override it for certain resources, and it might get weird
since you could work around it by printing the results frame
since you don't need to have multpile instances of unserialized types
since you had said before the intent of the dump was to express the relation between the objects, we would want ticket-log and circ-policy to have those relations, and not export the :ticket-oid and :rtype-oid properties
since you like live one block away from me
since you spray it on to make the person feel better and have an exceuse for the medic to carry his bag onto the field
since you wanna have that able to tag your wherever you are
since you're cvs enabled now, we could set you up with access to that file too
since you're late
since you're not indexing into it...

sir!
sir, do you still get 'error on splashscreen'?
sir, i cannot write interpreted lisp code at this moment, because i have been switched into technical support mode
sir, with respect to bug 4566, is uof m really supposed to be able to create bibliographic records?
sir. :-)
sircam.
sirconsal sirconsal, let down your pair
sirconsal: I'm really against added complexity at this point, especially in light of trying to get media integration working smoothly.  Can you list some other benefits than printing keywords with the '-' turned into ' ' and the initials capitalized?
sirconsal: do you have example of what entity is done in the way you're recommending and one that isn't ?
sirconsal: ok, but they are not used
sirconsal: so much of the lisp runtime behavior does type checking using the CL type system; I worry about the cost of type checks; you start to risk having complicated checks run just by virtue of method dispatch
sirconsal: surely you can sell the benefit of presentation-types in general a little better than that?
sirconsal: well, we could use the same field order on the detail screens, but I'm not convinced that's the ideal anyway and I don't wanna go there
sirconsalot, btw, bibliographic-record and holding-record used to be part of resource, but now are moved into own classes, i think

so it added a local binding too
so it always poffs itself
so it appears either mary's problem is fixed, or it's localized
so it assumes the name of the instance cited is a local instance on the machine the script is run on
so it can be tail-recursive
so it can learn how you talk
so it can tell when I'm attacking someone I guess
so it can't be shut down
so it can't be the EC thing
so it can't be us, AFAIK
so it comes from the operator... 
so it could be a fuck up from the 3d party package maint
so it could be like that
so it could just be spending most of its time there
so it couldnot spawn the listener process
so it crashes anytime a program tries to write directly to the screen
so it crashes on the equip load
so it didnt' help much :)
so it does
so it doesn't get rammed through you in 10 weeks?
so it doesn't have the GUI like freebirth?
so it doesn't request the policy for every resource
so it doesn't use the proper method
so it don crash no more?
so it don't get pulled
so it downloads the docs from gopher or whatever instead of building them on the box?

so it fixes it to push close time back before midnight?
so it gets all ad hominem oh great master and fucking
so it gets loaded on boot properly
so it goes
so it goes in the living room?
so it got the default
so it got turned back on
so it had to have been fixed by then
so it hangs the apache startup
so it has a special host route rule?
so it has no meaning whatsoever, even for restricted status eg
so it has to be from you
so it impacts some other scheduler problems in the system?
so it is
so it is 2.1 import bug not 2.0.10 export bug
so it is different
so it is filed?
so it is kinda strange you're seeing an infinite loop
so it is missing account codes or dept codes?
so it is not available at all
so it is not finding a class cl-user:bug-category, so it think you are just using a symbol name as shorthan for a field that you would like to select
so it is officialy spring
so it is open for review at your eisure
so it is prolly one of those differences that is changing the behavior of CGI.pm
so it is running now?
so it is safe to update all sources then?
so it is still funny?
so it is written
so it is.  Thanks.
so it isnt recursive
so it iterates thru the loop, refilling the loop as it goes
so it just can't configure itself
so it just grows and grow
so it just went straight to voice mail
so it kinda comes with the territory
so it knows what table to query because it finds it in the class?
so it knows which mailbox to go to
so it loads the dumper data as a big list, frobs, then crams into importer?
so it loads the target sparc compiler, and when that compiler is loaded these cold ops build a bunch of data structurs which are then used to spit out itnernals.h?
so it looks good
so it looks like an organization got deleted, but its employees are still employed
so it looks like the backend is using all the buffers
so it looks likes the serialization error is on the applet end
so it looks more like a dumb terminal now
so it looks sort of like a triangle
so it makes sens
so it may have been tagged as 1.8, but if you snag 1.8 and then type make version, it will read the uncommited file and think it is 1.8beta
so it may never happen
so it might be 8 CST
so it might be good to do that tomorrah in case we need to hack on it a bit
so it might be ok
so it might be waiting for someone to press a key
so it might involve just writing a little app that hosts a document renderer in the same way
so it must be a configable thing
so it must be cached in the EC i guess
so it must not have happened, for we never mocked you ruthlessly!
so it must run setup.sh to install it, then
so it needs testing
so it needs to do the right thing outta the box as it were
so it no work?
so it obviously _is_ reading .cmucl
so it opens up the model for stuff like that easily
so it probably was then
so it replaced the old init with a new one i guess
so it requires hacked clc ?
so it rings one way if it's biz, and nother if it's home.
so it says This policy applies to but the drop down box that says other is not there
so it scrolls across the bottom of Fox News
so it scrolls good, zooms good ?
so it seems kosher
so it seems like 1.7.1 rooted branch, and then merge jesse's changes since release
so it seems like a special case
so it seems like an adam-only phone problem...
so it seems phase 1 involves 1 template, phase 2, 2 additional templates, yes?
so it seems to be a border case
so it should all be clean now
so it should be a join slot then right?
so it should be set to like 17:10 or something
so it should not bump the upstream version at all
so it should really be reservation-advance-limit + max-checkout-reserve-time
so it shouldn't be fucked up any more.
so it shouldn't be somethign that we look at just for fees, but app wide
so it shouldn't come as a suprise, if you read that
so it spreads out
so it sucks
so it thingks theres only one line in the file
so it was
so it was a good day then?
so it was a properly focued pooh
so it was a very special case of not being able to checkout
so it was abad MBR?
so it was easier to find a cancelled reservation in 1.8x
so it was like hey, IRC? I should see what's up at onshored
so it was more like pulled plug from wall and died
so it was more of a clean install than an upgrade for webco
so it was probably an aborted reservation that got patially committed
so it was psoft, eh?>
so it was syr?
so it was the crapple?
so it was very hard to extract
so it wasn't just a hallucination or a big fat lie
so it will have to wait 
so it will likely take the rest of the week I would assume...
so it will no longer be advised to assume patron classes are called this or that, or that the lowest is other
so it won't be a total lie
so it won't matter if the table fills the screen
so it wont take much to push me over the edge
so it works
so it woudl show up on find fines screen
so it would be NPR vs the NWS web forcast maintainer
so it would be dead silly
so it would be like a central european spa for 20-something laptop rokkers
so it would be one file, with repeating title info for each print record perhaps, like iris is
so it would be pretty much just like setting up a new developer instance on hm or prep 
so it would break it down per job
so it would fail out before building the lisp for instance
so it would have to be a saic box
so it would insist on wiping the whole disk
so it would only be 24 sub-subtypes
so it would probably take a few hours
so it would seem there are still bugs in EC caching 
so it wouldn't block the running instance
so it wouldn't have taken much of a breeze to ignite my personal home as well
so it wouldn't set it to NIL
so it'll be 11am on tuesday when i get started 
so it'll happen regardless of the type of import
so it'll know what to do huh?
so it's --enable-helpdesk ?
so it's 1 to many?
so it's 1048576 bytes, no?
so it's 2.0.3 -> 2.0.6 that has problems?
so it's 2_0_maint branch for webco and head for everything else, right?
so it's 77 at ohare right now :)
so it's 9:30 central now, I'll be back in about 90 minutes ok?
so it's a bit different
so it's a defproperties with an additional name for grouping the properties.
so it's a feature that was there then lost
so it's a fuzzy definition
so it's a good match I think ... ok, lets make it so
so it's a good time to upgrade it
so it's a hash keyed on username, value = 0
so it's a little crusty
so it's a pci card n shit?
so it's a session timeout interaction
so it's a sort of coalition
so it's a test bug not a scheduler bug
so it's actually encrypted or just pgp signed?
so it's address isn't really 66.54.200.200 is it
so it's all good
so it's all ready to go, just upgrade them to latest 2.0.x branch?
so it's already fixed and this is an old email or did it happen again?
so it's an executive challenge
so it's an import bug
so it's an in-memory index so we don't even have to do the round trips to the db?
so it's an instance problem
so it's an ordering problem ?
so it's an out of business ISP
so it's basically another drilldown on a different flavor of checkout -- blech...
so it's basically doing everything except creating the allocation
so it's calculating 127 days there
so it's completely unreviewed
so it's conceivable that it generated that result for the luser
so it's current checkoutsw and returned checkouts?
so it's decided finkls
so it's definitely a bug in db-timestring 
so it's dumped
so it's easy for me
so it's edit by hand time!!!!
so it's either a or b
so it's either split 2nd line, some other wierd option, or cell phone for business
so it's failure is distinct from other printable html rendering bits
so it's gnusworthy
so it's good by me
so it's good then?
so it's in *wco-systems*?
so it's in no way a replacement, not even the same work
so it's in their court
so it's just a body moving bass box eh?
so it's just a coincedence that every time it goes down that serve-event failure appears
so it's just about to gewtfunny again
so it's just more intelligence gathering ebfore the inevitable bombing
so it's just something that will go away when we have a RH pkg
so it's just that cl-sql or some sub-pkg is a possible backend -- cl-sql-postgresql or cl-sql-odbc or whatever
so it's just you two and raul down there?
so it's just, what's the point
so it's kind of like that in my head
so it's legit in 1.7.1 ?
so it's like 2 degrees of separation from celebrity anywho
so it's like a counter of a sort?
so it's like half improvised, half pre-written
so it's like the dates I originally sent in, but pushed back one week
so it's looking for a slot named sql-sys::cache on the EC and binding that to cache var ?
so it's more like I can't concentrate on what I need to, but I am concentrating
so it's network issue, yah?
so it's nice.
so it's not a hash table, it's a policy object?
so it's not a problem
so it's not a server method
so it's not advised to load complete umich data?
so it's not an issue
so it's not as compressed as AC3
so it's not blocking anything
so it's not done
so it's not entirely linear
so it's not impossible we could support it in the future
so it's not in the contract
so it's not just the convenience of oh, do that, it's easy
so it's not my bug, just that he updated SLIB to not contain that, and I had not moved it into guile and changes it's name yet
so it's not really a bug per se
so it's not really delaying anything except maybe having to fix this stuff in place on production instances
so it's not so simple
so it's not too hairy to whip up a serialized Java Object then?
so it's only one field in one table.  The reason the from clause has the other [view-table statements in it is that the :where clause refers to those other tables
so it's possible if they turned it on by themselves
so it's pretty easy to make the split
so it's pretty fresh
so it's pretty useless for looking at saic data bugs?
so it's probably a hardware setup ish
so it's probably about time to start swapping new tapes into the amanda rotation
so it's probably not fixed
so it's probably safe to change it to something more ... abbreviated
so it's really bad?
so it's really the time to pour on testing
so it's safe to go down to slink slib ?
so it's something universal
so it's still semi-hosed
so it's still some kind of order of eval problem
so it's still the old kernel?
so it's stuck in some weird state huh
so it's supposed to work right
so it's tagged and releasable then?
so it's the html-form object
so it's the same one.
so it's up and test worthy
so it's up to them whether they are going to keep doing that, *or*...
so it's valid, just maybe not what you want the data to look like
so it's very uncool to do things like have your lisp hang, which hangs the who9le webserver, etc
so it'sprolly better to get enteract working properly
so italian, french, spanish, portugese and german
so iterating thru a vector like a list is bad mmkay
so its 10 yards to the truck
so its a 'you scared me' suit.
so its a change in the past 6 hours
so its a good time
so its a legit data problem?
so its an ENH
so its an interface bug?
so its being dantensified
so its better to go on fixing piddly little shit?
so its either 7:05 or 9:45
so its gonna die again
so its gonna need to be entered by hand, and it seems like the current resource interface could handle that
so its just { username => 0 } ?
so its like we have one complete system for marc then other for the rest?
so its mearly temporal
so its not a complete waste of time
so its not so much an arguemnt of function as a check to unbridaled change?
so its on onshored.com instead
so its outside our firewall 
so its the app that is confused
so its theoreticaly deplyable to anyone
so its trickling out
so its upstream of gopher
so its worth it

sql
sql databases are so junky
sql dump wackery?
sql is percolating up too far
sql is the query language, that doesn't determine how quick the rdbms is able to scan all the entires in a table
sql kinda sucks that way
sql objects will be exported by pushing all nonvirtual slots into a plist
sql script + restart
sql stuff is in
sql understands both
sql-stmt-open is basically the top-level of a recursive descent parser.
sql-sys::on-txn-abort rock on
sql-sys::sequencep is there as well, putting the rest of it together
sql-sys:ensure-schema needs an :do-whatever-you-have-to-just-make-code-agree-with-db-please
sql-typecast is head only
sql: stores many i of many class, knows what classes it stores .. apparently, from *default-schema*
sql::database ought to inherit from to-store-mixin, right?
sql::disconnect
sql::metadata-entity probably works

that circulate from the same center
that circulation screen delay problem is baaaack hardcore

that command above, does what?
that commercial cracks me up for some reason
that commercial is funny
that compile error is in :circulation 33 regression tet
that compression really fux up the sounds :P
that computer
that concerns me, I was under the impression that he had tested that stuff
that concurs with what I am seeing
that contains scope as well
that coould be bad
that corner... so empty *sob*
that costs money
that could all conceivably fit into the status bar
that could be :)
that could be Find Tickets for sure
that could be a clue eh?
that could be about the coolest thing i ever received in a mass-forwarded office email
that could be better than going to the empty bottle and being trodden upon
that could be changed though...
that could be dangerous
that could be done
that could be done in memory, if all the objects fit in memory.  If they don't then you have to pull page them in and out

that could be it
that could be moved to a more proactive position in the log formatting code
that could be our corpoate logo!
that could be rough...
that could be the name of your liquor store

that data has a shelf life
that data is already used to populate the Year property of holdings
that data is inCVS, what you get on wco-tests::demo
that data needs ot be gzipped before shipping or something
that data was just ignored in 6.lisp
that datacenter was previously known as 'stinky basement rock studio'
that date can't be right
that day is open
that deadly sin, vanity
that defeats the purpose
that definately to me seems specific to them
that define the open-close times for the weekly schedule
that definitely sounds like 'fun'
that definition includes specifying the relationships they have with one another, how intervals can interact or overlap or contain one another
that depends on how much testing you can get in, and when
that depends on if he had emacs compliance support turned on
that depends on sufficient coverage, which is never complete and an ongoing project, and oten at the framework level
that depends on the answer to my question above
that depends on what PIN you are using, what reosurce, what the limit is etc...
that depends on whose grave you are digging feh true
that did it
that did it!
that did it, thanks. the ratio is a little wonky, but I can play with that. If you will update the docs on the support page before training today, Pam and josh can use the illustration while talking about circ policies.
that did the trick
that did ti
that didn
that didn't do anthing for me man
that didn't happen, but the class identification in the table needs to be factored
that didn't work
that didn't work for you?
that didn't work.
that didn't work....um
that didnt' fix it
that dir is for docs, not makefiles
that director has a big thing for anal like orafices
that distinction only exists at the ifconfig interface level
that do'd it, thanks gracchus
that document is older than dirt
that doens't explain Cannot Commit Checkout with Errors.  
that doens't seem right
that doens't tell me anything josh
that does
that does NOT mean that the customizations are loaded
that does clean upgrades
that does indeed suck
that does it for me
that does it i'm moving
that does it i'm rolling everybody back to version 1.7.2
that does it! out you two pixies go, through the door or through the window
that does it, i'm shoving a pipe bomb down that Level3 manhole over by my apartment
that does mean that a crash in the middle of a transaction can result in out of sync indexes
that does not display usage fee
that does not give you money
that does not look like the reservation blue
that does not make for smooth check out action
that does remind me that production of the printed reports should be test suite'ized if not already
that does ring a bell
that does seem like an overreaction
that does seem to imply to me that there is a logci bug there...
that does seem wierd
that does show up sometimes on failed loign
that does suck
that does what I wanted to do?
that doesn't actually disable docs
that doesn't answer my question
that doesn't answer the question
that doesn't answer the question tho
that doesn't change the fact that most bugs are more checklist stuff, edge conditions
that doesn't change, just lists
that doesn't even know about make clean!
that doesn't even make sense
that doesn't ever change
that doesn't happen but in the very height of summer
that doesn't have a 'q' in it
that doesn't help
that doesn't help me either
that doesn't help with the diff problem
that doesn't help, I need more more more 8)
that doesn't help, because im not sure what I'm assuming IS there
that doesn't hurt
that doesn't leave orphaned metadata or nuttin?
that doesn't look right
that doesn't make any sense
that doesn't make much sense at all does it
that doesn't make sense
that doesn't matter, because the real solution to all of this is to include guile-slibconfig in libguile6-slib itself and then it won't matter will it?
that doesn't matter.. its only needed by java at build time, and the deb includes the .jar prebuilt
that doesn't mean run config.status
that doesn't mean that's the rev I was using...
that doesn't mean we can enforce it in the Framework tho
that doesn't mean we have to update all customers
that doesn't mean we should stop working on it
that doesn't mean you can't be my chum
that doesn't mean you're not closing fast enough...
that doesn't neccessarily mean you were into Zep
that doesn't really totally work for me
that doesn't say it won't be available at all..
that doesn't seem correct
that doesn't seem right does it
that doesn't seem to do it either.
that doesn't seem to have anything to do with FTP
that doesn't sound too bad
that doesn't surprise me.
that doesn't tell me anything...
that doesn't work for you?

that estimate is padded for safety btw
that estimated usage fee bug is putting alberto's underpants in a twist
that exec coming forward and saing that some other guys where trying to pin it on Lay, naming Skilling
that explains a lot
that explains a lot josh
that explains it 8-)
that explains my surprise, I figured he was dead
that explains policy
that explains presentation types, which is what the clim subdir in IMHO is all about
that explains some things.
that explains something i saw tho
that explains the epi-cycles!
that explains the undefined subroutine
that explains why cvs is not adding new dirs by default when i up
that exploit has been public for, what, months?
that expresses their requirements
that fact is, errors during macroexpansion, read errors, etc do not emit anything as we have it now
that falls under general integrity problems which I don't think we check for aggressively enough
that feature has been broken for 9 months or something, you'd think they would remember
that feels better on lips than eyes i would say
that feels like admin manual since it requires shell, editing in linux
that feels like the logic of how iris import decides whether to make a new type or use an existing one is fried
that feels like the psoft stuff
that feelsl ike log bloat
that felt good
that figures.  Thats what Josh is struggling with right now
that file defines a version of render-biblio-record which calls publication date
that file has the frozen tag on it
that file is a keyring: pgp -ka file
that file is big.
that file was a head-splitting mind-fuck for me a few weeks ago...
that file was supposed to be removed over a week or two ago
that finds a crash condition but not the cause of the leak, tho
that first dune movie sucked
that first one didn't really hammer me into the groun
that fits his character, this is the chap who was supposed to mvoe to Chicago with me but backed out after I was here
that fits in the chassis?
that fits with what josh said about releasing 3.0.2
that fix
that fixed it then
that fixed it:
that fixed it?
that fn was a serious ass pimple
that forms thing is a netscape bug, unfixable by us or anyone besides netscape.

that function was renamed, or split into make-marc-bibliographic-extractor + make-marc-holding-extractor
that g4 is itchin for it
that game is a touch too realistic...
that genre enjoyed 2 days of worldwide popularity in mid 1990 when linux got sound support
that gets backed up to tape right?
that gets checked on pickup, or scanned, or whatnot
that gets macroexpanded, so that X captures a live variable in my code, that is how you compile SQL queries and have variables in them
that gets rid of all your sticky tags and updates to the head
that gets so ass after a few keywords stack up
that gets somewhat complex when you have to consider indicator character values to determine how date fields are encoded
that gets stomped by that
that girl grew up and now she works at uri
that girl that died in israel was a webcheckout user
that gives it the correct behavior as far as I have seen and tested on the circ form
that gives me an idea
that gives me something to do tommorow, we should have tests for hte filesystem-db and catalog store
that gives us 4 weeks before alpha testing
that gives us more time to switch names
that gives us the power :)
that gives you 8 hours
that gives you admin access at [checkout center]
that goes in site-config yah?
that goes to me
that goes without saying, opus

that happened to me too b4
that happens
that happens alot on fridays for some reason
that happens on the branch sometimes too
that happens to me all the time, the world is just thick with Craig Brozefskys
that happens to more more reliable than an M-16 8)
that happens when i run an applet, everything works, it just pops that up when the appletviewer quits :P
that hard part is not tracking persistent data in Apache, the hard part is robustly encoding the session data in-band or out-of-band
that hardly seems fair
that has all been done in 1.8.1
that has all the gold and jewels in big piles
that has always been more of a hassle than a feature anyways
that has been fixed

that includes onsite training i'm sure
that includes the GUI apps

that indicates a much worse problem somewhere else.
that info is not in installing-webco.txt
that information isn't in contacts
that insert into the event set is the validation phase does not mean we need avl trees tho
that instance is getting so stale
that instance is the result of one select
that instance needs upgrade to latest 2.0.9

that involves a few lines of code
that is

that is a good sign
that is a good thing
that is a good vot
that is a great song
that is a gret line when taken out of context.
that is a gule thing and has nothing to do with my package
that is a hairy spot in which I have made mistakes
that is a hard shot 8)
that is a hit
that is a huge manpower sink
that is a jesseism I think
that is a joke
that is a lame solution I think
that is a legacy rule from when we didn't have set optins or 'strike options'
that is a long fuckin time
that is a long message
that is a lousy description but you get the drift?
that is a luser error
that is a man of exasperation?
that is a matter of trimming
that is a max new number of peeps for chubwekout
that is a mook problem, not webcheckout
that is a network problem then
that is a new schema change yes

that is really uncool
that is referenced from UncommonSQL.system
that is referencing the ENTITY defined in doc-text.ent
that is rich
that is right, it will upgrade the instance to 2.0.x branch latest, no migration

that is the way it should be IMO.
that is the way it should work
that is the webcam proggie
that is the whole design
that is the wurst kind ...
that is to perfect, it's a calling
that is to say the ones in the popup lists are the ones on the desk
that is to say, no
that is to say...
that is to sya, you simply confirmed that a certain reservation didn't expire
that is to what i thought you were referring with the 'karl karl karl'
that is too complicated for me
that is too far
that is too late now, they are production and we can't send them that box
that is too long and has spaces and escaped characters in it

that is waht it looks like exactly
that is webco.artic.edu ?
that is weird
that is weird that those two consutrctors have different effects
that is weird though
that is what I am asking, you need not even see her allocation to determine that
that is what I am doing now :)
that is what I am loading
that is what I am talking about too
that is what I am testing
that is what I am trying to do...log in on www1
that is what I be doing
that is what I called irritating
that is what I eternally ponder
that is what I figured
that is what I get for running the same lisp instance for a week
that is what I had
that is what I just asked you and you said yes 8)
that is what I just figured out
that is what I mean
that is what I mean, not metrics for performance, but how would you like for me to attempt to quanitfy the work that is needed for you
that is what I menat by sueprvise
that is what I needed to know
that is what I said in the email
that is what I said we was doing in projex
that is what I think is happenin atually

that is what I was asking
that is what I was figuring
that is what I was fixing
that is what I was going to say next 8)
that is what I was told.  Ninja's are bad guys
that is what I was wondering.
that is what I would do at least.  Because the request hash was indeed gigantic, and it would seem that that data is being kept around still
that is what I would want to impose
that is what I'm telling you do to, but in a way that is backwards portable
that is what I'm trying to figure out
that is what Mishak calls me, Kleg

that is what me thought
that is what my postfix does

that is wher I am going
that is where i am working
that is where i start to get scared
that is where it gets infected
that is where proposed chagnes to the database are going to accumulate over the course of the request.
that is where you hacked it, wrongly, apparently
that is why I didn't close it
that is why I dig this vaio
that is why I mentioned commit-phase-1 in the EC, that is where the database updates it's records
that is why I said it could be either or
that is why I suggest you just do :distinct t
that is why I think it fits user perspecive better
that is why I told you do not update instances
that is why html-element derived from html-view
that is why i need caffiene
that is why it has a seperate copyright, the LGPL.  I discussed our distribution needs with a few of the developers of mcclim and they are kwl what what I'm doing and in fact welcome the idea of IMHO using clim
that is why it is a two step process to edit Contact Phone
that is why it is assigned to me
that is why it takes so long, it's gotta be iterating over thousands of objects
that is why it will be autogenerated by default
that is why lefty and karl and fitz are no longer here!
that is why lefty shaved his head ya know, cause otherwise it was just a mass o dinglberries from Fitz's evil scataloical games during client meetins
that is why lisp rocks, because you can stop and look around easier
that is why teachers in school make you put your name in upper right 8)

that is wirelass WAN that I need then
that is with the index-clear taken out
that is work still left
that is worrisome   
that is worth you taking a look at

that is your MUA saying that then, ause postfix doesn't care on my box
that is your home dir
that is your spec.
that is!

that is, I forgot to test multiple regimes
that is, Quotes
that is, after you pick it up, look at the two checkouts, and they do indeed have the same checked out reoruce?
that is, allocation state had a table

that is, build all dist stuff, then run sets against different datasets, different module and customization configurations 
that is, can I do wco::start  wco::stop wco::start ?

that is, http and ssh in to any machine
that is, if I am searching for allocations for person with the name foo, I basically find all people with name substring matching foo and then find all allocations with one of those people
that is, if the product has a mechanism at all -- which in July, it won't
that is, if they did not come from psoft or something
that is, if they let me out of the country at all
that is, it is not prefixing the keyword :start with a :, so it's being read in as just a symbol into the currentpackage
that is, it's blank
that is, it's either after 2.2 or with 2.2
that is, just do something like that .. explicitly avoid validation code in order to attain something
that is, let pserver access from outside the firewall
that is, like, like uh totally awsum dewd man
that is, like, true
that is, not load them if they are not needed
that is, preferable to fork'ing
that is, reducing marc strings into an indexable versions
that is, set up some imageservers for users

that is, the length of time it takes a naked mole rat to gallop a furlong.
that is, they both exist
that is, they cannot move back
that is, turning on all storage without installing *any* objects, even the admininstrator and defaults
that is, we can dump mod_webapp and use completely std apache tools
that is, who is working where?
that is, would have done without me having to ride you the whole way to get it done?
that is, you can break it easily on holding record create.
that is, you replace a well-bounded part of the system with something that you can be confident doesn't have negative side-effects
that is.
that is...
that is:
that is: do something .. in webcheckout .. that renders the thing dead
that is: go into testing 25 May 2001, possible release 1 June 2001
that is: not you, karl, i meant opus
that is: stores connected
that isin the eval-when right?
that isn't even true is it?
that isn't going ot help you solve the bug
that isn't hierarchy is it?
that isn't supported anymore
that isnt hard
that issue
that issue is valid -- is it fixable?
that it can
that it did NOT sort
that it doesn't work as well as it could
that it is faster
that it is why it is better to work when you guys are over there
that it looks like they're going to offer him
that it should be disallowed that is
that it was configured not to back up
that it was the truth
that it was too unstable for me to delve into 
that it's HELL!!

that way I authenticate myself with my secret key, but I never hae to type in a password

that way I can get the VM prompts and auto-attendant stuff going
that way I can just stuff it in midnight activity
that way I can see if the packets are getting to the firewalls external itnerface.  I know that they were not getting to it's itnernal interface
that way I could assigna person just a specific capbility
that way I don't gotta bounce off queso to do mmy work

that way it's only one link for both of yah going across the T1
that way lies madness.  need to reproduce it
that way nobody can accuse me of being apathetic

that way only one 32kbps stream going across the lame-ass t1
that way our collated-title index could be used
that way people can get real mappings from you if they really need it

that way they get less exposur to weather shit
that way we an make sure that nil is translated into f and t into t wen saving boolean slots to the DB
that way we are all good.  but we need the ability to write translators and otherwise munge shit on the backend
that way we are coveredf
that way we can change their internal representation and DB representation at will in the future
that way we can cover having Lee or someone do them, plus recoup some analysis costs
that way we can do site-specific configuration of packages we get from other places, not just ones where we add a :finally-do line ourselves
that way we can do this faster
that way we can make the right decision
that way we have feedback from testers, and we know what is being covered

that way you can always map it back to the other system
that way you can ask for a pretty version of the field by a given property name
that way you can switch a resource between serialized and unserialized.  Right now a resource you set to serialized that was previously unserialized would instantly have a bad schedule
that way you can use inline and we move towards debianization
that way you could even apply infinit extens to the timeline 
that way you could have the easiness of defining the test, with the help of fixtures for making them idempotent and insulated from one another
that way you don't get freaky 8)
that way you get the branch, right before his checking
that way you have all your message metadata, and can associate pictures and other things easily into your articles
that way you have an SGML -> FOP engine, then pipe the FOP to your backend processor

that webpage says it attaches as Happy99.exe
that weird mix of enless days and nights...
that went bye bye?

that's almost IPO worthy, in retrospect
that's almost as good as an Carbonic Martini

that's always stel's line -- not mgmt
that's amazing
that's amazing... they have a lisp OCI thingie then -- but don't we need to adapt it to uncommonsql ?
that's an MP thingee
that's an annoying one since it's all thru the app
that's an area wehre more docs would be good
that's an assumption
that's an auld saic feature
that's an enhancement tho
that's an enounter, a coffee encounter
that's an exaggeration
that's an example from my butt, my general argument stands
that's an exponential
that's an horrible idea
that's an hour per image and that's just phase 1
that's an image that's going to linger
that's an intenral lib in gcc
that's an interesting bug, though...
that's an interesting proposition that might warrant a committee
that's an internal Sun memo in case that's not clear
that's an internal thing ... the reason we had to send that list to the hopkins guys is because they are configuring a Redhat server, which is not really supported except in special cases

that's based on the way you exported the data from excel
that's basically metadata as it exists now but mapped intoa  single table
that's basically the #1 priority right now
that's bc you started too early
that's be great
that's beautiful
that's becasue admin is prolly not employed and authorized to log into any centers
that's becaue I don't report bugz, I FIX them.
that's because MIke is a punk rocker!
that's because applications are almost never actually designed for users
that's because he cares, dude
that's because it didn't crash
that's because it's waiting for a lisp
that's because of pam
that's because the modules don't have wco_branch-2_0 on them
that's because they are busy fixing sound cards :)
that's because they bought it and shipped it to us
that's because we have schedule data stored in a way optimized for it's access, as well as metadata and the object table
that's because we're in internal testing only
that's because you are obviously a lowly peon!
that's because you are trying to chck it out int he same 60 second period as you create it
that's because you dismissed X as not being an issue
that's because you don't flash the wad
that's because you have no grasp of the hilarity
that's been a problem a couple times for me ... i thought i fixed that tho
that's been broken since 2.0.0
that's been chewed over, I guess.
that's been hacked to just return the name on SAIC 
that's been happening to me a lot
that's been included in update-dump-from-freeze
that's being fixed for 3.1 fortunately
that's belittling, not berating or chastising!
that's better
that's better anyhow
that's better than all at once because then you might blow it all on hookers and blow
that's better than anal mucous I guess
that's better than logging An allocation for ________ was created.
that's better than most software companies would do
that's better, so are you halfway through that then? I see a lot of keyword terms still getting generated on the search form.
that's better...tho it was annoying when my dog would never stop licking
that's between craig and adam i think
that's bigger than a tent at least...
that's bitch x for you
that's bithcin
that's biting my ass too

that's boss's pin
that's both a 2.0.10 and 2.1 issue then probably
that's buffer local
that's bug 4427
that's bull shit
that's bullshit
that's bush league 
that's busted, I probalby broke that
that's called a Freudian FUCKUP

that's called lazy evaluation
that's called multi-tracking
that's casey's laptop

that's cleaner
that's clearly impossible, so what am i missing?
that's code for some freaky momma 'bout to put it on you
that's code for we're getting so much angry email our tech support people are swamped
that's common for ppl just getting there feet wet and wanting to learn more

that's concouraging
that's cool
that's cool anyway
that's cool that you wrote those 
that's cool then maybe i'll keep this dlink wireless hub
that's cool with me
that's cool with me i'm working on something else, lois bugs that is
that's cool!
that's cool, I think they get it for the most part
that's cool, cdrecord knows what brand of blank media you are using
that's cool, crai
that's cool.
that's cool. I didn't know that grep supported -r
that's cool. what does the dv ship with?
that's cool...
that's cool... so you wanted someone else's input on the recording? could you have done it all yerself?
that's cool... what does dag get out of it?
that's cool.... saw a lot of jesse commits todaytoo
that's cool: homeless resources
that's coolm too

that's cute
that's dan's job
that's debian PPC

that's definitely it
that's definitely something to track down
that's defsystem
that's delicate 
that's demo being out of data 8)
that's different from saying maybe the instances were out of date, see?
that's different from, say, buttery-velvety?
that's different man..
that's dirty
that's dirty imho basement code
that's done by server
that's dope
that's dope ... you're 'witness killer' and lee is 'laser eye'
that's drama queen thank you
that's easier!
that's easy
that's easy as pie
that's easy enough
that's easy enough i guess
that's easy, just visit alphabetically
that's elementary.  So we need a protocol.  E.g. file is created with mode 222 and only made 444 when writing is complete.
that's emacs failing to emuate a vt100
that's emacs syntax .. it's wrong for grep
that's encoded in the pkg itself as the depends
that's enough for me.  I ride the bus!
that's entertainment
that's entirely true
that's enuf
that's envelope from
that's especially geeky
that's etymologically suspect
that's even better

that's even stupider but much easier to fix
that's everything
that's evil
that's exactly how I feel
that's exactly the sort of bug that i'll never be able to fix :P
that's exactly what he's doing
that's exactly what i need!
that's exactly what i should do!
that's excellent.
that's exciting
that's fabulous
that's far more important than the fact that we saw homer simpson last night
that's far, far closer to the spirit
that's filed
that's fine
that's fine ... if they whine about the cost then we could think about dropping it
that's fine as long as we keep bugging them
that's fine by me
that's fine craig, no need to add in something that is not being demanded
that's fine enough....
that's fine i am just popping around to log bugs correctly
that's fine i think
that's fine with me
that's fine, but i dont feel i should have to tell you every yime i do a demo on the demo instance either
that's fine, i don't mind running it like that
that's fine, i'll check them in again soon
that's fine, it will probably take a while for me to get 4501
that's fine, it works on prep
that's fine, it's not my place to engineer
that's fine.
that's fine. I was just giving you a heads up.
that's fine...
that's fine.... yes, it's slow...
that's first para second section

that's funny cause that's a legitimate rumor floating around
that's funny man
that's funny of craig turning around and giggling
that's funny oh shit
that's funny was doing that last week
that's funny, I didn't see your reply to emmy and sent the exact same reply...
that's funny, I remember testing that personally earlier in the week
that's funny, cos when you did that, some of my tcp connections to prep got scrambled.
that's funny, it didn't work
that's funny, it reminding me of this wierd street I lived on growing up in Ann Arbor
that's funny, it works for me...
that's funny, people always quote me saying things i have no recollection of saying
that's funny, the gordon issue had 2 sales people sending it twice to emergancy list, that is, 5 copies of it
that's genuinely funny
that's getting v. little testing
that's gnus going way over my head
that's god
that's going to be kinda annoying to do... hmm
that's going to be my new answer for everything
that's going to be something that each school will have a different answer for
that's going to break every time we have to reload their stinking app
that's going to cause headaches a plenty though
that's going to hit us on every school
that's going to make it harder to roll up the branch into the head... oh well
that's going to make my work hard
that's gonna be a hit
that's gonna be a trip

that's good to know
that's good to know the standards are still high...
that's good!
that's good, yah, I've noticed more tests
that's good.
that's good. keep up the stretching and the ice

that's good... local-time to wall-time kept hitting me
that's got mixers, effects and hard drive built in
that's got tests for the rtypes working now
that's got the blue cheese, canadian bacon upon a grilled chicken patty
that's got to be as hard as licking your elbow
that's got to be far more rewarding
that's gotta be a change to resource import
that's gotta be a riot
that's gotta be hectic
that's gotta be near the top, dude, 21 out of, what, 500000 ?
that's gotta be screwy data?

the  Defined on patron class Nil thing is mst fixered
the  hell you say? let me check
the # is shorthand for symbol-function
the #1 google result for pet cow is a picture of my friends pet cow
the $ means subfield, the 'a' designates the interpretation
the $$ showing up at inappropriate times :)
the $300 thing--you talking about microcenter?
the $INSTANCE variable from the script must not be set
the &aux thingy
the '-a' asks for the whole list, and I think there are generally >100 on relleno at any given time.
the 'Advanced' tab
the 'Edit...' in the top right corner
the 'Ghost stories of an Antiquary'
the 'Location Search' page?
the 'Sea of Happiness'?
the 'data' keywork in the line above should be a list of instances.
the 'deep' stuff all works
the 'drexciya story' is soo much better
the 'format constraint' is just the beginning of the difference.
the 'ga' version ... it's whomping
the 'inline' was a good clue
the 'leet dudes still trying to get in?
the 'list types' effect employment records and some things on groups
the 'more flying chrome! more flying chrome!' one?

the 'storm' last night was rather an anti-climax
the 'wires .. wires ..' helicopter ...
the *flag* -P means to prune empty dirs
the *right* template1 has that table
the *templates* which appear on those pages are only the side bar and the top banner stuff
the *wco-modules-list* is the new way to do it.  No more compile-time configuration in 1.8.1 and forward
the + in front of physical location is for?
the +1 hour thing?
the +o
the - means stdout
the --- target means that the bug is unmilestoned
the -1's are what do it i think
the -B argument I think is number of shared mem 8k buffers to alloc I think
the -dP means add new dirs and Prune old dirs
the -kk inhibits the $Id$ stuff from conflicting
the -p# argument bugs me... it should figure it out...

the DSL is distinct from any phone lines
the DSL is nice and cheap, and we can connect to respectable backbones with it

the UI = 5
the UI apparatus for editing gorups of reservations wouldn't be trivial
the UI code has gotten more obtuse since the last time I was working in it
the UI codeing is much easier in 2.1
the UI could be better, esp the stuff up by the topic
the UI has to use this stuff
the UI is a whole nother pickle-jar
the UI is totaly scragged
the UN has no constituency and it's paymasters are the nation states

the URL
the URL encoding scheme is just a bait and sitch and 3 months down the line they will have more complaints
the URL encoding system has serious flaws tho, as I discussed already
the URL is out of date until I fucking commit my local copy... what do you think?
the URL is probably where you get the file to import
the URL is where you get the file to import
the URL sholud also be in the header fields.

the abort happened AFTER store-modified-schedules was succesfully run, but BEFORE the allocation-state was set to :cancelled-reservation.
the abort is not happening at the DB level dutr!
the abort thingee?
the abort without transaction in context
the above action is two things: ensuring login is secure, and then making page insecure

the account code automaticaly pays the invoice, not a line item on it.
the account code entry
the account code is on the agreement form already
the account codes and department codes are exactly what appear in the UCB production DB
the account gets billed for that reservation even though went thru the system a day early
the act of viewing an allocation is rather weird
the active subsection image is not a link tho
the actual error is duplcated key db error for a metadata slot.  may not be reproducible, had to kill netscape

the alloc is not there
the alloc-rule for checking avialablilty appears busted, so just focus on that.
the allocate temporals are being modified across transaction boundaries, so we can't roll back when the renewal fails later
the allocation does not exist
the allocation has no pointers to ANY of this
the allocation is created in the ec, we need to remove it from the ec
the allocation is in a semi-returned state
the allocation is stil there, what's the deal, is it still triggering the err?
the allocation logs are there to reflect ... what was used
the allocation really has nothing to do with the act of taking the resource offline
the allocation temporal objects are wcof-entities now.  If yoiu ahev the data I would recomend test migrating syracuse again and seeing if bug 4811 has been resolved
the allocation to resource label index is an example of one we need to solve in 3.1
the allocation values are used to fill in the initial invoice
the allocation was aborted

the alpha accounts are because that is what alpha is for, giving accounts to people

the apartment?
the apes and gorillas always look pretty happy there, they definitely have the best digs.
the app I'm working on is pretty simple, next to LOIS.
the app is 'interesting' .. I'm not sure that it exhibits any really good practices though
the app is erroring out really strangely when the session times out
the app is going way fast dutrs
the app is not a simpel TODO list
the app is pretty solid
the app is the spec :)
the app is too broken for me to test any more
the app not the sex party
the app notifies as soon as the resource itself is selected
the app still doesnt show them to me

the apple LCDs tend to abe a bit jittery, the desktop onesthat is
the apple guys razz me hard for being so addicted to emacs.
the apple is different colors on the card every 5th card.
the applet
the applet checks to see if the patron has changed since the last resource was added to checkout
the applet display turned out to be pretty simple
the applet is kinda crapped out but that's probably just cut-up madness
the applet is not workign on my branch instance.  Is that a probelm?
the applet is oversized vertically tho
the applet is poo
the applet needs some work
the applet problems I reported seem to be gone, aside from one: schedulator doesn't show RRTs
the applet resource selection is mostly nailed .. where it used to look like it was picking out a checked out resource, for example
the applet should track all time in universal
the applet was loaded yesterday afternoon, and the rtype-subtypes request came at 11:30 AM today
the application always emits that warning

the article does not support your statement cars kill as many people from pollution as they do from accidents
the articles inclusion of that point is to shift the blame for those arrests and attacks on their community resources to the charities themselves

the beta capsule?
the beta date I mean, the 16th is stuck in my head
the beta doesn't seem to actually manage to create locaton schedules
the beta instance is up but I get:
the beta is a *bit* stale
the beta is actually fine
the beta is another story
the beta is on prep too
the beta is probably 48 hours stale from the head

the big one?
the big payoff!
the big thing would be to take the code less personally
the bigger problems are that the billing bugs were closed without any testing, without any UI existing
the biggest 1.8 problems wer ethe stuck allocs
the biggest being that types are the most numerous, so reducing the rtype owners ability to set policy on a mass level is a bit of a pain
the biggest ones are the pricing link being absent on the portfolio page
the biggest problems they have in the present have to do with larger scale changes to type defeinitons.
the biggest thing I noticed is that the code I normally would write to test thins out in an ad-hoc manner, little snippets here and there, typing stuff diretly intot he listener, ends up in the test suite
the bike accident was less tahn 3 yrs ago
the bike lane on elston is three feet wide, where it exists, the rest of it is parking

the brozevsky factor ?
the bucolic village of grand avenue
the buffer sizes are hard to figure out
the bug
the bug I was whining about?
the bug craig was talking about kinda distrubs me a bit...
the bug deficit was closed up so there's plenty of activity finding bugs
the bug doesn't really tell me much at all
the bug for return time is not in because they haven't signed the contract yet
the bug has been there for a while, really
the bug has pretty detail info
the bug in resource-summary?
the bug is #3308
the bug is 486 -- limits on schedulator! woo!
the bug is actually in sql:connect
the bug is assigned to you...
the bug is because of a missing transition from rsvp-cancelled to, um, something
the bug is closed
the bug is deep imho voodoo
the bug is hard to test though
the bug is in flatten-policy i believe
the bug is now a blocker on support action
the bug is on the support action milestone
the bug is phenomenal parafeature
the bug is semi-unclear on that point...
the bug is that it operates on any already confirmed checkokuts
the bug is that it's bigass, and should be smallass
the bug is that the contents-label says 167 records found
the bug is that there is no reference to it in utexas 8)
the bug is that there is no way to change its status after it's been marked as auto-paid
the bug is that you can commit with an error
the bug is this:
the bug is transient, both checkouts are now returned
the bug jesse came across was an example, I had removed those clauses
the bug king has arrived
the bug on cmucl
the bug only hits the heavily used instances
the bug report is quite usable, sir
the bug says the problem is that the condition note is set to that... how is that a bug?
the bug seems to be there in 2.0.3 as well
the bug should say so
the bug that cannot  die!
the bug that has not been filed
the bug that is 8)
the bug they're seeing is due to usql
the bug was assigned to adam, not cbls fault
the bug was on 2.0.10 right?
the bug where it can gett added to the applet is not
the bug you filed is still open
the bugfixes are not done yet
the bugs are assigned to him I believe
the bugs are getting progrssively nit-pickey
the bugs are kina annoying though
the bugs i found earlier seem fixed
the bugs that pop up are pretty easy to fix
the bugs they are related!
the bugs we're seeing are getting harder and harder to diagnose
the bugs were fixed.  it's just operating in that beaurocracy is sucha  bitch
the bugs were spec'd
the bugs where they behave differently when being debugged are strictly heisenbugs
the bugs, they elude!
the bugstone is a classic one jesse
the bugzilla bot crap blows

the build
the build is so spammy
the build on clotho is threaded
the build problems are all fixed already
the build thingy?

the cache mgmt is different, and has no been a problem since I fixed the auth thingee
the cached data is particular to the individual session
the cacheing has to be turned off to get consistent results
the caching and editingcontext system is simpler and safer than it ever has been
the caching mechanism for RRT schedules is somewhat complex, wanna make sure I get it right
the caddar cdar cddr stuff for indexing into schedule changed

the catalogs tests do
the catch may be that I need network to install stuff soI can get on the network

the cause being what now?
the cause?
the cd doesn't hurt though... paranoically:
the cd is just sneakernet to get it to bankone
the cd is titled The Best of Giorgio Moroder but i think it should really be titled The Heart-Wrenching Decline of Giorgio Moroder
the cd skips

the celery?
the cgi?
the chain needs replacing tho
the chang ein question was in odcl;objects.lisp I beleive
the change I'm contemplating is require 1 developer review on any redesign 
the change propogation and validation protocols are easier to define, and easier to control that way
the change was in there before. cbl migrated them once
the change will make it a 4 digit string
the change-class stuff confuses the EC
the changelog that is
the changelog works ok for that but it's pretty technical and obscure
the changes Im talking about would be in allocation-core
the changes that were made to their 2.0.11.1 instance were deployed on thursday
the changes to local-time.lisp and local-time-funcs.lisp need to be rolled into the frozen version
the changes were done with a script which bumps them, let me run it again to make sure it bumped
the changes will be minor, just going to require a few hours of testing and shit

the checking, the data validation has certainly be very ad hoc up to this point
the checklist has been liberated from the evil adam-iban and is now in the hands of dag-i-stan
the checklist is like - not even close to being done dood 1
the checklist keeps me occupied for now
the checklist?
the checkout center and resource schedule bugs are a mystery to me
the checkout confirmation screen misrepresents the checkout
the checkout confirmed page is also only one page, isn't it?
the checkout intervals on the timeline are yellow
the checkout reserve period thing has changed three times at his request already
the checkout verb is soemthign the operator does

the class is all G's
the class is, but it's not used right now
the class object has to know that mapping of names inthe template to class objects, then.

the code doesn't look like what we discussed ... odd
the code for taking resources off line
the code is a bit 'distributed'
the code is a mess in most places
the code is forced, the comments are few
the code is in 1.lisp to migrate them, and the resource still exists
the code is messy
the code is modular
the code is not there now doesn't make any sense to me
the code is not there now, and yes it does
the code is obtuse
the code is rather complex and I'm not totally sure I get it
the code is sloppy
the code is wicked though
the code looks suspicious
the code poop language.
the code runs fine
the code was there, it just wasnt being loaded
the code word is morecats
the code would say other than :unknown
the code's trivial
the codes are dumped via a falsh pattern

the compile succeeded
the compiler deletes it cause it was in the wrongplace.
the compiler generates C code from the lisp source
the compiler is free to ignore, too. 
the complaint is from the wco-restore in 2.1, which doesn't like the keyword
the complexity here is that every customer pretty much has a custom set of data for holdings, biblios, and how they display is custom for various contexts

the concordia blocker is not a blocker, but it is pointing to a possible migration issue
the cond form looks for a method or a reference, but either way
the condition note in the applet thing was a bug he filed
the condition note is the same for all of the isntances of unserialized resources
the condition note problem is worse than i thought
the config file i mean
the configure script looks good
the configure, that's it as far as I know
the configured parameter for the wco dbpasswd seems to be ignored

the cops of course didn't notice, so the Palestinian's had to help protect the old hassidic men

the cost for 3.1 testing instances is about to fall to zero
the cost is trivial and IMO way lower than what most users have to do to get support.  besides I already LOOKED AT THE LOGS, you know facts and stuff, and there is hardly any traffic save bots

the current anti-war movement?
the current availability checking is part sucks right now anyways
the current batch of incoming bugs are closing rather easily
the current game si on its 270th move
the current maint branch version
the current mechanism being this specific multi-phase behavior, not the EC stuff as a whole
the current plan for 2.0.11 are thus:

the damn thing is in the middle of a rack in the garage and will have to be powered off to inspect
the damn things looked better on fire then they ever did before
the danger is that it might have other problems trigged by various stuff in wco that we would have to shake out
the danger of lisp programming, perpetual refinement
the danger they think they are being protected from is completely exaggerated by the gov't 
the dark half
the dark side
the dat tapes are a little smaller than regular casettes
the data
the data WAS propogated
the data coming from the framework has to be displayed in a few different ways, yes, both generally, and depending on configuration
the data coming thru WARp and then out apache is good.  if I save a transponder request that makes the applet die, I can then load that same request into a little tester program that reads it from stdin
the data dictionary exists now and is in use and this way of specifying the format of the dump is in use already.
the data dictionary is absolutely fine, I have no truck with that
the data dictionary shall be mighty!
the data dump is a pure pg thingie
the data entry I mean
the data file it looks for in dupes are not being generated
the data formatter could conmtain a recipe for calling 'cell editors'
the data i mean
the data integrity is fine 
the data is already stored in that format though
the data is borked still
the data is completely untouched now, in the psoft integration, it went away
the data is still there?
the data is the data
the data remains in the database though
the data seems to be properly formatted now, so they just need to understand the proper top-level classifications
the data source
the data type for the times in their database are all set to timestamp without time zone
the database backend is not cleaned
the database interaction library
the database stores everything as temporals.  see temporal.lisp
the datacenter is in the basement?
the datamigration task for them is finsihed though
the datasets
the date
the date field was not quoted
the date format is set wrong on SFSU
the date is passed to resource-take-offline
the date is set
the date jogged my mammeries
the date parsing for the UI is a little different ain't it?
the date parsing i mean
the date should be identifiable webcheckout.xml cvs logs and diffs
the date stylings are handled by the date presenters already
the date thing on the timeline
the dates are all different!!!
the dates are returning correctly from db-timestring
the dates would still be assumed to be gmt
the dates, the hours
the dauphin
the dauphin :)
the day I drive out, I am gonna leave the gas on in my apartment, with a small, timed incendiary device
the day he says hozer I expect I will pee
the day i have to make all kinds of calls is the day that the battery says i am 3 quarters full in the morning and then decides to run out by noon
the day it released I think
the day might come when we cant rely on all participants to be in the same time zone
the day-schedule supports one or the other now, no longer both at the same time
the day?
the days on the schedulator were 48 hours long
the db
the db is probably more reliable
the db returns them in alpha order
the db sho'nuff is there
the db state is currently 2.0.3
the db tuning stuff is done, point of diminishing returns on other avenues of investigation
the db you have to do another step  -- still looking

the death of prep fed itno it
the deb can be clever enough to refuse to upgrade from anything but 3.0
the deb has nothing to do with CVS tags
the deb should handle that, right adam?
the deb'd gnumeric is 21 revs out of date
the debauchery
the debian change is to depend on wget
the debian character!
the debian package descriptions are pretty contrary as well
the debian pkg already depends on either postgres-plsql pkg, or the new postgres, which already included plpgsql
the debian pkg seems to be missing pieces
the debugger can't differentiate between the 'page' arg and the 'page' let-binding
the debugger docs.

the decision points anyhow... are you asking me about engineering?
the decision to use .deb was at a time when we thought we would have greater control over the environments webco was deployed in
the declaim bcomes global, that's not good
the declining temperature is great .. people do drugs and beat eachother up indoors now, rather than in front of my house
the decontamination gel rubdown scene was like the most awful indication of self-aware pathetic geek television i've ever seen
the decree is in, time for soup
the dedicated circuits also are very expensive
the deer one
the def types .. the functions that scan the list structure to determine type membership
the default bg image is rauls debian logo
the default debian page does not say worlds greatest index page
the default gateway solution I gave should work now
the default in older debian was not
the default invoice for the allocation would recieve fees and a new invoice would be created for fines
the default is 3
the default is 64
the default render-html method for html-elements isn't getting called on my table browser when the browser's render method calls call-next-method
the default server code requires it
the define-presentation-type 'person bit should say person-userid-link instead of wcof-entity-link
the definitiions i gave are SAIC specific
the definition of parataxis is not expecially helpful either
the definition that i had heard was that gen x is kids of baby boomers
the definitions of the properties themselves, and the data dictionary
the defualt route oslution won't work
the defualt shoudl be set up by the configuration script
the defualt should be Media:or something -- not the default type
the delayed selection with format preferences is a recipe for disappointment IMO
the delete issue
the delete person command on person-detail checks for allocs, etc
the deleted patron i mean
the deleteding line only shows up if you run it with :exec t
the deliver to locations did not migrate I guess
the deliver-to thing has nothing to do with this bug
the deliver-to-oid thing I just handled
the delivery location being the theater itself
the delivery report shows reservations that are deliverable or settable or stikeable
the delivery thing is annoying but i don't think it's worth 1.8.8 by itself...
the dell is still in the office
the demo
the demo 
the demo data set stuff i am working on ...
the demo dataset has been violated and mishandled :)
the demo didn't go down
the demo error is just a problem committing allocations
the demo instance thingee?
the demo is always up
the demo is back
the demo is demo.webcheckout.net
the demo is down!!!
the demo is going to be running with the media feature on

the demographic information for wicker park residents reads like surrealist comedy
the dental mook bug?

the deploy
the descirption field was virtual, which works long enought o generate the allocs
the description of how it works is off
the description of the phase 2 isn't right I don't think... doesn't have the field guide or match the stuff above
the descriptor table is part of the ext2 file syste,
the design decision I just described is quite low level and an implementation issue.  We perhaps could have avoided a waste of a day ro so if we had approached the design of the migration ina  more formal and communicative manner, but as of now, we're all pretty much on the same page with it
the design is BAD
the designer the promoter hired didn't have flyers done before the rephlex show
the designer was totally unaware of the similarity to the 101 Strings logo
the desired behavior for sections is what exactly?  The section title ?  The section number and title ?
the desserts are nonfunctional
the detail argument.  I want the wm to simply stuff a burp-bug-detail
the detail screen should be quite differnt for them.  For one, there is no home location
the details as in, letting the clietns giving us money know the delivery date
the determinate factor is underwear. the frequency of laundry day is determined by how much underwear you own.
the detractors can suck my oil

the diff command shows you what has changed on the branch since last merge
the diff?
the difference being one checks for ec, the other doesn't?
the difference between cell phones in the US and EU 
the difference ebtween the name slot and the evetns slot is obvious
the difference is that UMich wants us to consider those different holdings
the difference is that acceleration requires another input element
the difference is, like, that UMich wants us to consider those different holdings
the different datasets and module configs is critical
the different locations shouldnt effect each other
the different versions of wco have similar states but the function keep changing
the diffing capabilities of cvsweb aren't as good

the dill is coming up nicely out of the 'dillhole'

the director of human resources is a busy person
the directory and the html file don't require the same name but if it will make u happy i'll be glad to change it

the dump
the dump failure was at the ODCL layer, the mapping of OIDs in a filesystem DB failed.  Even a 3.0 wco-framework would have that problem if the ODCL was out of date

the first is adding to the relation on a surrogate object, and then there is adding a surrogate to a relation

the fixtures in my basement are fully enclosed though, which i think causes heat to build up 
the flag I added is not part of that logic, it's just used to track what the person intended to do with the new alloc they are creating.  It doesn't effect logic in the circulation form, just tells the session-allocation webmethod what mode to seed it in.

the group by clause modifies the agregate function, right?
the group detail thing?
the group is created by explicitly grabbing person-with-userid 1000020 but the auths are created by grabbing the first four people returned by find-people
the group is transient, the resauth-rule stays
the group members are the productino itself and the crew members

the guy thought it said jos
the guy was trying to send me to CDW because microcenter doesn't carry diskwarrior
the guy we are buying it from was bummed, has to move saturday and get couch outta there
the guy who got second, Bad Rep, was way tight too.  Very smooth, and very creative.  He broke down some complex beats and was reversing them and shit
the guy who is recording our record was telling me about some doctored ron&nancy reagan tape that stel showed him once

the hard part is xbuild ..
the hard part will be fixing it...
the hard thing is resolving conflicts
the hard thing to esimate is just the logistics of the integration

the hard work is finally starting to pay off for us
the hard works it merely the breadth of it
the hardest part is figuring out how we wanna handle porting issues
the hardest part of filing bugs for me is trying to second-guess what component to use... argh!
the hardest part of installing that was when I dropped the screw into the case and lacerated my knuckle trying to retrieve it

the head is definately looking a lot better...
the head is pretty rough

the head is running on my machine again
the head just feels like its tightening up faster than expected

the horizon was riddled with funnel clouds, including this one that was composed of at least 6 funnels revolving around each other.  It tore thru the trailer parks. and was heading toward us.  I was running around the trailer looking for him, so he could tell me where to go for safety, but couldn't find him.  He had already ditched me and was out back near the hog house sitting in a truck ready t
the horrible memeories of it....
the horror
the horror..... the horror
the host 
the host I'm using to relay into onshore is getting rebooted I think
the host alpha btw
the host just turned the whole shebang over to us
the host key on gohper did change, weeks ago, when gopher was upgraded
the host name or ip of the database server
the host on the onshore lan that you connect to is queso, right?
the host program seems to have no problems reaching dns servers outside the firewall
the host you're getting denied from is explicitly alloed
the hot dogs are evil
the hot dogs down here come wrapped in bacon
the hot ham and cheese that is, not the prototype mismatch
the hothouse owner claims the licenses are all in order.  There was no code violations cited.  Were their code violatiosn for crobar and elsewhere?
the hothouse owners think it was politically motivated, I would like to hear their reasoning
the hounds of war are barking in the hizzouse

the hours tab is bonked
the house you refer to is a 'groovy pad'
the html is fine
the html kid
the html stuff
the html tests weren't testing anything
the html that refers to it
the html-element for rolloverd submit buttons does all the JS shite
the html-elementbased widgets?
the http session timeout issue is not really a big deal
the httpd error log shows evidence that it was RAM starvation...

the hugely cool thing is
the human aspect is the hard part -- UI, sending the email at the right time

the hyperspec?
the i + 3 bit i mean
the i am an irc bot or my friend or kind of like a dumb dog or your buddy
the i and o sets are the register window doodads
the iP phone is working nicely today
the icons at the top?
the icons go away for me too
the idea .. dump .. blow up the computer, get new one, restore == same
the idea basically works, but the object oriented design of it sucks ass
the idea is that any server, network, or other infrastruture owrk that could impede access to client websites or onShore services takes place then.
the idea is that they work both in memeory and in the DB
the idea is to have a way to test theimpact of changes before they are made mainline
the idea is to simulate an actual instance as much as possible
the idea is, generally, Generally people prefer DVDs but fallback, in order, to VHS, etc.....
the idea of a branch merge scares the hell out of me.
the idea that people should be given sets of permissions will be common
the ideal case is that there is an affected reservations step justlike you get whne you take a reserved resource offline
the idealism of our youth
the ideas I have are:
the identity between two actions whose object is clearly different seems rather semantic to me
the ideological concepts being like christian or modern or fundamentalist or western.
the ideology angle is one working premise, the third-worldization of first world workers is another, the proletarianization of the third world in the coastal cities too
the if stmt there is definately wrong
the ignore errors is rather evil since it doesn't stop execution in case db cannot be dropped, e.g. someone is using it
the ilamp
the image expiration stuff is pretty easy actually, I was confusing it with another informal change request
the image is showinf moire artifacts. There is a simple Photoshop technique to get rid of 'em
the image link on the comments thing is broke too
the image of that, AB in general, is just horrid.
the images on the login box were not loadeing either
the images should always be under the directory or in the directory ontaining the docs, makes mirroring and moving it around easier for one
the imho package doesn't exist at all at that time
the imho update kinda scares me
the immediate problem is that we can't get to SAIC
the immediate problem is to be able to load a dump into a blank system
the imo job#
the imp installation on gopher is not setting the from address correctly
the implementation may use unique numbers to identify entities, but they are never touched by me
the implementation was done due to the counterexample
the implication of your suggestion is a chain of cascading dependancies
the implied deliver problem is only a problem because we have a new constraint on sets we didn't have before
the import and contention mechanism
the import bit that is, and then assigning teachers and role players and editing reservations can take place thru the UI?
the import creates rtypes as needed
the import dies?
the import doesnt save any of that
the import is
the import is leaky I think
the import is?
the import itself doesn't have to be > 5000 for the cache to fill up and hang the import
the import should deal with any line ending.... 
the import stuff etc is fully up-to-date
the import thing is to sap the political will to resist the movement
the import-args to filedrop are arguments to the function wcof:import-people,
the import?
the importance of bfast is not to be underestimated
the important bit was that it was not MINE.
the important questions is, what is a ternero, and does it taste good?
the important thing is now you could use emacs for it too
the important thing is that hte new 008 data comes in and is composed right
the important thing is that problems fixed on the branch do propogate up
the important thing is to get the data into their hands
the important thing with reporting the bug is to describe the situation in enough detail that it is reproducible
the improvement is incredible
the impudence branch
the inception of itnernalization?
the includes are just top nav shit so we thought it would be ok if they just didnt see that
the includes in the template...are we waiting on JK and his magic perl script?
the includes pictures
the includes template could create any sort of combo of top and sides
the incomplete invoice search seems to have dropped off the head
the incredible vilently expanding blue van
the indecent proposal
the index can decide: look at the handle-nil keyword argument
the index data collectors
the index design and in core query processing are going to be critical for performance
the index hierarchy tree!
the index is almost 200 hundred entries
the index page is a all communist looking
the index to access the manual
the index-by-name is like biblio_title_index
the index-insert call in wcof-create passes nil for what's supposed to be the parent arg
the index-set is correct
the index.html which is downloaded compared to the online version
the index?  or the manual in general?
the indexed-store just forwards its transaction thingies down the pipe to the fsdb
the indexer-args fix?
the indexes are detachable
the indexes are not picking up any values tho
the indexes are unwieldy, and the table needs to be factored
the indexes are what we do our queries on
the indexes exist for finding those entities, but they are only associated in the sense that they can provide a termlist given an entity class
the indexes need to be updated immediately when the values are changed
the indexes were not getting rebuilt.  Its an old bug
the indians mated with the mogols - thus were created the Thais

the info box!
the info is already stored.
the information is drawn from the resources of that resource type
the infuriating thing about debian upgrade is being asked the same questions over and over
the ingredients on my Ginseng gum are in every language but english
the init problem was a legit debian install problemo
the init scirpt *has* the overcommit stuff in there
the init script doesn't use 'oos', it uses 'mk:oos'
the init script is a RH init kill change
the init script problem was the error trapper was too general
the init script should not conflict if the instances were configured right before make install was done...
the init script should work ok
the init script was not properly updated when they were upgraded ...
the init.d script?
the init.d thing will ignore fialure
the insert of not inserting it??
the inspectors are CIA agents
the install is messed?
the install job# -- I shoudl close them -- is just for initial install
the install mod_webapp, restart apache, restart webco
the install-defsystem thing
the install? doubt it
the installation instructions are pretty good
the installation is pretty cool, but it doesn't take an hour to appreciate ;)
the installation will trigger a simple debconf configuration script which is actually pretty good
the installer doesn't have a system folder?
the installer don't need to care
the installer has all the pretty time wasting features like trancluscent fading dialog boxes and what not
the instance i mean
the instance is alrready up, so no install needed
the instance is pretty much ready to rock as it is
the instance is stale
the instance is the actually scheduled entity
the instance is up
the instance isn't running, right?
the instance was updated early this week
the instances are out of date
the instances are pristine, so no worries
the instant overdue thing
the instert thing?
the instructions could be for anything
the instructions for the pre-amp say to ground it to the reciever
the instructions should be type make
the instructions you have work?
the insurance pays for it though
the int script is huge because the app wrapper is so thin
the int8 thing?
the integer code for ^M is 13
the integration is non trivial if they have a significant data set
the integration systems, psoft, banner etc... change the status to :deleted when they want someone to be marked as deleted in the upstream DB
the intent with wrapping it like that was to indicate that the error occured in the abort hooks, so a more complete recovery mechanism would be invoked.
the intention is that most 'setters' are used by non-wcof packages via 'store-property'
the intention was always to relocate the box to a more optimal location  or send it to them
the interesting part :: the interesting part
the interesting part?
the interface can make or break you
the interface is unclear on the disposition of the allocation
the interface rox out
the interface to he hyperspec that is
the interfaces have to be on two seperate class Cs
the intermediary class that is flattened out shouldnot exist unless there is an object on either side of it.
the intermediary table does not exist as a class

the irish national airline
the irony is buried so far you can't find it!
the is being tunneled thru ssh I wager
the isntance is up.
the issue
the issue don mentioned had to do with authorization being required when it didn't need to be
the issue is building up the list of meta_oids to delete
the issue is specificaly that there is no way to tie location_temporal entries to the regimes that made them
the issue is that I return an alloc and it's state tag is kept as :checkout
the issue is that this third party deb has a wierd kernel package dependency that ayres is trying to get around
the issue is which ressie to display
the issue is, will hehave a way of restarting them?
the issue of marking as modified when ec-propagate is called would indeed account for that
the issue prolly has more to do with the network televisions ability to route signals
the issues have been addressed and I believe josh is going to take care of it tomorrow
the issues with the group detail screen speed are linked pretty closely to the probelms with embeddable result sets, which have been remilestoned.

the jacko tragedy
the java
the java class should not care about person objects as defined by lisp
the java class should not care about the application's data model, it just wants to know what type of java object to cast the return values as
the java community is on the ropes I think
the java doesn't think about such things
the java is horked!
the java is worrying ... I mean,  it might be quite easy but maybe not...
the java is, like, horked
the java might help him get a job
the java one, certainly
the java scroller was getting a little jittery
the java stuff is for webco, which is indeed paying
the java stuff?
the java way says there is a bug
the java will be the roughest bit

the javascript sorta breaks on MSIE v3
the javascript will probably have to be moved around but chances are it won't mess anything up

the kernel?
the kewl thing is that swe're also finding people for non-lisp positions
the key is that apache won't flush output until the warp packet is done
the key is that the return-from is to short circuit that dolist

the latter I think
the latter I think is being targetted now
the latter I will fix post haste
the latter also being the only reason defvar-function was invented
the latter being pretty unlikely
the latter from emacs 'calendar' mode, which prints French revolutionary dates.
the latter in that case
the latter is in one alloc
the latter is like autopay
the latter returns a list of properties and their values for that instance
the latter sounds more correct
the latter taking many many forms
the latter?

the light marked 'front door' on my phone has been blinking for the last hour
the lighting in here sucks, but we're having all new track lighting put in this Saturday
the like one day that FCNBD had their ass over the fire with an end of day deadline
the limit on checkout center is 50 hours for all others
the limit you are talking about applies to checkouts only
the limit?
the limited 7 one?
the limnk is fixed, but yoiu will need to relogin to see it 
the line 53 stuff is not needed, that is onyl for developers, and they will have their own .cmucl-init.lisp anyways
the line I changed, you had also changed
the line is back in effect 
the line item waver was there to allof for the correction of mistakes
the line just looks truncated for some reason
the line realizes he can form all sorts of complicated mathmatical shapes and wins her back
the line to the pole looks questionable
the line was supposed to be moved to my mom's shop, but I guess they only partially moved it
the line we have been using was an onshore line.  Make sure to check with eric about contacting them about it
the lines at wicker park jewelosco are sucks
the lines of code aren't the thing... its the identification of what stats are meaningful to show which is the thing
the lines that is
the link
the link colors are currently the default for browser.
the link to The Annals of Improbable Research is pretty cool
the links are absolute
the linooks box doesn't have the problem
the linux P90 box only does routing duty now.
the linux counter-revolution is seems to be
the linux had no trouble
the linux release notes generally have step-by-step install instrux
the linuxppc 2000 one... it's a shitty dupe job i think
the liquado cam
the liquor selection at uruapense
the lisp and postgres are both still running, but i can't interrupt the lisp process
the lisp asks questions if it finds new source code
the lisp cabal!  i forget to put the Lisp Cabal into that ordering
the lisp code is intolerant and error-prone
the lisp community in general is lame about licenses.
the lisp community in general is very old-fashioned when it comes to IP.  This is a community that spawned Free Software with it's hording and let some of the most beautiful software in the world die behind copyright as companies went bankrupt
the lisp compilers are very very aggresive optimizers
the lisp console you loser
the lisp core has been hovering around 120 Megs
the lisp died with lots of nonsense errors, and with a memory exhausted finally
the lisp has to treat all java times as center wall clock times and not make corrections
the lisp heap stays around 40MB tho
the lisp is 385M
the lisp is all good -- we're talki8nga bout thge apache module right?
the lisp is the only single process using more than 50MB
the lisp loader ought to build wihtout a hiccup
the lisp needs to error-check and generally desensitive itself
the lisp oldtimers all indict cmucl for that
the lisp process gets partially swapped out
the lisp should just take the times sent back from java literally and not correct for dST
the lisp tries to continue and bewm
the lisp uses to communicate with mod_webapp actually
the lisp-core I think is a real bug
the list is the pez dispenser and you are the function
the list of 1.7 folks is in projex btw under their individual entries
the list of features lined up to be developed
the list of remaining 2.0.10 bugs is managable and I'm confident it will ship in a week or two
the list of symbols you get from that .. all act as gc roots, and the more ew can trim, the lower memory consumption will be
the list of things I need to move in the van is pretty short:
the listener
the listener process seems to be warpy too
the listeners are linked to modules, or areas of functionality
the liswep subscription
the little ansi c book that costs way too much 
the little dentist is hopping mad
the little disappearing guy, right?
the little people are a legend
the little satellite dish is kind of cute though
the little shit is just ignoring me
the little slats don't have much structural strength, they just hold the walls up
the little triangles are the bullets in front of the resource types that you click to display the resources underneath them 
the load is at 1.29
the load is pegged at 4
the load it puts on my machine seems to be related to the # of connections
the load of wcof-config.lisp doesn't take place until after wco-dump is called
the load that cruisecontrol builds put on hm is pretty intermittent, rigth?
the loader is not working
the loader says it can't find files which are there
the loc changing
the local-time input widget there is busted, that fersure
the locatioms
the location check too
the location editing bug is a DST bug
the location is closed from the 24th to Jan 6th
the location mapping is turned off right now
the location of the data for Acuisition date is the same as the location for Year
the location tests will be time based
the location tests?
the log error is just it saying EVERYTHING WORKED GREAT!!!!!
the log gets trimmed, does thre invoice still display correctly?
the log is uninformative
the log says our lisp daemon wasn't listening on the port
the logging listener would produce wco-log entries which have an unrelated lifecycles to the alloc in question
the logic for displaying estimated cost is already there
the logic for how actual pickup, return, renew affect the alloc schedule that displays isn't very well worked out
the logic here is that unless the resource is checked in, you cannot mark as lost
the logic itself just guarantees that that promise can always be fulfilled
the login screen is sparkley
the logo fell down and dragged your browser window to the bottom of the screen
the logs I mean are these
the logs are displayed on allocatoin detail though
the logs look corrupt
the logs should match
the lone francophile
the long answer is,
the long delays
the long hike back to onshore
the longer you let the lines drift, the harder to merge and the more you forget *what* you want to merge
the look and feel has purty ikons
the look changed
the loose coupling is what we're after here
the lord bless you
the lord gets to eat your first frenchfry
the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
the love?
the lovely error count .. declines 
the low level scheduler regressions are inserting garbage data that kills the other tests
the low-level pin, as before, is 'aaaa'
the lru-cache is really slow pulling in alot of objects
the lru-cache-insert and lru-cache-delete funcs were added just recently, and I'm trying to remember why
the lurkey duck lurked lurkely.
the lurkey lurker lurked lurkely.
the lynster
the lyrics and ritique in this one are a bit more biting
the lyrics are nice
the mac desktop g3 that was up here - my old one
the mac guys are great, cause, yaknow, what kind of employment oportunities await mac guys.
the mac is offline too
the mac is plugged into that port
the mac version, specifically
the machine has no load on it
the machine was rebooted this morning mind you
the machinery for lookup and dispatch will need to be duplicated
the machines we have are too fast
the macro was written with a single purpose in mind, that of propping open a cconnection in order to frob
the macros for writing tests, that's it
the madness must end
the mafia wants it for 15k e
the magic of BBDB
the magic word @:)
the magyar mods to infobot ..
the mail server seems to be acting up
the mailbox for webcheckout@artcenter is funny
the mailman find_user script is nice
the main db is psql 
the main prep instance to move over is the demo right?
the main report change for 2.0 is the printer-friendly results which I'm hoping is going to be a pretty trivial IMHO change
the main thing is just undefined behavior
the maint branch
the maintenance men said i was lefty
the major contributor is that the touchpad on this laptop keeps clicking when I hitthe space bar, so my cursor in emacs jumps
the major problem is the worker thread is basically useless 
the major south side feeder highway is flooded over.  No traffic through
the make raph pay more cuz he sucks form 3
the make-rsn function handles the difference between the return and the delivery period
the makefile didn't find it
the makefile does move it, yes, but you have to run 'make redhat-install' 
the makefile rules are there
the makefiles are clever enough to know when they need to do this
the makr-rsn passes in the :start and :end argument as :usage times.  In the case of a full-day checkout, that sets the :return-time value in rsn-%data, but does not change the scheduled time.
the mall in DC is huge
the mamluk sultanate of egypt
the man actually suggests these communities police newcomers and cooperate with the feds to track sleeper cells
the man can eat it
the man gradually became more and more irritated
the man looked and said
the man of the hour
the man with the gnews
the man with the wreckin ball
the management of the policies and auths should be based on the checkout-center at which a specific resource is located
the manual is over 800 pages
the manual is too small for making it so deep
the manual wording leaves me uncertain
the mapping between ineternal and external types is needed to keep fsdb strate, so it seemed like a logical move to apply the same mechanisms to the dump
the marc editor is important because it gives them total access to their catalog data in MARC
the marc screen is just the way I pictured it @:)
the marc tab is bustd, please don't use it, it's not applicale to you anyways
the march was kinda sickly, on the sidewalk, bot very powerful.
the mark std is unclear
the market for techno here is good
the marketing dept.
the marks as symbols is indeed better
the markup beggining to end
the mashed potato option?
the masseuse gets here after the juggler leaves
the master plan is good, just trundling out the impl. sux 
the max checkout time has no relationship at all to the duration of the authorization
the max number of backend processes
the max-depth is to avoid the looping symlinks blowing it up
the may one was today's dump
the mayor of the gringos, my facility is full of gringos
the mcclim implementation is quite nice
the mco import stuff
the mco-import thing I don't know what that reference to currency was
the meaning of lice
the meaning of life is 42.
the meatball?
the meatpacking district smells of meat and bleach
the mechanics of allocation circulation are completely inscrutable
the mechanisms by which that mapping is done are myriad
the mechanisms you use above are implicit column constraints
the media button is there and it found 224 records
the media coverage of the anthrax scare is so funny
the media infrastructure is the major issue we need to get nailed down, and jesse is working on that, we should takl to him about how long he thinks it's gonna take for that.
the media is against you, they are owned by like 5 megacorps, it wa only when business formed an economic opposition to the war that the media even acknowledge the existence of the anti-war movement, and the it quickly moved to pasteurie it
the media support is runtime 
the medianet login
the medical students used scalpels to cut articles out of bound journals...
the meet US quality and safety standards
the meeting is to help them undersatnd the resource import and start off the process of rtype hierarchy planning
the mega-sum of all resource $ value was only part of the porllem
the megafuxx set is taking shape
the memeory issue with oracle is prolly some kernel parameters that we need ot put into place that got nuked with there-install
the memoization of allocation-summary needs some work, hard problem tho
the memory looks obscenely low
the menus are coming along except i have a buncha homework
the merge in allocation-core looks fine.. there are some conflicts naturally -- in indexes, get-allocaiton-renewable, should-autocirculate, some deftransition stuff isnew, %group-items
the merge is smooth enough for me to close out some bugs on the head
the merge of the branch to the head is probably a requirement
the merge point tag is wco_release_2_0_merged
the merge tag will be at the current point on the branch, wont it?
the merge tag will just sit at the base of the branch
the mergeback of c0d3rz-l@m3
the message is vague, imo
the message would be ugly
the messages.txt thingy
the messenger couldn't afford it
the metadata fucntion is slow since it needs to iterate over a list of meta-oids and delete them
the metadata package was in hindsight basically a disaster
the metadata problem is something else
the metadata replacement is next
the metadata stuff can easil be rolled back,and I am thinking it should
the metadata subsystem can't deal with that automagically?
the metadata tables are pretty huge
the metaobject stuff is done, just getting the join qualifier written
the method exists
the method i gave works for dumps created using backup-wco-data script on 2.0.x
the method is undefined for the type
the metro looked like it fell off a cliff
the mic
the microsoft dude who freaked out at the meeting
the middle room? the office in the front?
the middle step should be done autmagically I beleive by the regenerate indexes
the mighty idep network...
the migrate employee data bug is closed
the migrated data is for KU, not URI
the migrated dump-file numbering is hozed
the migration automatically rolls back on failure right?
the migration code doesnt work because Your modem doesn't speak English.
the migration failed
the migration i added wont' break anyting if it's already been run once
the migration is not so much the issue
the migration needs to be done on their server
the migration only has to run for schema changes
the migration process will take about 48 hours come 2008
the migration relies on so much framework machinery that time
the milk steamer is on
the min is a floor value per day
the ministry guy paul will be here momentarily
the mis-feature IS usage-fees, oik
the misses are so bad, but the hits are some of the best shit i've heard anywhere
the missing element?
the missing thing is a checkout
the mk:oos quoted above does not
the mobo arrived
the mocha arabica was good
the mod_webapp bit you can skip, that was RTM
the mod_webapp configuration hangs if it can't connect to an instance
the mod_webapp we use is currently unusable
the modem stands aready, lights flickering in the growing gloom
the modifying the resume thing is pretty awful
the module is  :messaging
the module is opinionlab
the module stuff should be at the wcof level anyways IMO
the module syncing I have come to regard as a useless irritation, as well as trying to care for public users of the modules
the modules are using the normal head version
the moment WO drops ObjC is the moment I drop WO.

the more I look the more I find
the more bugs in the less time, the better the preformance
the more customers we get the longer its going to take to get anything done around here too
the more dififcult merge is going to be int he GUI, because the framwork itself has been relatively solid since jesse branched
the more input you give it the scarier it will get
the more mundane the artifact, the greater connection we feel with its previous owners
the more nasal vowels is more eastern seaboard kinda..
the more sensationalist the better too.
the more specifics they have the easier they can formulate a counter-proposal.
the more the merrier

the more you hurl the more you stink
the more you know about the lower level of any device, the better you can design for it.

the most accidents happen at intersections, which is precisely whrere bike lines suck, because they make novice cyclists try and do stupid shit, and they confuse the relation between bike and car when car is turning right
the most important are in session.lisp
the most important one is to update ethe actual umich task of course
the most important things are probably the temporary manage-fees capability for window workers on return

the n-tiers of a clown?
the name begins with an 'l'
the name is long it is descriptive & accurate.  I guess I would argue for it,
the name is mildly corny
the name is so i can look up how
the name of that box is osh200-200.onshore.com
the name of the method implies that it should right?
the name with arguments nil patch might serve well there
the named pipe process gets a blocking read on the data while it's still be written right?
the named that computer after me, cause i'm so er33t

the network running over the phones?
the network summary, as well as the status update I sent last yesterday
the network went down
the networks are less bogged, and there is no central server
the networks will shit if they don't get the promised shock and awe
the new Beck album is booty-shake-a-licious

the newer version of slib does not have slibconfig, so now I can't configure slib, but installation does not die
the newest c-l-c conflicts with cmucl less than 3.0.0 so I figured I would update the cmucl interface to c-l-c appropriatly
the news I'm talking about is technical things -- releases, advisories, major updates to docs
the news on www.onshored.com ends a year ago
the newsworthyness is that random joes have cracked an algorithm at a given key length. If Distributed Net can do it with volounteers, the NSA can do it.

the nice part about getting swamped with this crap is the days fly past 
the nice part will be, being able to specify tree transforms
the nice thing about 2.1, AFAIK, is that it lays right on top of 2.0.x
the nice thing about cvs-pcl is also that it will update your buffers from cvs automatically i8f they are alraedy open
the nice thing about electronic music is that it's getting a wider audience
the nice thing about exporting the results is they can just run a huge query and tailor all the results themselves in access or filemaker

the nice thing is if i'm dj'ing it's a guarantee that it won't be crowded
the nice thing is once SAIC is migrating properly i think that will have shaken out 98% of possible data anachronisms
the nice thing is that 2.1 doesn't involve any schedule core changes...
the nice thing is the generality...
the nicest of the interfaces

the o'reilly html book worked well for me
the obj_oid would be nice too for that matter
the object in memory does not point to an editing context either
the object is not marked when modified
the object self or whatever...
the objective material conditions are the strongest force for change
the objects are cached somewhere?
the odbc access is going to have to be specially handled in 2.1 I believe
the odcl issue is the only troubling bit
the odcl::stores unbound thing looks like there was a session active when we went down through the runlevels

the one you want to connect to?
the one's he sent in yesterday were on 2.0.9 and they are going to be using the new invoice section in 2.0.10.  I should still file those right?

the only different was that you added wco-drop-and-prep
the only docs that should currently have center just already are angela's...stuff she's responsible for
the only downside is that turnaround for fixes will be longer
the only downside to that is if you reduce to a 3-letter, you think

the only people that may have needs are eric and dan
the only place i see them is on unreturned allocations
the only place i'm aware of is on find-allocation screen 
the only place that changed that I'm aware of is invoicing
the only place that kind of thing has ever happened is in the applet
the only place the control-nodes call is ever used is in the context of an allocation with does actually have a controlling relation to the resource data
the only possible point of suspicion was that there was an update-dump-from-freeze change but the instances were not remigrated
the only possible problem is if someone ie editing patrons while you import them, at least, that's my blind guess
the only problem I gotta get nailed is that when editing marc control fields , there is some off by one string indexing operations

the only really scarey thing about make is trying to figure out dependancy crap, IMHO
the only realy bad problem in the 3.0 release is the cant view overdue chaeckouts bug right?
the only reason I can think you would get that is if it's checked out now
the only reason I like def-marc is that it's a fairly simple declaration of the MARC field and subfields
the only reason I'm asking is because a squeaky-wheel customer is asking for it
the only reason navbar was DHTML in the firstplace was those silly faked tooltip things
the only reason we ever need admin is mod_webapp upgrade
the only reason we have them at all is for some contact data
the only record he asked to have his name removed from
the only reset is committing the bitch, or reset button
the only rreason i said nay was because it didn't work out of the proverbial box
the only significant one not in there is the marc import breakages
the only significant thing that has changed is that the indexes are not controlled solely by edits of indexed-objects.
the only software that should pretend to be your friend is opus
the only status-2 anywhere in the framework was in the default configuration file
the only sucky part was the slow ass pserver connecction
the only tarkovsky I ever saw I really dug

the only thing I could really gather...
the only thing I did was move the tag

the only thing I just noticed is that if you stop the instance over and over in debian it doesn't complain
the only thing I know that's real slow is the group editing
the only thing I might want is the resource location
the only thing I miss is the rollovers on the status bar icon
the only thing I wonder is if your looking for instance for usage summary data or such..
the only thing I would suggest is looking at the services and making sure junk you don't want is off
the only thing Im working on here with these designers is that its a mac shop..
the only thing better than a fresh bari sub is a day old bari sub
the only thing done so far is there's a gensym on each instance .. the idea being the UI could identify subnodes that way
the only thing dumber than slashdot is me^H^H someone who reads it everyday and complains about how dumb it is
the only thing holding me back now is the fact that I gotta get the demo dataset loading resources 8)
the only thing i can think of is cucumber slushees 
the only thing i could think of would be if the policy was temporarily enabled

the only thing i didn't do was the page names..
the only thing i saw was the duplicate allocation_metadata on repeat reservations
the only thing in 2.0.2 is the max renewal count
the only thing is that I'm not sure it works, because it makes an identifier context dependent
the only thing is that distribution is all analo nowadays
the only thing is, I can't figure out why it is complaining about that
the only thing is...
the only thing it doesn't do is kill a screen session if it has other windows open
the only thing not in installing-webco.txt as I understand it is the bind editing
the only thing really is that setting the accoutn code on the alloc screens should make the invoice into a recharge type
the only thing that might get fried is the cable modem, which belongs to AT&T
the only thing that really annoys me about dancehouse is the absolute homophobia
the only thing that sez 'postgres' is USER
the only thing that sucks is prolly my changes came in on top of his
the only thing that varies in imho between frozen and head is form-elements.lisp
the only thing that was happening on the server was time-sync for 16 hours
the only thing then is to ensure it doens't due a time conversion for us 8)
the only thing we can do is make sure the allocations they link too have their schedule-rules migrated to allocate objects propah

the only things that changed btw 2.0.3 and head is debian pkg stuff
the only things you can do to a recharge invoice are .. journal it and add charges
the only think I can think of is setting a prefix variable in ssi
the only think I havent done is deleted everything and reinstalled it
the only think I heard was the edit buttons on the confirmation screens making things ugly
the only think I'm worried about is the blocker

the only time i've ever tested with real data was over the network from the usc db
the only time to use head is when you need a tag for checking diffs
the only time you need it is if you're trying to quote a comma...
the only time you need this translation defined explicitely is when it's the stupid debian package or redhat package being loaded
the only time you would need to update anything by hand is if you were modifying the queue tables, which as far as I no you do not ever need to do
the only tricky bit is that we're so  close to 2.0
the only tricky bit is the setup of the pgsql
the only true copy protection is SCMS
the only true solution is skateboarding on the sidewalk.
the only var there I think is the lisp interpreter
the only water you can drink with a fork!
the only way bitchx protects from chanerr is you can tell which channel whomever you are responding to are on
the only way i could think of that happening is if User B was committed to the database with the same OID as User A ... and that seems highly unlikely
the only way i'd go back to 15 is if there was a G3 laptop attached
the only way it has been is as ... a schedule root, effectively?
the only way now is to parse it into a local-time then use that to initializa a wall-time
the only way to do it is what I said, compare 1.8.6 vs 2.0
the only way to fix it is to break it
the only way to get one in there is via resource import
the only way to know if it is sufficient is to try it
the only way to runt he transponder code is thru the applet or thru some hanrolled stubbies
the only way to stop it is to transfer all their money out 
the only way we can get more money is by bringing on more customers
the only wierd thing is how subsections are not italicized but chapters and sections are
the only wierd thing on the demo schedule is that it doesn't show up on view weekly schedules
the only words he got right were muy bien and yo
the only work around is to cancel existing reservation and re-enter all the data
the ons Skylarov kracked?
the onshore limo's in the shop
the onshore rule #7 situation will always stand out as one of the defining moments of onshore for me
the onyl reason I knoew the answer is that I came across this problem about a week ago!
the onyl reason there are three is because it made converting things easier 8)
the onyl times you can edit are pre-confirmation and checkout-return
the oompas were funny
the open 1.7 things are trivialities
the open auth thing?
the open blockers are still valid right?
the open pairs storage is the sticking point, since we use the event time as part of the key
the open-close hours in the locatione_regime_temporal table not the location_temporal table?
the opening band sucked so bad though i wasnt' sure if they were ripping off u2 or u2 by way of radiohead
the opening line of the email: Do you like Hot Beastie Sex?
the operation he describes is the java serialization to applet of reosurces one
the operator is unavailable at this time. This mailbox is disabled. This mailbox is full and connot accept new messages. Exiting the system
the operator lookup table you made ricks
the opposite does not follow either
the opposite manner....please clarify.
the opposite of 'will return' is 'will not return'
the opposite, when there is a reservation, bu the object was not returned yet
the opposite?
the opposition is too timid
the opus brain crap, it spreads out
the opus knows
the ora data is only on alpha, however
the oracle bullshit on alpha
the orange
the orangey one is a little more realistic 
the order of eval issue is only on a scale of particular granulatiry, evaluation of files and or forms
the order?
the org ownership is there because is it in SAIC's authorization model
the organizers of the rally were pushed aside, there were at least a hundred cops to handle a 20 person antiwar feeder march to the rally, and they were picking people with anitwar buttons or flyers from the march.
the orgs called are primarily those most dependent upon city support, woemna nd children service orgs, a youth org, and a mosque
the origin is only on the person.  person and group are tied by person.userid ==> group.name
the origin of conciousness is a worthy ionvestigation
the origin of consciousness in the Separation 
the origin of consciousness?
the origina of the problem IMO is that there is not an element class which operates inthe reuqest response loop for those things which are not producing HTML output
the original location exists not but there is still qvimbys on north avenve
the original problem remains as stated
the original was blank...not our fault
the original?
the origional.  It is freaky
the other ..about loading over existing data?
the other 115 were killed by the gas the army pumped in to knock out the terrorists
the other 14 do not.
the other 94% are getting by on sugar and caffeine
the other alternative is to get the network working for it
the other anyone can get, relating to the resource import
the other approach smacks of desparation and costs us...
the other car got a scratch on the bumper
the other concern is that updating umich sucks up an insane amount of developer time
the other diff is that the older one had cmu17 in its features and the new one does not
the other errors are ignorable unless you are migrating the wco_log table 
the other examplee is EXACLTY THE SAME
the other field is covered by author-name
the other fun thing about the init scripts in 3.0 is that you can start them as the instance user
the other girl was late today cos her dad was beating up cops at ohare
the other guy, not sure ... prolly repair or something
the other half is a legit migration error that I am trying to track down
the other is new
the other is on the prior page
the other is that if you add or re-eval a define-index it needs to be re-initialized the same way
the other is that it has a type problem
the other is that some don't have CREATE temporals
the other is that we're not a bunch of swill swallowing shills under 5 ft tall
the other is to define a property for the field that has a reader that that returns it in the presentation type, as well as a type specifer and :field-group spec
the other is:
the other issue the ability to complex jos to tie up the server
the other militiary branch
the other nice thing about the co-op is browsing the class reading lists
the other old guy
the other one is fixed already, gotta mke sure it's in CVS
the other one relates to assuring sometihg is dumping correctly
the other one was his linux wkstation and i dont' think there was anything critical on it but i could check with him 
the other one wighs as much as i do
the other one, about incorrect auth failure message, is fishy and I've aked for more info
the other one, fsdb package context, I am having difficulty recreating consistently and am currently trying to track it down
the other one, i haven't even read yet.  if you want to grab it, by all means do so.
the other part is getting find-forms to display export formats again, not hard
the other part is how it hooks into object creation modification
the other place was doing a special $40 four course meal
the other popular is apache-ssl
the other problem is that I'm not sure how stable the new invoice stuff is
the other reason for using BCC is that it prevents cross-talk when Client X responds to the email and CC's Client Y
the other restaurant that looked good on Cermak was a Capone hangout
the other says lois-spec
the other solution is a set of entity caches, and rewriting parts of iris and other import tools that use the find-or-create... funcs in import-utils, but that doesn't address the issue as a whole, because then we have to have this invisible hand all over the place ensuring non-repeating userids and labels and such, as opposed to a simple, reliable check in wcof-create that works regardless of ho
the other solution will just kick our ass down the line
the other stuff I just build a single list out of, preserving subfield ordering
the other stuff goes fairly quick
the other stuff has died down.
the other stuff is just 'true' : the renewal count is reached, etc
the other thing I was going was fixing surrogates.  I had a nifty idea of iterting the in meeory number backwards from zero
the other thing aboug KU is we did a one-time migration of :note metadata to the :department field, so it's probably a moot issue
the other thing about 3665 is that it's a back-port change to the wco_release_2_0_3 tag I think
the other thing is more person import
the other thing is that I'd like you to take a look at the security station topics I just finished up, in your spare time that is...
the other thing is to upgrade to 2.5 or a 2.4 with a backpatch of Large File support
the other thing is we are supposed to email their sysadmin any changes we make to that box
the other thing to note is that policy not being set at all, and set at the default, are exactly the same thing
the other thing you could do
the other thing you may need to redo is rethread the instance argument thrua  func or two.  I don't think I took it out of anywhere that needed it, but since I didn't generate event lists from checkouts I couldn't tell
the other two were earlier I thought
the other two, they run end to end all night
the other was a rabbit
the other way around tho 8)
the other way would be to have the interface handle multiples 
the other, you have to take away his baby before bed
the other?
the others are just too ... rectangular
the others are lcsh etc.
the others have been fixed
the others in the thread are very politic, and Jason is probably just naive.
the others probably won't care 
the others would have been negative
the others, there's no gain
the outages last night
the outfield ?
the outline I sent
the output is pretty non-specific .. it's seems to be some sort of circ policy error in validation-strings
the output is still wrong
the output of exec t?
the output of my new supah' cheap video card is both sharp and colorful
the output of the inventory export does not import
the overarching mgmt issue still is there
the overcapacity is very new, so they won't tear it down and replace it.

the overlapping nodes bug is too serious
the overlapping nodes error doesn't even show up for this one overlap
the overlapping schedule node issue 
the overlapping?

the overwhelming number of broken things
the oyster thing is auntie anna-banana
the package always includes them
the package has an alias :wcof, but not the system, which is why it is not finding the system
the package is not compiled or loaded
the package is owned by webcheckout
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
the package is wcof-tests
the package name
the package name is 'mailman'
the package you want will be navigator-smotif-477 or something
the packages are in ~webcheckout...
the packaging is too tsarist for my taste
the packaging one?
the packets slam into eachother and fall out the bottom of the modem
the pad
the page for Informaton>Your Visit is the same template as the page for Conservation Center
the page is just frame-page
the page is set to 100%, but the printout looks teeny
the page is too wide?
the page on clc :: the page on clc
the page on clc?
the pages were doing should be done already...
the painter, not the power tools
the paki-indian cab stop we got some good grub from, complete with prayer room
the pakistan thing looks really tenuous
the pakistani papers on Devon are chock full of services for relocating to Canda

the part up to and including the ':' is the 'host'
the part where the old lady says I could never eat a bug and then immediately after she says that, she eats a bug
the part?
the partial resource import, what is the deal with that? only partial?
the particular feature, th freebie eric account code entry feature, is what is breaking circulaing forms right now
the particular was, a long time ago: hmm, t - expression - form - string - bound-string - catalog-entry - media-format
the partitions are hda1, hda2, etc
the party is over
the party is over haha
the party is over!
the party thing is in september
the passcode sucked
the password didn't change however
the password didn't work before because it is, in fact, not the password for 'ecsedym'
the password for ucla@prep is in passes
the password for user webcheckout listed in passes.gpg does not work with when playip3 is booted into potato 
the password in passes doesnt seem to work
the password is same as gopher?
the past 24 hours has sucked pretty hard for me
the patch I wrote in LBApplication is not working.
the patch didnt work?
the patch fixes that as well
the patch is wrong, it is fixed correctly
the path is oging to be system-dependant...
the pathos
the patron class in question, the system will trickle down until it hits the other class.  Thus if you don't care to set a per-patron-class policy on a resource type, you can just stick with the other class and that will apply to all patrons. 
the patron classes are a whole nother shit-kebab
the patron detail property sheet
the patron text box.
the patron-active-check  is straightforward; just checks person.status, and works
the patrons that is
the paul graham nerds article is full of good quotes
the pause is probably making the cell connection
the pay is shit anyow
the pcmcia-cs and pcmcia-modules-2 are both rather important IMHO

the people who sit in front of my house are jackasses
the people-import regression tests are kind of limited
the peotry readers threatened to turn it into an evening of reading the anti-war and anti-capital poetry of Langston Hughes and Wordsworth who were the topics of the reading.
the per day maximum is kinda stumping me beause what if they have periods over 24 hours?  
the perfect music! finally!
the perms on that dir is probably wrong...
the perplexing thing is that those paths worked on my machine with the stuff peter was setting up for translations for cl-library and cl-system
the person errors were immediately at the beginning
the person is imported regardless of expiry
the person problem is weird
the person table has other fields in it that they don't see
the person that wrote that script wasn't a strong db guy
the person who exports the file could be smoking crack
the person's status is set to :deleted
the person-detail is really browsing-oeiented
the person-detail right-frame was never displayed
the person-detail screen was reformatted with a property-sheet ... that's when it got lost

the phone is probably the same ... 
the phone jail needs work, and I'm not sure if I like the way the support hunt group works.  Tho without josh in the office it might be hard to fine tune it
the phone rang once.
the phonefield has to be autopopulated from the Contact Name
the phones are already ringing
the phones are screwy too
the photo page is a good idea, chiyoko
the photo probably won't even make it into the magazine
the photos are one of the most stunning collections of images I've ever seen. they have almost 200 of them. original prints.
the photos in the tribune were fairly shocking ... 
the photos page is good
the phrase delightfully morose comes to mind everytime i listen to Belle & Sebastian
the physical location is not imported
the pichurs I just snapped are now on line
the pick up truck icon if you will
the pickup and return options need to be initialized to set and strike but then should be able to be switched around post-facto and remembered
the pickup and return time have to fault in full schedule data as well
the pickup case is handled diff because pickup time cheanges to now
the pickup is a bit broken...
the pictures mean:
the pidfile should contain the instance name somewhere in it's filename
the pieces are getting bigger and easier to put together

the pin buttons are free to submit anything anywhere ..
the pin nightmare would go away
the pin rpobelms in 2.0.3 alone are serious enough
the pin you have should have capability to do that, yes
the pina colada song
the pine on queso has changed
the ping outs they spread out and turn on
the pink has got to go
the pins on the map that is?
the pious stance of it
the pizza did it
the pkg doesn't use .cmucl-init.lisp
the pkg stuff is blocked now because wco-dump doesn't work
the pkg upgrade bug?
the pkg works now
the pkg you need is 'wenglish' -- ienglish is hte ispell dictionary

the plan *is* to move to that but we just haven't had a chance to work out the deployment logistics yet
the plan is more program
the plan is to fet a subwoofer and crank Ozzy
the plan is to hck it in the short term, and then remove acad-career and acad-level formpeople-import and relace it with patron-class
the plan was to make the closed periods shorter-looking
the planet could be run by monkeys by now

the pleasant weather over the weekend brought me much joy 
the pleasure, as always, is mine

the plot is so subtle really
the plot would be like a bunch of nihilist anarchists road-tripping across eastern europe on their way to a SoM concert in St. Petersburg
the plural of eMac is ...
the point is heh punctuated equilibrium .. remove the evolutionary mistakes!
the point is that whereas
the point is they can't print from the app
the point is to have the storage specification evolve slowly
the point is to work on migration no?
the point is, like, that whereas
the point is, though, that pollo ought to make outgoing connections from its own IP, not one of its multihomed ones
the point is...
the point of the checklist is to make sure that we cover the basics
the point of the checklist, like the test suite, is simply to prevent us from seeing the same bug over and over
the point of the exercise is to prevent having to display the half megabyte checkbox graveyard
the point of the language is the syntax and macro system
the point?
the pointer is the entity which controls or is effected by that schedule node
the police are up in something
the police just decided to give us the ticket
the police use that to justify every time they lose control.
the policies are all zeroed out at the rtype level, overriding the checkout center, but it's only for those 3 rtypes
the policies are getting set right, but the screen always shows the policy for :other
the policies at org level only apply when logge dinto a CC operated by that ORG.  it never has anything to do with the owning org of the rtype
the policies functionality is the first to come to mind.
the policy bug is fixed and Im lookign at the MOTD migration bug.  Looks trivial
the policy you use determines wether it is on the same invoice or not

the present plan is to hold people on 1.7.2 that don't have a pressing need for features in 1.8.1 to stay where they are
the presentation is the little boxes you click on
the presentation system defines a set of presentation classes, which are not necesarrily real CLOS classes, but map onto the tree of classes in IMO
the presentation-type used could conceivably be an optional keyword in such case, if not provided you can ask the value what ptype to use.

the previous comment wasn't so mucha  complaint as much as a gripe 8)
the previous one was not video ape, it was dumbass nigger front front rappity rap
the previous pay period was delayed, and checks were handed out rather than deposited
the previously existing handlers are still registered with the low-level event-listener interface
the price is garbage

the primary key mismatched with actual columns?

the principle is to unify configuration management as close to the root as possible
the principle of least surprise bit is mostly done, running into some issue with login having to determine what screen people get before they are at a particular location
the principle was to solve a rebus puzzle...
the print form ones please, and the pickup one, which may or may not be related
the print out I have here..
the printable html on the head is pretty tight IIRC
the printer
the printer is grunting
the printer is lowing
the printer is what again?
the printer pings
the printer runs SNMP, not the computer
the printer, 3E
the printers all show up as pingable
the printing module should a. watch for reservation & pickup events b. for each of these, see if prinitng is wanted c. print if needed
the printing prolly slowed you down alot too
the printouts are such an ass pimple
the printserver idea has been scrapped completely
the private auto should not be allowed in the city IMO accept under parituclar circumstances
the private sector makes better cheese
the prob here is the tree-node nil
the probelm is that it is not deleting the last temporal node of a regime
the probelm might arrise if you have an invoice with a partial payment against it, then you try to wave a line-item that would make the invoice negative
the probelm pam was able to reproduce is likely a misunderstanding about the org criterion in the find-rtype search
the problem I'm running into is the handling of surrogate values for unserialized items
the problem as i know it is i get WCOF Error: Container node not found
the problem for me was it was not in emacs till 20.5 i thknk
the problem is I can't find any innovators
the problem is a sort and unique on a large data set, and I'm not sure how to optimize that
the problem is all the weird conditions that might cause something to wind up in the report
the problem is any validation code would be unable to differentiate them to
the problem is between 1.6 and 1.6.2 if you tried to edit condition note of a resource
the problem is coming from invoice_temporal, it is expecting it to have a surrogate field
the problem is dag's bookmark 
the problem is digital recording loses an infinite amount of data, compared to analogue, which only loses a finite amount
the problem is having new-allocation exist within a single session transaction
the problem is i need to write the code to fix the iris import
the problem is i think she lives within the walls of my basement
the problem is i've been doing it for so long, i've started to empathize with the customers
the problem is in %scheduler-deallocate
the problem is in the applet
the problem is it fails
the problem is it won't overwrite any form elements that might be on the screen
the problem is likely that the alloc is failting int he patron slot befor ethe people are there
the problem is making money
the problem is more interseting than the solution
the problem is mysql seems somewhat reluctant to work on prep
the problem is not everybody adheres to the store-property interface
the problem is not that the column is misnamed, it's that the CREATE statement is wrong in the dumps
the problem is probably I can't find any innovators
the problem is prolly in copy-meta
the problem is prolly that I did not commit that utils.lisp with the right version before tagging
the problem is telling it which IP to use
the problem is that I changed the default :db-kind to :base, but forgot to tell standard-db-object those were virtual, will commit
the problem is that I specify it, and you all ignore it
the problem is that cameras are not going to be out
the problem is that enteract sucks donkey dick
the problem is that for one, it should not check already established reservations
the problem is that his statement of opinion on the matter was wrongly taken as a statement of intent on behalf of the Debian project
the problem is that i use prep to store all RPMS so it's annoying to move pkgs via extra hop
the problem is that in this case the word PAID is missleading
the problem is that it was previously unbound, it no longer is unbound
the problem is that it's cycling thru a bunch of dead connections to mod webapp instances
the problem is that mp::process-wait-with-timeout wants a string as it's first arg, but is getting a process object
the problem is that ns.onshore.com appears to be down or unreachable
the problem is that read is called on an open stream and there is a pending write on another unrelated stream that has been closed ..
the problem is that rtypes are global and policies are not
the problem is that something is varying with the 'test' handling on uchi box for some reason
the problem is that the mistake I made was repeated in several places by me and jesse
the problem is that the open groups don't have an open type
the problem is that the wwwgants parsers are expecting different output than what they are getting
the problem is that there are some fields WITH values in the db which are not found by the sql query
the problem is that uw-popd's use of APOP is crappy and would force us into complete parallel passwd mgmt  -- 2 passwords
the problem is that we don't have icons for them :)
the problem is that we have multiple blocks on the same LAN, one of which 206.69.90 is routed thru their PIX firewall
the problem is that we shared-initialize creates a new find-people-form
the problem is that when LockboxArchiver tries to fork, it's dying cause it's resident footprint is > 200MB
the problem is that wmetho is a struct
the problem is that you can't change a person'd department easily
the problem is that your listener is in the user package, and there is no class 'bug-category in the user class
the problem is the :before gave a garbled command to smbclient.
the problem is the dropfile is truncated
the problem is the iris data automatically creates orgs and locs
the problem is the manufacturer field of the returned resource is nil
the problem is the total only looks for late fees not usage fees
the problem is there are conceivably 6 separate metadata lookups per record
the problem is there is no way to get a reference to the current wcof session from within usql 
the problem is there is not really any obvious place to implement the fix 
the problem is there's no way to get a document into memory without loading it in the browser
the problem is they have to wait for a DNS timeout if they don't have a station specified 
the problem is they use NAT 
the problem is trying to handle multiples
the problem is wco cannot tell the difference between rounded-up policy and no policy
the problem is we hacked all this invoice crap onto the branch for them
the problem is we use it for assignment and relation
the problem is you create the station when you click the Create Station link
the problem is, I haven't heard anything from HR about him, and I
the problem is, that I'm one of the phalanx
the problem isthat you are in the wrong package
the problem just has to do with table ordering in the query used to bbuild deposit totals, which is not something we can change in EOF
the problem now is a missing defun for wcof::fake-person
the problem seems to be NOTICE -> MARC
the problem that i am seeing in 2.0.x is when you have a few months worth of past expire-reservation temporals stacked up in the db, when you restart the server the application tries to re-expire them all
the problem there is version dependency in java serialization.  We could go to an XML based communications mechanism XML-RPC, which Gecko will integrate with nicely
the problem tho karl, is that you can't define wcof::*webcheckout-database-user* at .cmucl reading time
the problem was I had done wco-instantiate but not wco-instantiate-admin
the problem was I was migrating orgs with a bad fine-rate
the problem was experienced in the pkg context btw
the problem was in the handling of hier indexes, and their use of a subselect
the problem was on HEAD only as far as I know
the problem was really no food yesterday aside from that 1 sandwich
the problem was simply that I was trying to change something incorrect in the summary
the problem was that rtype-subtypes would include repeats, AND itself in the results
the problem was that the machinery for doing that was never working properly, because the db-writer slot option was not working
the problem was that with-impunity was not definedin time
the problem we have now is that any allocations that would have been in the broken state the bug reported, would have been repaded adn cancelled
the problem with DMC is their current resource management software is custom-designed for them so it's kind of a stretch for them to understand how webcheckout is better
the problem with algorithmic composition is that everything sounds like it was written by an equation
the problem with averages is that, normally, they are quite average
the problem with being a critical sensation in germany is that i can never quite make out the extremity of the platitudes bestowed upon me
the problem with branching 3.0 now is the unnecessary work -- moving all cvs instances and most developers to the branch
the problem with centralized DBs
the problem with her is essentially that I cannot keep track of what she's been trained on and what she hasn't, thus I have to assume she has been trained on it all
the problem with most websites is that anyone bothers reading them at all
the problem with person import does cause serious waste of time...
the problem with postponing is that merging goes better if you remember why things were done
the problem with putting hippies in one
the problem with tabular is that the column headings would be to small to really let it be, uh, self-explanatory
the problem with the first is determining when objects are re-indexed.
the problem with the upgrades is the fragility with the center schedules
the problem with utexas was that it was not 3.0
the problem with writing tests for this bug is that it's just a matter of data not meeting the expectation of the interface
the problem with xptest is that report-result gives different answers if :handle-errors is nil or t
the problem witht hat is that he refuses to disagnose or fix shell scripts
the problem you're working on is diff from a segfault
the problem?
the problems with the doing it in the router are obvious
the problm is that the in memory data structure for hierachical indexes will be lame when it's something rather flat like that index is
the problmem there was that darrin didn't know to hit the return key in the person id field
the probrem with writing soap teat is that there are too many sensitive people here
the procedure is still wonked in that it died so..
the procedure is weird there iac
the procedures are so simple and yet very complex -- difficult info design 
the process did not exist, that's all
the process of commiting a reservation will reveal the conflicts for the repeats
the process of makinga  reservation is awkward
the producers should have come up with a merchandise deal as soon as the pilot got approved
the production directory still has no CVS
the production is the patron for the alloc
the production site has not been updated
the productions table is the roughest, I don't consider it defined yet 8)
the profiler barfs if the tbc counter rolls past fixnum
the profiler says that 30 seconds is spent in rendering functions and 30 seconds is spent in read-int16
the progn doesn't doa nything
the progn will always be executed after the progv, so that if an error occurs inside, the old binding will be restored
the program crashed and adam turned of the ftp daemon
the program i'm using to ul the images only uses ftp
the program we were looking for won't work, even if we find it
the program you need to run is ttssh.exe
the project webpage
the projected release dates are clearly documented -- see the projex file
the projex file is pretty up-to-date but the date for 2.0 is obviously wrong
the projex last updated for umich instance is wrong then I hope
the projex thing
the proliferation of such functions are due to a need to customize something that is not sufficiently abstracted yet
the proper cmucl version is 1.18 or something
the proper demo 
the proper solution it to truncate that propah
the proper spelling of Wookiee is wookiee
the proper syntax would also be :
the proper way to do it would be to throw up an error or wanring, or otherwise log data that was not migrated, at least specifying what entity and property it was.
the proper way would be to see if there is a hold on the person or production if specified in alloc-rules
the property for invoice for example is :allocation 
the property labels are valigned top 
the property sheet based doesn't work well with marc records, adam, i gotta fix that up
the property sheet mapping could possible handle this
the property sheets feature is the ability to put the fields into edit mode then?
the property type overridden in the search results spec, perhaps?
the property-sheet-spec says its to be rendered as an allocation-link
the proposal is both?
the proposal isn't that bad is it?
the proposed scheme would be:
the proprietary license is there to provide friction, and we don't need the friction in this case
the protagonist Allocation is very empathetic
the protected abstract void between my ears
the protocol is simple: you get ALL capabilities possessed by a person, and check each for an approval
the protocol the framework provides is too provide a higher level interface that what we're talking about
the prototype tends to creep into production :)
the prototypical emo rock band
the proverbial one
the ps command you want to use is setpagedevice
the ps tools aren't pty ready
the psoft migration works, but it needs a mod to ld_library_path
the psoft ones are easy
the psoft or the tzone
the psoft runs at midnight.. when it finishes running, it requeues itself for next midnight
the psoft test coverage may have caught this, but it was a subtle one
the psych they always have on the news and etc
the public restrooms here are full of ladyboys
the public servants
the publicity won't really help us all that much, considering the audience
the punch line to one of my favorite jokes is, you idiot, I said 'posse'
the purple one!
the purpose of the bursar's fine account # was to fulfill a specification :)
the purpose of the project was to make email widely available
the pyro cannons are conspiciously absent from that stage plot too
the pzone is blocking my release
the qualifier is not getting applied is all
the quality isn't too much better at this bitrate
the queers are building landing strips for gay martians.
the queries will not really operate on the DB, int he sense of doing table selects
the query is no longer very complicated
the query mechanism will eventually be entirely in memory
the query result stuff never goes thru the EC
the query stuff is all working now, I just have some problems displaying the results and mapping u-texas stuffinto MARC appropriately
the query stuff was never quite finished on Friday
the query that returns the whole DB that is, including making the objects.  Not bad for a64M P90
the quesiton I'm not sure of is this: should we stage or just import the new marc file?
the questino is, if we're going to shoulder more payroll, where should it be...
the question
the question in my mind is how and if to handle the compilation of the .lisp files on pkg install time...
the question in my mind is whethe rfind tickets, ticket info should be under resources
the question in my mind, is whether the framework is dealing with corruped alloc data in the most liberal way
the question is can you assoc a dvd and a vhs with a single bibliographic record
the question is for 2.0.1
the question is how to deal with the bad data...
the question is how to make the pathname xlation...
the question is moot
the question is what are we gonna do
the question is what bugs in 2.0.x need to be fixed in the shorter term so we can put it in maint mode ?
the question is what is a dept's attribs...
the question is what productions are you in -- which production are you checking this out for?
the question is whether our assessment that the problem is CMUCL signal handling is borne out or not
the question is whether you can find a test to cause it regularly
the question is, like, how to make the pathname xlation
the question is, what is the text
the question is, will this help me?
the question is...
the question is... should we take some of the 1.8 bugs out so we can get this damn release done?
the question kinda becomes, what puts an existing reservation or checkout into edit mode
the question not answered -- how is a half day defined?
the question on a per-page basis
the question still out there:
the question to me is whether a stranger reading that would consider us a hero or a heel
the question was latently smartass
the question what is their operative convention?
the question....
the questions are really much too technical for me, I don't think I can answer them
the questnos are going to be about what search criteria and results need to display exactly
the quetions they asked me I can't answer right now
the queue
the queue only runs for 2 seconds at a time
the queue tables
the queue, then send-em-all approach works so much faster than the web version
the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
the quick cinapps import is ONLY in cinapps-interface.lisp in 2.0.9.2
the quick one is only run manually
the qumari's are like hey where is our defense minister
the quotes are winding up escaped but the parens arent
the rack above the other records or was it just stuck in the pile
the radiators are on
the rain in spain falls mostly on the spaniards
the ram is maxed out at 191712k
the random select is NOT a feature for them as far as I know, it has not been implemented
the random stuff is based on those...
the randomly disappearing rsrc issue I think was filed elsewhere too -- I think it is that some rsrcs with sched conflicts sometimes wont' come up in the crapplet thus you can't remove them from the allo
the range of my vocab is expanding eh!
the rap superstar
the rat began to gnaw the rope
the rate of what?
the rates are calculated per-business-day
the rates of lending are now *below* inflation -- basically, free money between banks
the rationale contributes to how interest is formulated by the agents
the rationale for subsidies is that it's not econ. feasible to produce dairy otherwise, right?
the rationale is: there are many places we keep an explicit time value and very few where we need to do math with intervals that cross TZ transitions correctly
the rationale of the bug is to basically clean  up and unify the configuration of possible states and transitions in invoices
the rats of nimh
the rats were right outside our door in the stairwell
the raverbar society is sorta falling apart
the raw power!
the rbcdf eh
the reader macro doesn't seem to be invoked
the reader process opens the file for read
the reaktor discussion is actually run by the company that makes the software too
the real bug is that they should be able to look int he iface and say, oh, I haven't been in the import
the real deal
the real distinction it has is that it contains a full mechanical action, wooden keys and plate.
the real face of globalization is in fact the opposite -- worsening living standards
the real fix is in wco, not calling parse-timestring iwth invalid syntax
the real priority is to get pg there for him
the real problem with 2066 has to do with the dema data set I'm sure
the real solution is IP access
the real solution is to find out who is setting it incorrectly
the real solution to their problem is substituting one rsrc for another at pickup time, which is something which is already there in 2.1, for media anyhow
the real spiderman was such a better character, even if you just read one comic book
the real test will be umich
the reality check is coming. the markets are stressed.
the really awful thing about new-allocation is how slow it is...  the way it runs the availabilty check on the reousrces
the realms where the bravest tester dare not go
the reaper as well
the reaper cancells them
the reaper kills a reservation exactly the same as a user deleting it, I believe
the reaper will now skip over bad allocs while tell you about them
the reaping happens automagically
the reason I don't like the idea is that hte major features section in 2.0 is going to be buried lower and lower
the reason I was mentioning waffling is that we had a previous interface that would have supported this, but it has been thrown out
the reason being that that method is defined on a new parent class for metadata pvals, and wco-metadata should be a descendant of that
the reason being that they think that a painted line will protect them from being hit from behind bya  car, their greatst fear
the reason being that while postgres supports nesta transactions, an abort will roll ALL of them back up to the top, not just the innermost one, while a commit commits just the innermost one
the reason for that is that groups are transient, resauth-rules are not
the reason for thelarge non dhcp range was anticipating a DMZ
the reason gary saw that bug in groups on demo was because create-demo-authorizations authorizes 1 patron against every resource type
the reason i ask is because dell is shippiing new servers with red hat 8
the reason is that the find-form from which it derives and handles the rendering is a form
the reason is to group several resources together, and manager users access to them as a unit
the reason is: In many cases it has prevented being able to even find the logic problems.
the reason it disappeared is that the context was likely reset, or the app restarted after migration
the reason it only shows up on umich is that I don't have printing on my instance!
the reason it's a pain is that my phone is trying to charge 
the reason mofos cannot edit reservation on a reservation with repeats
the reason my enteract install went bad was Ameritech checked the connection to the wrong network and then couldn't be bothered to come back out again
the reason the response is so huge  appears to be that one of the rtypes has a shitload of resources under it's first level BTW
the reason we're not in testing according to the support site is because we're in internal testing only
the reason why filing bugs takes me so long is that I have a guilt complex about it and I try to fix them myself first
the reboot message
the rebus solution was 'snake charmer' ... he was actually swinging a cane ...
the receipt # is just for payments
the recent Palestine 4 arrests were based on decade old substantial evidence, taps and financial records

the recipe you describe int he bug, and the recipe you refer to in 2478 ae two different things
the record must be unique, not the text
the record was dropped
the recorder player is stoned
the red Bic felt tip
the red bar wants me to re enter my pin
the red bars are *only* on pages we did anyhoo
the red isn't printing, even in grey
the red light is on on dubplate's cd burner  is it ok to open it?
the reflection interface can't help you there, because at runtime you can only get the data type, not the variable type.  So you end up with subtly different method dispatch, which breeds bugs
the refresh is much quicker now
the regenerate indexes bit?
the regent one was shite tho man
the regexp he recognized on is configurable
the regexp method seemed ok for gordon
the regexp to an extra-efficient state machine).
the regexp won't filter that out.
the register commentary on Steve Ballmer'
the register contains the address of the string
the register doesnt care though so it can just think 50521
the register has a fake OReilly t-shirt collection
the register never contains a value greater than 52
the regression tests didn't catch it becuase it's only int eh context of an authorized method being invoked that this happens
the regression was in package :wco-tests, not :wco-framework-tests
the relatively static data dictionary is gone, time values are highly processed, case statements proliferate
the release date of 2.0.10 simply depends on some bugfixing and testing
the release notes are on *some* kinda shape now...
the release notes say no java for linux
the relevant files are mostly test*.* for the two components,
the relevant fixes are:
the relevant ufl bit is in the scu appendix
the remainder or full day delivery issues
the remainder?
the remaining bit would be tracking of historical info
the remaining issues with migration are either sovled, or SAIC specific.  I will need to mvoe to SAIC dataset to close them out
the remedy is this: Make sure there's sufficient time between when the previous checkout or reservation is being returned, and when the current reservation is being picked up.  Or, make sure there's sufficient time between then the current checkout is being returned and when the next, already created reservation is being picked up.
the remote ftp client has nothing to do with it
the remove function is so not working
the removed things, that is
the rename thing?
the renderer does do calculations for stuff like tables or whatever but i don't think it can see framesets
the renew button disappears when you are out of the grace period
the renew stuff we can get nailed down on Monday I'm sure
the rent is slightly below market for the area, but they're good tenants and i want them to stay
the reosurce alias shit
the repair screen needs some GUI love-n-tenderness too, it's rather ugly
the repeated reservations will already exist
the repeater-entry-table, which was separate, is merged with that
the repeats are conflicting with themselves
the rephlex tour also had the same problem, they had to cancel all their canadian dates
the repl changes on top of this ar ea bit frustrating right now, we should getthose nailed first
the repl is fighting me
the replace part was a joke, I had no idea what you were refering to as the moro-viroli overthruster 8)
the report came in deviated, for sure
the report can be implemented without that feature...
the reporter was just superimposed onto a computer monitor as if she was walking on the rim of the CRT
the reports to support that are only in 2.1

the reservatino should not be in error, but rather frobbed before the rsrc goes offline
the reservation
the reservation and checkout status of all the resources in the checkout
the reservation can't be picked up if it has one removed rsrc, and one not removed
the reservation disappars
the reservation edit bug affects everybody
the reservation in question is now a returned checkout
the reservation is fully in the future
the reservation is probably A reservation is a committment from a patron to make a checkout at a future time.  Like a checkout, a reservation consists of a set of resources.
the reservation isn'tuntil the next day
the reservation was made a month before the checkout
the reserve by type thing is it
the reserve-by-rtype thing?
the resevation must be cancelled
the resizing was evil
the resolver code may be busted, since he apparnely just merged some in
the reson wcof-destroy alloc uses ec-delete is because I was looking at the first solution then
the resource IDs are red in the contents listing in the upper right
the resource allocation framework presently called WCOF
the resource doesn't really get deleted 
the resource id will be different even if two resources are broken
the resource import documentation is off, for sure
the resource is available 
the resource is displayed in the schedulator, in the selected
the resource is now available for checkout.
the resource may have been deleted tho
the resource records are there.
the resource rules match the revents and quantities
the resource selector has some pretty deep issues
the resource type instead of the resource id
the resource type situation on usc.webcheckout.net is a mystery to me how it occurred
the resource-types views
the resources are back in circulation at that point, so no worries for taking offline
the resources are imported
the resources are marked as returned but the usage fees are still accruing
the resources aren't auto-circ or anything are they?
the resources have return times, not the alloc
the response time on those barcode scans
the ressched allocations are so thin on data that we don't meet the minimum importability requirements
the rest are just boogs
the rest are just files
the rest are their issues
the rest comes naturally
the rest depends on the fam schedule
the rest for for-testers will be moved eventually
the rest is OK
the rest is all gui stuff and find-forms
the rest is for sysadmins
the rest is gravy
the rest is mediocre
the rest is pretty std NDA
the rest of it is enhancement requests
the rest of it is pretty cool but more as an example of using fractals to write music rather than soemthing to tap the toes to
the rest of it, and some of the semantics, are unclear
the rest of the UI stuff can be handled prior to that I believe
the rest of the systme is using local-time for such dates
the rest of the world operates at the system and module level, we can actually enforce the proper evaluation at that level
the rest of them were LA rockers
the rest seem ok
the rest seem quite minor.  I'm stoked!
the rest were incrementals
the rest you can feel but it doesn't hurt
the restore did complete though
the restore instance thing is biting my ass again
the restore on umich took about 30 minutes, and about 4 hours on alpha
the result is fiding myself with 86 buf between now and the 16th
the result is that I have to take 4 advils to be able to sleep
the result is that I havve a ton of messages sitting the in queue that were never sent
the result is that NATO is building a powder keg that is going to blow up even worse that before
the result is that anyone who uses pacbell cannot post to the guile list for instance
the result is that if I ask for a circulation-policy with PATRON-CLASS as :employee or whatever, I get NIL
the result of a migration of a rsource_log even for a resource that was deleted from the DB
the result of it that is
the result sounds wrong
the result was that only packet TO prep went thru the firewall, which the shithead NAT stuff won't handle
the results are promissing
the results are quite erratic
the results?
the resume is the most likely lie spot anyway
the return time is not stored
the return-time, used to compute fee, is determined by when it's scanned back in?
the reverb on that kick drum is mind boggling

the royal puzzle
the rpboelm is that when it errors out from something else it then bombs on that
the rpn query feels like it is nearly abstracted out of webco.  I didnt want to block any attempts to generalize it for inclusion in odcl
the rpoblem is that I can't reproduce the destruction, not with fixed, or broken psoft
the rsrc import documentation is incorrect, I have some changes there
the rst of the bugs remain open until we get the popup list and multiple text field widgets going
the rtype has a max checkout length of 5 hours.
the rtype hierarchy is global
the rtype index is a bit different now, and can e rebuilt easily enough
the rtypes are missing on wave.concordia.ca

the same applies here..
the same as the server, as I'm on alpha
the same as you
the same assertion can be added to the set-property form for name
the same avl tree
the same ay we do now in .cmucl-init.lisp
the same day
the same docs are used for support.webcheckout.net etc
the same for
the same function it uses to update the index for each facet property could be used in the property reader or writer to update just that specific index
the same name as one of the specified generic functions, that function becomes the method function of the default method for the new generic function of that name. 
the same problem would produce bad data in the cache, I flush the whole cache after I twiddle the DB
the same query run today returns fine, but ti crashe alpha all day yesterday
the same reason i'm going to ping out momentarily
the same thing at that
the same thing you said before
the sample in the homework used 24 => 50 52 0    for a null terminated string 24

the scary thing is people actually fall for that over and over
the scenario is that I need a way to see full data... beaCue I get matches on the 2ndary titles for instance which don't show up in the simple view
the schedulator doesn't allow pickup > return time if there are rsrcs selected
the schedulator ends at October 25 2001
the schedulator fuckup means he doesn't have a schedule set for his checkout center
the schedulator is a moral outrage
the schedulator tells me it is 559:30
the schedule i am seeing in my crapplet is not the schedule i specified on the location-detail screen
the schedule-node cache
the scheduler cache would never grow
the scheduler is basically unusable at this point...
the scheduler is my bitch
the scheduler should catch the single checkout constraint
the schedules for allocations and resources don't really do that
the schedules for location-regimes do, and it's a walking disaster

the second have of boog 3997.  I cant find where it lives
the second he brings home the first little fucking tinfoil package
the second is ok
the second is that we add delete-instance, which operates along with make-instance to complete a non framework specific object lifecycle protocol, and it handles EC manipulations if needed
the second live one
the second one is doable
the second one is sorta like Joy Division, or Cure, it's sparse and empty, and meloncholy
the second one just didn't have the raid configured in the bios
the second option assumes that the g3 is indeed the problem, something I'm not totally convinced of yet
the second pair is live down there
the second part is a config file problem
the second part of that value list, the whole matched field
the second part would be either a postgresql specific statement using execute-command, or some sql compliant mechanism for doing that
the second says use wcof-allocation-link to display wcof::allocation-links as HTML -- but what is an allocation-link?
the second statistician takes a shot and misses, just below the duck

the second value is ignored
the second would lead to chaos if those instances somehow filtered into the app

the testing version doesn't compile init
the testing version's release notes should be kept separate until it is released, at which point they become the topmost entry in the cumulative release notes 
the tests are already helping but there's not enough of them
the tests fdont build the db
the tests were failing because two tests using string= strings were being compiled such that they were the same string instance.
the teut-o-meter on the server went nuts and they reined it in
the text is done-ish
the text on the prelogin home page mysteriously disappeared again
the that should nail all UCB bugs
the the dj phenom is going to collapse
the the dj phenom?
the theater exampel really is a set e.g., delivery
the theater example is not very good
the theatre I saw Laurie Anderson in last night would have been a blast
the theory is that folks can run the framework tests before integrating framework changes and make sure no additional tests fail
the there is another change he proposed to the way ECs work which will get rid of all the cache resizing shit
the thing I see is the cmucl is configured, but not cmucl-small
the thing I'm worried about with RH pkg is the RH equivalent of debconf...
the thing eric talked about...
the thing for us is that since you rarely instantiate all of an RDF entity when operating on it those costs do not manifest too often.  Groves are not like that, as least not in my understanding.
the thing i like about toto is that they wrote two of the greatest songs of the 80's but everything else they did is simply awful
the thing is I can't test printing from here
the thing is I gotta get rid of the current sofa
the thing is I wanna go back to italy in the fall sometime...
the thing is MC is that those users are not employed by the MC
the thing is i can't get the override to display on the screen unless the next-state is :pickup
the thing is if the listener fires the sap integration or whatever it's doing now, you end up with the app does for 5-10 minutes when it could be moments
the thing is if you want to display it in the Checkout contents or scheduler, you have to do away with the resource type name
the thing is it depends on how clueless the person who did the initial import-file was
the thing is it don't matter much
the thing is it is 10 minutes until 5
the thing is it's deadend code 
the thing is just how likely the policies will be the same for other checkout centers, and whether you wanna manage them as one or not
the thing is offline right?
the thing is over 68,000 pages long
the thing is resource-types are schedulable now, so you can conceivably add one to your checkout
the thing is supposed to be idempotent after all
the thing is that ec-abort is called in contexts where we may not be actually attached to a transaction
the thing is that it's station and not printing.lisp that changed
the thing is that my objection is based on a notion of security
the thing is that that variable is defvarr'ed to jesse which is a valid database on the system
the thing is that we doctored the data to put all the stuff in one location and one organization
the thing is that would require changing how multiples of a resource are displayed
the thing is that you have to pass select-elements a simple node list
the thing is there is a new patch 
the thing is, I don't think there is problem with the pkgs
the thing is, dpeending upon the textual construction of the code is non-lispy
the thing is, every string ever coming from the DB is going to be like that
the thing is, we never made circ policies without a patron-class, it alway defaulted to :other
the thing is...
the thing just barely even does what it claims to
the thing seems definately to be in not bad shape
the thing that happened just now
the thing that is making the inventory report so slow is doing separate metadata lookups for each displayed property of each resource
the thing that troubles me most though is how much webcheckout sucks
the thing to do is simply turn on sql tracing, I think
the thing to remember is that editing passes are good but what's really needed is a continuous process
the thing traverses ssh auth keys .. look in auth.log on prep at 'May 12:04:0' for an example
the thing we're fighting against is IT inertia -- they're used to ftp'ing files around
the thing which fucks us is that we cannot seem to hash out design issues in a civilized manner
the thing which should solve JHU's naming issues for root types
the thing with potato also is that they are no longer shipping security fixes for it
the thing?
the things I do....................
the things i do for love 
the things in your init.lisp are useful to the whole group, so it would
the things is we're not sure if it's still problem in the head
the things to look for are: parent types being properly set for rtypes, and authorizations being properly migrated and reflected in the applet
the things you mentioned are all derivative of that
the thinkpad is very geek
the third floor *is* the smoking floor
the third ojection applies to permanent leases too
the third statistician jumps up and shouts GOT HIM!
the thirds was the usage fee
the thong is cool, too
the thought of it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside
the thought of production system with problems rattled us dutr 8)
the thoughtless cocoa fortification
the thread err is gone, but i couldn't tell what was causing it
the threat of Turkey or Iran invading is no reason not to call for the USuk to get out of Iraq tho
the ticker config script cranks up a new netscape window when you try to return to lindonline
the ticket part doesn't matter
the tickmarks?
the tide changed in my eternal battle against entropy!
the time could be configured, but its gonna be a low priority unless someone ponies up dough for it
the time for data issues is long past...
the time is out of joint
the time just seems to be sliding around
the time's ok for me
the time-sync alone, I'm pretty sure, will never ever crash it
the timeline changes quite a bit in 2.0
the timeline is now alternating shades of titlebar blue
the timeline is properly colored now
the timeout was changed
the times are basically irrelevant
the times are no longer off an hour, I can editing regimes and name them too
the times were inserted without offsets
the timesheet
the timesheet users list
the timezone offset must be applied in the wrong direction i guess
the timing doesn't make that much sense: 10:30-noon, 2pm - 3:30 -- that gives 30 mins in morning, 1hr in around lunch assuming 1 hrs lunch, and maybe 3 hours near end of day...
the timing element is a big thing.
the tinderbox is not within the table anymore
the tinderbox, it is annoying me
the tinderboxen should be back in action now, boris is slow
the titanium just says trophy wife
the title bit, not the url bit which is what i'm working on 
the title term for the search actually indexes alot of other fields
the title thing would require a media reload
the titty bar stuff isn't even on that often
the tizzy is going to come when we have to push aside other features to implement that one
the to field is all screwy
the toaster
the toolkit from which the work is built is called ramen
the top hat really brings it home
the top is a reflector
the top level of the package has a pkginfo and pkgmap file, and a reloc directory
the toplevel types thing I think craig mentioned he fixt
the total doesn't show it but there is a link to the invoice containing the usage fee
the total number of objects it has to collect from the db, externalize and download to the crapplet
the total number of patrons who made allocations
the total number of resources used
the total numbers of resources a checkout can have
the totalizing kind
the tour manager worked overtime to get me in too
the towtruck driver showed up and left
the tpdr and the param tags
the trace didn't help eh?
the trace documentation says about the :wherein argument:
the trace doesnt seem to match up with the source
the track on Aquemeni with the horn sample that you know
the track, as I recall, is Emergency Broadcast
the traditional greeting could be dude, where did you get that jacket?
the transactio stuff to handle this WAS in tehre before, but it got taken out
the transaction subsystem hooks into it, as well as the indexes
the transfer from wherever it comes from can get interrupted
the transition is in the allocation
the transonder said to the console
the transponder is throwing it out
the travelling webcheckout lion tamer
the treatise
the treatment of them in the tasks report is that they in some way are involved in the set or strike
the tree can be very deep
the tree is a representation of a view of part of the scheduling heap
the tree is generated differently each time
the tree really enforces what we have been doing all along
the tree?
the trees are ensuring the integrity
the tribe, the village, the free city, the state -- then death

the trick by the way
the trick is to get cgi and html to run out of the same directory
the trick to partitioning the data is thus:
the trick:
the tricky bit is i have a gig on monday night
the tricky bit?
the trigger slot worked fine for me
the trigger word of h1story is too common

the tumor on my ulcer is getting a hemmorrhoid
the turkey-salsa stuff.
the turnover rate is insane there
the turqoise part is the worrisome bit
the turtles or whatever
the tutorial does
the two are: f-p-f, and the results browser, which gets its contents from the f-p-f
the two big breakers have not
the two bikers, Fatso and Baldy are hilarious
the two complaints I just had are valid man
the two screens are 90% the same but not 100%
the two sections of the admin manual you've improved are the chapter on odbc and the chapter on hw and sw requirements, correct?
the type names in the index are not aligned right, I'll fix it
the type of its first param is bool
the type systems are much different too.  I have much more limited types available to me.
the type thing
the typed closure
the tz issue?
the u of c mind control satellite made me do it
the ucb instance is _almost_ finished restoring
the ucb instance is set up with usb data
the uchi is pretty good though
the uchicago webcheckout it installs and spreads out
the ui has been available on prep 4 ever
the ultimate determinant is artistic limitations on the track
the umich bugs rather than proposed ehn
the umich downage is caused by fucky RAID controller
the umich requirment is that the allocation summary on find-allocations have each resource on its own line
the umich server has been down for days
the umlauts were specially imported 
the unabomber signed his letters 
the uncancelable, I call it
the undead snaus is ready to sip
the underlying bug has been fixed for months
the underlying machinery will use the get-authorization-rules method, which doesn't exist
the underlying problems is that all interaction is serialized and handled one by one
the unencoded value is not worth evalling
the unescaped parens will terminate postscript strings
the uneven economic recovery
the uni jobs here are harder to get than I expected
the uniq check then just has to check one value
the unit of currecny is the nickeleto
the unix system
the unknown error that didn't get saved was a 500 caused by me going C-c C-c in the middle of the return
the unstable cmucl packages depend only on libc6 2.2.2
the unstable deb is broken
the update-to-head etc... script need to be updated to backup FS data I think
the updates is 
the upgrade
the upgrade aftermath begins
the upgrade i mean
the upgrade script already creates a backup prior to upgrade
the upgrades?
the upper echelon of onShore will consolidate their powerbase in the upper reaches of the 1407 fortress
the ups man will come for me today with an item
the ups tracking webapp should have a GPS tracker that shows you the current location of the truck.
the upshot is not a black box for objects, but a squishy box, basically -- capability to control how the object system actually works, rather than just filling in slots and having big hairy inheritance trees
the upshot is probably not a black box for objects, but a squishy box, basically -- capability to control how the object system actually works, rather than just filling in slots and having big hairy inheritance trees
the upshot is that noone is paying attention to the media shit until 1.8 is done
the upside being we have a spare 512MB chip to shove into Prep
the upstairs mac works
the uri mook
the url
the url is 207.229.160.189
the url is where you get the file to import
the url you gave me
the usage fee thing is just one aspect
the usage fees .. I know nothing
the usage lilmitation one is not
the usc test instance is not required to be up all the time or anything
the use of hard-coded names is dangerous
the use of testing 3.0 would be if there is a slight different config on one...
the use of the term Gross makes me think that it's 3 times
the use-em-or-lose-em date
the user acction was the same, i didn't go deep enough into the trace
the user could still manually recharge the invoice, I suppose
the user doesn't know that's a trivial problem
the user is able to define fixed increment charges,
the user is going to have to perform an action of *some* kind to see the next set of reservations, so I guess taking them to a populated Find screen is worth considering.
the user just sees that they added a resource type and it doesnt appear in the circulator
the user manual?
the user of the framework?
the userid that runs wco for artcenter will need read access to the file they drop, and write access to the directory
the username.
the users are all over full patron allocation history.
the users are crying out for help with printing
the users dig it
the users have no need whatsoever for a WebCheckout location or organization, and it only causes trouble when they get confused 
the usglobe url above
the usql patch happened after 2.0.9.2 upgrade
the usual place?
the utexas config file likely has bugs, that is what I am saying
the utexas stuff is committed right?

the version number milestones are really for development targets, not system maintenance
the version of gen_billing.pl is not up to date at all in cvs
the version of the whole blasted kit and kabootle was out of date
the version tripping over that ticket-detail shit
the version we just finished last cycle was the first production system, and it went into poduction a few months ago.  Prolly has several million images in it by now.
the versions on the same between the two versions

the very idea of iterative development should be anathema
the vibrato on sponge seals it
the video for that song is one of my favorites EVER
the video for which featured them rubbing noses while singing and dancing in baggy clothing
the view avail thing is probably the same

the warning coems from USQL's transaction abort func
the warning isn't enough.  it has start and end points
the warnings are all substantive indicators
the warnings?  yes
the warp crash
the warp.lisp change is not necessary ?
the watermellon, though they call attention to that
the way I figure dthe hours is mostly in nights of hacking, where each night is 5 hours
the way I see it is that the topmost layer that understands how the data needs to be structured should do the check
the way Ihave it obviously 8)
the way craig had it was wrong because it was based on whether the compiler supports c-l-c, which is neither here nor there
the way defmarc and it's brethren works is prety nice actually
the way editing-context marshalls transactions
the way i always see it done is newest changes at the top
the way i see it is we need to do whatever needs to happen to make webco development easy for us
the way i see it... if they have such high expectations of their software maybe they should try writing their own
the way i was talking about is to have user click add button, it goes to add-to.pl, which adds it to the file and then immediately reloads the original page
the way it integrates with the inheritance system is really nice
the way it is now it says: 
the way it works is right, though
the way it works is that cvs actually connects using ssh
the way it works is that the current alloc, if any, is a new alloc, or one that is presently being edited
the way it works is that you connectto any of the hosts in a gnutellanet
the way it works now there is a explicit line in roots crontab calling the backup-data-cronjob script
the way the client wants to work resuaht-rules is not via roles
the way the code works now, it's printing the Authorized icon even if the type does not require authorization at all
the way they were eating?
the way to check would to look in wcof-entity and see if it has a look at *db-indexing-mode* or some other conditional around the index-clera call
the way to get the requirement you want is thru ensuring at that level of granularity, the system and module level, we have expected order of evaluation
the way to make sure it works is to get proper test coverage, and I already instructed him on that and filed bugs
the way we work, and it has served us well so far, is more like building up the house around you, not conceiving of a community and having an aesthetic model at that level
the way you handle the stylesheet is differently
the way your email comes up for me is really hideous
the ways of the ancients are lost to us
the wco patching is a given anyway, unless we want to provide multiple tunnels qualified by ip on remote system
the wco-log == deletable
the wco-restore call chain catches those errors and throws the data in a reject file
the wco_branch_2_0_merged tag i mean
the wco_relaese_1_8_1 tag is on the files
the wcodemo db wasn't recreated
the wcof-destroy boog?
the we here is you and don right?

the web :: the web
the web archive was the one i meant
the web blows
the web it checks out
the web manifestation of polish mohership even!
the web page is just Bugzilla
the web search will ask the question which pkg int he whole damn archive contains this or that file
the web?
the webcheckout checkout center is a little different, since it might e legitimately used

the whole DSL problem was because she had unplugged the extension
the whole app was just compiled clean
the whole approach to data integrity is so damn problematic
the whole chapter is titled Populating Data by Hand
the whole cinapps integration is kludgey
the whole circ-policy->patron-class->location triumverate gets pretty confusing
the whole city, with all the hippies in it?
the whole company?
the whole contract is worth $5000 if he pops?
the whole defun
the whole dependance on plpgsql is broken IMHO
the whole division-damen-western area has gone crazy in the last six months
the whole double agent thing is over
the whole framework seems like it is changable is all
the whole god damned thing
the whole handling of resource status is kind of broken, craig says we might backport from head to branch
the whole issue with tasks or jobs vs allocations on that reports mostly concerns strikes, which are not well supported in the current report
the whole laptop is less than an inch thick
the whole machine
the whole mag is written like that
the whole markets gone to shit
the whole ninja?
the whole of Nigeria
the whole ordeal will become a cherished anecdote you can share with friends and loved ones for years to come
the whole package export thing?  Not sure how to go about that.
the whole point of a renewal is that you start the clock over
the whole point of that function was to work outside the framework because the framework was breaking itself
the whole problem domain is full of propietary dorks
the whole problem with the test suite, too, btw, is that the db config for the integration needs to be stuffed in somehow for automated testing
the whole reason locations are resources is because they can circulate, be repaired and stuff
the whole recharge patron setting
the whole scenario here is a customer, never seen the app before, getting enough data in there to start
the whole search screen is 120 lines
the whole season was setup
the whole shebang
the whole song is about going to gay clubs lookin' for trade, you know
the whole system went down?
the whole thing is depndent upon the type of DB
the whole thing is fucked badly
the whole thing is probably pretty sane
the whole thing should be shipped running at max safety though
the whole thing should turn magenta or something
the whole thing was a sucky mess
the whole thing?
the whole top level interaction changed
the whole tz thing?
the whole umich approach to emailing is a bit different, you know

the word is hare-brained, fyi
the word is not important, the feature is
the word is yes, do a quicky mock up of all those lovely links in the  manner described; no need to make it real purdy, but just some kind of a thing
the word is: tests passing, interface needs some work
the word list says it all
the word they used was hazmat
the work around is to look at the small print, a resource will say it is reserved on another CK in the contents list so it is not a big issue
the work should be done now
the workaround is probably not all that palatable
the workaround is to not use our application for reservations and stuff

this one is a few months old
this one is a work of art
this one is a. being selective about what it spits out
this one is making me cry
this one is more promising
this one is my account
this one is shitting the bed even worse than the last one.
this one picks an object, picks a property, smells the required type, picks something of the required type or nil, and set s it
this one pretty silly 
this one sounds like steely dan meets kenny g
this one time, at yodel camp...
this one will be more focused
this one you better write tests for, ok??
this one?
this only came in last night
this oracle install has failed
this other func I just factored out now.
this overlapping thing is the bad one...
this part time job at the lab school
this past 24 hours has been very homo for me
this patch fixes it:
this person plays two roles, each with different sets of permissions
this pleases me
this poor box is so out o date
this poor guy I was talking two was maintaining this bizarre distributed obj and objc thingie, 3.2 and 4.2 I think
this portland connection is slooooow
this presario has serverd me well, but I need somethign that has a higher ram table
this problem is the result of findin an allocation without corresponding revents
this problem isn't a problem in the source though, aside from the lack of editing contexts to roll back transactions
this process blows
this profile stuff is the most organised code i've written 
this program i dumb .. why was i working hard all morning 
this program is pretty neat tho --- algorithmic composition, dsp, midi'd out the wazoo
this program will stream video too eventually
this project has suddenly gotten like all interesting and shit
this pumpkin bread rocks
this punning is getting to be a boar
this puppy is selling like hot cakes
this quarter she saw the worst she has ever seen
this question make sense?
this queue stuff sucks
this rain is riving me batty
this ram thing is going to be tricky
this recursion business is freaking me out with the simplicity and complexity of it
this report is icky
this reset button bites
this resource-summary change -- I should file that right?
this roodypoop T1 has gotta go
this routine is uri_to_insecure_url, not uri_to_secure_url
this rube goldberg stuff has gone on long enough
this saic plan issue takes all priorities
this saic printer is huge...
this saic stuff is billable too, right?
this saturday!
this says you need mucho ram for PG7.1
this schedule stuff is phenominaly obtuse
this script would exit after 24 hours
this season it's a barrel and sackcloth
this seems like a decent proposal
this seems like a problem with my computer
this seems like a race condition to me
this seems odd to me
this seems overcomplex
this seems redundant, what is intended?
this seems to be the minimum info needed to do a good interface.
this seems wrong in woody mod_webapp linking:
this sentence is not in e prime.
this sentence was typed using two keyboards simultaneously, one for each hand.
this server room is noisy!
this session brought to you live by debian BitchX
this set needs Paint a Vulgar Picture
this setq shit is bugging me
this shell acct is strange...
this shit is bomb fast
this shit is pathetic, don't even have a fucking debugging environment on the platform 40%+ of the webservers on the planet doing e-commerce use
this shit is trickie trickie
this shit needs to be worked out PRONTO,or we'll miss our deadline by two months
this shit rox
this shit'z broke
this shit?
this should all get written down in location.lisp so we don't have to keep sherlocking it out
this should be good
this should be our tech support hold music
this should go under either bill or kathleen... it's just maint of a crazy crazy web site
this should help with general 2.1 testing, I'm thinking
this should not be happening
this should only take about 30 minutes or so
this show is too good
this si that one that sounds like Vangelis's bladerunner soundtrack
this solvent shit is getting to me
this son always invades my mind when I open it
this song is a reflection of the turmoil of being a woman trapped in a man's body trapped in a living room with a modular synthesizer trapped inside it
this song is best for the title 'Beat My Guest'
this song is easy listening
this song is idiotic
this song is like incapacitance covering when the levee breaks
this song is soo cool
this song is spooooooooky
this song is the reason i listen to the rest of the disc
this song just sounds wrong without Blue Monday under it
this song that is playing 
this song was quite exciting to see done live
this song, blue monday and everyday is halloween are all the same song
this sort of thing's cropped up before, and it has always been attributable to human error
this sound familier, have we seen this before?
this sound program i got ... it's kind of top secret or something
this soundcard clearly blows
this sounds like sysadmin...
this sparc is going to spoil me
this statement amuses me greatly
this station is great!
this stubborn literalist is in hte middle of indexing...
this stuff is funny, but its making it vary hard to think
this stuff is so opaque to me, I don't know
this stuff is so silly
this stuff is trivial to fix
this stuffy nose and head sucks!
this stupid building is too expensive
this sucker is compiling fast too
this sucks
this sucks, I have to order a pizza cause I can't leave the house, cause if I do that is right when the DSL fucks come
this sucks, I've not had a hangover like this before
this sucks, no test coverage of index stuff at all
this sucks, we gotta get 2.0.10 out
this summer sucks
this sunday
this sux
this sux. im returning it
this switching into and out of session thing is a pain in the boot
this tag needs to be fixed here
this takes too long
this teat for tat bust end!
this tells me there is desynchronization between the scheduler hashtables and the database 
this tells your shell process which ssh-agent daemon it will be
this testing system is elegantly abusive
this thing fits me well
this thing has a 128 bit dsp coprocessor, and soundjam is optimized for it
this thing is maxed out at 192 megs
this thing is release ready
this thing needs to be a) faster b) less fragile
this time Im making it perfect..
this time for real
this time he's really moving out there
this time i created resource types from the app and 
this time i did...before?
this time its resource-take-offline
this time period is critical
this time they were adding an rtype to an auth
this time we called before the appointment to find out
this too shall pass
this track bites 
this track here is sweet
this track is cracking me up!
this track is making the cleaning lady nervous
this ucb data is too spare to be a good test bed for mnigration
this ucb thing is worrying me...
this ucla dell box is a crotch rocket
this upgrade is going to be a bitch unless we have the pserver port open
this uri crap is blows
this usage report thing is nuts
this user id thing ... is that going to be an additional field in our DB as well as theirs?
this usql merge with this kevin guy seems overcomplicated to me
this version of bugzilla = sucking
this vi on this box remembers where you were last editing
this video = funny
this war is a fucking disgrace
this was a banner day for my boxen.
this was a break through
this was a couple weeks ago, on the news ... hopefully the kids saw the news before they started huffing
this was a deap EC bug
this was a package install
this was a pinless error brah
this was a test 
this was about 15 yrs ago
this was about 4:00 my time
this was adding a person to a big big group
this was all discussed ages ago
this was all handled in the transponder
this was an hour ago
this was another guy, apparently working on a free cdb thingie...
this was another night of drunken folly, viz halloween
this was as I understood it
this was before
this was before some commits
this was before you froze it
this was breaking UCB
this was done awhile ago
this was from you I think... is this patch valid or trash:
this was has Susan Serandon in it
this was just  a straight reservation
this was loading saic data...
this was old fogie shit
this was on 2.0.9 too wasn't it?
this was on newly migrated utah data, from 1.7.2
this was on their 3.0 testing instance, yes?
this was supposed to be their last
this was the 2.0.3->20.5
this was the off-spec feature that Eric said to go ahead and give them
this was the other syracuse bug
this was worse
this wasn't covered in Teach Yourself CGI Programming with Perl 5 in a Week 
this wasn't the generate-js-case ... if that's horked too please commit ti
this way
this way i can participate in the profound pleasure of multiple-value-bind :)
this way i get to do most of the hacking in lisp rather than java too :)
this way if you have something simple like u-texas, you don't have to define indexer.
this way we can avoid the silliness of rtypes with no available resources getting added to checkouts 
this way we have maximal preservation of information from the file, which makes it easier for the html coders, and we can compile it down into a series of calls to format
this way we've got room to go down.
this way you'll appeal to their paternal instincts
this way, like a customer can see if something is final, in a bank reckoning sense
this wco-snapshot crap is still kicing my ass
this weather sux
this webco thing is slowly but surely needing more and more scripting stuff.
this webmin stuff is going pretty good, should be ready for at least basic use today
this week I have to learn everythign there is to know about formal models of access control
this week for instance my customization backlog grew because of several mttgs

this week, anyhow
this week, no complaints
this weekend is mexidependence
this weekend is three days?
this while wearing a cute sailor hat
this whole ASP thing is a pain
this whole day sucked royally except for the part where i got my moog back 
this whole network thing sucks, it's completely halted development on 3.0 for 2 full days now
this whole play-by-play war coverage seems like a really weird strategy
this whole process is wrenching
this whole separate vs together crap on the policy is kinda wonky in itself
this whole thing is a joke
this will be a lesson
this will be good for me
this will be part of the price
this will be very cool
this will fix a set of bugs in the iris and mco and other imports
this will help with any language confusion to ensure that we are on the same screen
this will make all salesmen happy 
this will prevent supercilious monosyllables
this will probably require grachhus attention
this will require a bit of planning and concentration 
this will seriously help testing
this wireless rocks
this wireless thing is gonna spoil me
this woman needs to get her shit together
this won't hurt a bit
this work would have needed to be done even if we migrated in a totaly different fasion
this worked well using a combo of html & golive
this world is kind of crap!
this world needs more dancing
this worm shit is bringing in some easy cash
this would add to the hours slightly
this would be a paid enhancement?
this would be fine with me
this would be part of a function that takes a list and a scalar, returns 1 if scalar is a member of the list, 0 if not
this would have been a great art project
this would have been a no brainer if it weren't for the damn logical path stupidities
this would not be bad if I could concentrate, but I can't
this writing is wearing me down, I need to lie down for a bit
this year
this year will be the greatest. i prolly only invoiced 200 bux or so for chiyoko and i've paid well over 10,000... dude
this year's round of majestically sweeping, intraholiday layoffs

uhm, I'm staying here
uhm, I'm stumped here
uhm, I've checked it in dewd
uhm, SAIC admins are cramping my style, they have yet to get us the VPN software, and Joseph said he was doing that yesterday when I called him
uhm, actually it was not cache but DB transaction failure
uhm, actually josh, you are between them and sales 8)
uhm, adam, it appears Pearson thinks that property sheets are a bug
uhm, adam, make sure you clan those out now and then
uhm, are wcof-config edits preserved across upgrades?
uhm, as far as 1.8.4 -> 1.8.5 patches, uhm, it's prolly not worth much of anything
uhm, as far as I know
uhm, auto-circ is known busted in 1.8 dutr
uhm, auto-circulation 
uhm, because the error on the first will thru you out of the or
uhm, because they were two different things?
uhm, but you just asked them to send such things to users to discuss amongst themselves
uhm, can I work from home today?
uhm, check indentation of course
uhm, could not open java40.jar
uhm, cvs?
uhm, define alot?  2?
uhm, did type-of change on me 8)
uhm, did we move resource-status back to returning keywords?
uhm, do you mean alpha?
uhm, does webco-support go to all the customers?
uhm, don't have an answer for you on the commit side
uhm, don't think so
uhm, dude
uhm, dude!
uhm, dude, no
uhm, dude, you are so 0wn3d
uhm, dutr, it's generated by def-scheduler
uhm, errr
uhm, errrrrrrrr, I was just getting ready to go to bed
uhm, find by me
uhm, gremlins?
uhm, he left?
uhm, he would need to be on the same segment
uhm, he's working
uhm, hell no
uhm, here is theproblem:
uhm, hmmmmmmmm
uhm, how did I fail?
uhm, how do I unban ya
uhm, how should I handle those symlinks?
uhm, i is gonna fall down
uhm, ick
uhm, if it does, it's news to me since I wrote those parts way back when
uhm, is prep still hosting payed sites?
uhm, is that a video game ref?
uhm, is there someone with my IP hanging out o the LAN?
uhm, is your wco-tests loading wcof?
uhm, it appears to persist in some cases, I am tracking that down
uhm, it can't be man
uhm, it don't work that way 8)
uhm, it is not quaranteed idempotent
uhm, it is supposed to include repairs
uhm, it needs args
uhm, it seems to be looking in the wrong place for that lib
uhm, it will lock up their box for awhile
uhm, it's ILISP tho
uhm, it's a hard one
uhm, it's coffee time
uhm, it's depends on where the error is
uhm, it's hanging
uhm, it's not a module or a system, so no
uhm, it's not all that ready
uhm, it's tunneling X 8)
uhm, josh
uhm, josh, did you fix the find-resource with checkout center set to ANY bug?
uhm, just kidding
uhm, let me recall
uhm, maybe 15 minutes?
uhm, maybe tommorow?
uhm, messianic Grad student alert:
uhm, need a hand with java
uhm, need more info, not seeing it here
uhm, never mind
uhm, no
uhm, no  didn't disable it in CVS if I remember correctly
uhm, no idea
uhm, no it's a bug
uhm, no it's not
uhm, no lcue
uhm, no they won
uhm, no wcof-destroy
uhm, no you do them both
uhm, no, 1.8.8
uhm, no, I am not ignoring anything, the property layer should not be calling that if it is properly set, and it is NOT during demo load
uhm, no, I gotta take care of some other stuff around here
uhm, no, remember that I left right in front of you
uhm, no, that's not a real patch man
uhm, no. i can stop any time i want to...
uhm, no?
uhm, none.
uhm, nope
uhm, not I. 8)
uhm, not as bas as some of the others
uhm, not from me
uhm, not much opus
uhm, not really
uhm, not schedulator
uhm, not sure we pick the most used one presently
uhm, not sure what I can do with cpio files
uhm, not sure where strike date comes from?  Is that the end of the allocation?
uhm, not that long, no
uhm, not to show items with a status of :pending-delete
uhm, ok
uhm, ok regent start now 10:11 PM
uhm, ok, is 1.7.1 going right back on head or what?
uhm, only one rule change
uhm, orgs are significant still
uhm, pam, josh, it appears there still has been no announcement sent ot customers about the downtime this afternoon
uhm, perhaps it failed to survive the horrid CVS fuckage that occured yesterday
uhm, person-create excepts a store=property
uhm, poo
uhm, pooo
uhm, prolly don't want your password in there
uhm, recondiser wether you want to turn it on for everyone
uhm, regression suite I LOVE YOU!
uhm, so this means we need to be running 2.0 on the beta or any instance
uhm, so we are back on head?
uhm, sure, it should be able t fit in my pack
uhm, test that first tho of course 8)
uhm, that happened like late at night on the 1th, not tonite
uhm, that is a property-input method I beleive
uhm, that is not good
uhm, that is what eggplants are 
uhm, that leaves us fucked eh
uhm, that screws us tho, we need it for testing 8)
uhm, that sounds bad
uhm, that was just a space change
uhm, that would be better
uhm, that would be dumb
uhm, that would be huge
uhm, that would not be scalable to large productions
uhm, that's a new one to me
uhm, that's cause you don't got it configured right
uhm, that's kinda circular tho adam 8)
uhm, the only commit I had was from different files
uhm, there are only 29 records 8)
uhm, there is aproblem there tho
uhm, there is no let binding in my version of the code dutr
uhm, there needs to be some way of making it clear the hihest fee applies to all usages above it as well
uhm, they already bought it 8)
uhm, they are all assigned as far as I can see
uhm, they are just global vars
uhm, they define jackassedly but not lacanian
uhm, they didn't deny their existince, they listed them in their report
uhm, they were both unavailable resources
uhm, this is looking stupid
uhm, tumescent?  are you sure that is the word you want?
uhm, update webcheckout.lisp to get rid of annoying boog
uhm, we are actually 8)
uhm, we can just run it with older USQL
uhm, we prolly need a way to short-circuit email
uhm, weird
uhm, well you could do the checkout part by hand
uhm, well, if you runa  migrationr ight now, it will work,but be kinda slow
uhm, well, since we don't actually support unserialized as far as I know, might as well eh?
uhm, well, you can just run rtype-integrity-2 proll
uhm, what are the chances of getting gopher ssh upgraded>
uhm, what do you mean.  Can you do it in 1.8 or not
uhm, what if it was the wrong choice?  What are we to do now?
uhm, what is he issue with 5022 if any?
uhm, what is point of making resource indexed-storage?
uhm, what is that?
uhm, what is the currency package?  when did that get borned
uhm, what is up with the location schedule edit?
uhm, what tag adam?
uhm, what was my fault now?
uhm, what you mean josh?
uhm, what you mean?
uhm, where too now?
uhm, why is the default type for locations  DVD player ??
uhm, woah
uhm, worker-threads?
uhm, yes
uhm, you can *now* that i re-exported the key
uhm, you gotta match up the events of the interval tho
uhm, you missing
uhm, you prolly don't wanna do that lightly
uhm, you prolly have a problem there asking for the wrong slot
uhm. The only english book I read as a kid was Mr. Popper's Penguins

um, i'm going to come over there and slug you now
um, if I try to get by rtype and none are available, it just removes that
um, if each customer has a given set of say 5 biblio fields they want...
um, in preheat, I'm in trouble because .pdf can be generated two way -- via pdfjadetex or via jadetex->dvips->ps2pdf; I need to determine which one should be default .pdf, and give another suffix to the other

um, is ATI the right word, what am I thinking of
um, is it a var or a func ?

um, is this an imho issue or UI: General ?
um, is uc-berkeley instance itself running in uc-berkeely mode? the splash screen doesn't say
um, isnt' that why we established the support window?
um, it can't be that lame
um, it is unix isn't it?  BSD Unix
um, it should be case insensitive substring matching...
um, it works for me as documented
um, it's called httpd.conf
um, it's marked as assigned to you
um, it's not loading any schedules at all
um, it's on liquado not doze
um, it's returning the timesheet homepage... 
um, it's sticky taged

um, let see
um, let's see, risk management 101
um, lets leave it for now
um, lets not rush it
um, lets say all
um, lets say early summer
um, lets say, MARC biblio record, all in strict marc21 format
um, like, only 3 months after we requested they do that
um, maybe about a month, we did a proof of concept and they gave us a small data set
um, maybe just the ones we have to...
um, move it to production instance, just mention the patch they need
um, mum
um, needful maybe of chorizo pepper stew thing
um, no
um, no it's not even there yet
um, no that's not it
um, no wizards
um, no!
um, no, i don't think that's an apacheism... how could it be?
um, no, if you wanted generalized constraint handling anyhow it's a bit different
um, no, passes aren't written down yet
um, no, that's not requested
um, no, they show the actual ones that *do* apply in this instance
um, no.
um, no...
um, no... shouldn't be...
um, no?
um, nobody's talking!
um, not 1.6 for example
um, not PIR, sorry... rapid return
um, not so good
um, not sure
um, not that out of date
um, now to set?
um, object-properties on an rtype
um, of course?
um, of that type i mean
um, ok
um, ok, dude
um, ok, go on..
um, ok, so, putting this into alpha in 2 weeks and 1 day doesn't seem realistic to me
um, ok, wanna take over at this point on that box?
um, ok, well, we gotta give wheaton a walktrhu
um, ok, what are you doing with it?
um, okay.
um, on boris, my instructions are now accurate whereas they were not accurate before
um, on prep?  see passes.pgp 
um, opus should definitely not run as root
um, or was that a question?
um, pam already mailed it, no?
um, post i think
um, preheat doesn't need reconfiguring
um, prep wco instances i mean 
um, raw sql or not, thing changed betw pg6 and pg7
um, reservation end interval, I think, perhaps ought to apply to both checkouts and reservations, but however it works now is ok
um, right?
um, scratch that'
um, she is australian dutr
um, shite
um, should I commit this sort of thing:
um, should I file boog or boogs for broken screens?
um, since I didn't want to have to upgrade it later
um, so the changes you made today to odcl, according to our policy, are those supposed to have tests, and if not, why not?
um, so you're pretty much going to be tearing down demo.webcheckout.net as well?
um, so, it is wco-tests ?
um, sometimes
um, spacious 
um, squirrels are not kitties
um, starting saic instance actually
um, sure
um, tax stuff?
um, testing turn on
um, thanks
um, that guy that dances a lot, skinny guy
um, that would be Eric's fault :)
um, that's it actually :)
um, that's kinda messed up
um, that's not really what I mean
um, that's not the way to do it
um, that's not what I asked....
um, that's what an inline function is
um, the > 100 warnings including nasty 'make test' output is not critical?  or fixed?
um, the dell site?
um, the ref docs actually bold the $a or whatever...
um, the section on browsers
um, the warning Cannot check out [rsrc] for more than 0. is a little strange... 
um, their budget is like 8 hours, poor schlubs
um, there are a number of policies
um, there's a few
um, there's just one milestone ! 2.0!
um, they don't want to get wedgies from the jocks?
um, they have the wrong lpr pkg installed
um, they were visually appealing
um, this forces usql release...
um, through?
um, try SP_CHARSET_FIXED=YES instead ?
um, try another bug :)
um, tyring to get it to work...
um, um
um, um um
um, up today
um, using gnu objc or the next devel environ?
um, wait, I must not rule .. I only have $.67
um, we should set projected dates for when we're moving to the persistance system on *oracle*, too, I think
um, we're getting a dormer and a new roof
um, well yeah, i just counted the pages on the architecture
um, well, we gotta get off queso and put an irc server with a channel bot on gopher
um, well, you don't have to use the modem
um, what did I file...
um, what does barney use for a coffee table in his house
um, what does do it?
um, what is called thinking?
um, what language do they speak in the netherlands?  dutch right?
um, what replaced assert-id ?
um, what was our name for the users for the property sheet inteface
um, what's the rest of the number?
um, what?
um, whatsa question?
um, wheaton might find that vaguely satanic
um, when I sent the eamil that I was
um, when I upgrade the pkg, its going to re-run schema-migration
um, when you type dnsdomainname what do you get?
um, whenver you're making a chekcout, pickup time == now
um, where in projex?
um, where's mexico?
um, which fascism is that?
um, who all is doing it?
um, who made that decision?  and was it really wise?
um, why are yo uworking on 1.7.1 when 1.7 isn't out yet?
um, why not put it on a web server where i can download it at my convenience
um, wo ist?
um, yah
um, yah, 'man dpkg'
um, yeah
um, yeah, at some points, convincing
um, yes
um, yes, believe it might be 'Calendar Screenshot.jpg'
um, you are doing it backwards
um, you could remove emacs19
um, you guys do realize that umich doesn't allow editing of metadata from upstream, right?
um, you know how to redirect stderr and stdout don't you?
um, you mean 7.3 ?
um, you misunderstand
um, you should go staple a cvs man page to his fucking forehead
um, your explanation of the problem doesn't make sense
um,that is pretty low
um. ok.
um. what?
um..
um.. gimme 1 sec
um.. locate htdocs
um..!
um...
um... 
um...      ?
um... I don't think I ever stonewall people
um... I ferget.. going to rtype detail page I think
um... I think I pulled that box down to 2nd floor
um... I think he did.. they didn't like the color scheme, as we expected
um... I think she means the invoice on that checkout... it's wierd
um... I think so...
um... I'm not sure on that one
um... I'm uncertain whether it's reasonable or not
um... a bit...
um... and be behind a firewall :)
um... diplomatically speaking i'd say .... yes
um... do we have any other ether cards lying around?
um... dude... does it matter?  sometimes i saw 300kps, and that was wrong... so lets jsut say I saw peaks which flooded the T1, but never for more than 5 min
um... how does that answer the question:
um... hum... I'm starting to like this idea less and less
um... i'd have to look
um... interesting
um... it *is* inhibitting logging
um... it shouldn't...
um... lemme see..
um... let me look ... i forget how webcheckout works.
um... no one's talking about *using* it...
um... no, it's fine... 
um... no...
um... not exactly
um... should be harmless, sure
um... still not getting it...
um... task bar ? what is that?
um... that was the plan, it's ok
um... they are the same thing, kathleen
um... we were runnign the debian version before too
um... what now?
um... which 2 bugs
um... which estimator is which?
um...!
um....

um?
umhmm
umich
umich *must* be updated tonight.. I hope the head is pretty stable
umich == head though, right?
umich and utexas are production
umich blew up on demo load
umich box just disappeared off the interweb
umich bugs are pileing up
umich builds their own apache.
umich builds their own apache?
umich calls are bad for the bug count
umich complete may take several hours to run
umich could give a fuck to preserve the underlying marc infrastructure
umich data loaded
umich doesn't really need migration, but ucb does
umich event queue is alive and running, just doesn't have any patron-expiry events on it
umich folks... but they're not on the head
umich gonna be unhappy
umich has alot of beta
umich has been down since 10:36
umich hasn't been able to test all week
umich hasn't touched instance since june 7, hmm
umich import running
umich import still dies due to chars being passed back from indexers
umich inactive patrons problem, but waiting for return mail
umich instance last updated jan 7 ?
umich is 2.1?
umich is asking when to update instance
umich is back
umich is back up
umich is done
umich is gone
umich is gonna come down now
umich is not helping us

wcof error logs are much easier to read when filtered through tr -s ' '
wcof errors email today is under 1000 errors
wcof makes me think 'wimmen 'n chillen first' ... it needs help...
wcof ought to export 3 functions
wcof-config file, that's fine, nothing will break; but if they *do*,
wcof-config is never touched by autoconf
wcof-config isn't autoconficated...
wcof-config too.  Warning:  Declaring *WEBCHECKOUT-DATABASE-NAME* special.
wcof-config.lisp
wcof-config.lisp that is
wcof-create 'group
wcof-create group calls check-type, which drops you into the debugger, instead of throwing an error
wcof-delete is perhaps failing in the middle... you can trace it and see if it gets called
wcof-delete was wrong then, it was setting people :inactive, not :deleted
wcof-destroy for groups gotz boogz
wcof-destroy is never called
wcof-destroy method for the patron *should* throw an error in that case
wcof-destroy on framework session causes error
wcof-destroy won't let you delete if there are holdings
wcof-entity defines regenerate-all-member-indexes, which uses *DB-INDEXING-MODE* before the defvar in indexing.lisp has been seen
wcof-errors rocks
wcof-import-type is called by the fsdb reader IIRC
wcof-list and ordered-list are quite different from wcof-entity-reference and wcof-entity-reference-list
wcof-start-session
wcof-start-session timeout, horks interpreter
wcof-stop-session first I guess
wcof-stop-session please
wcof-test:demo does do cold-boot
wcof-tests package takes a loong time to compile
wcof-tests still failing
wcof-tests too bulky: chopping in half
wcof-tests::demo
wcof-tests::demo creates group video 101, adds 1 rtype, and 1 person, but person not authorized for rtype... i.e. checkbox is red
wcof-tests::demo is a pretty brutal test suite actually
wcof-tests::demo that is
wcof-tests::demo works on head now
wcof-undelete assumes status could be :deleted, but status can only be :active or :inactive
wcof-view-entity

well ... i gotta make sure i'm not fucking up the circulation screen by changing the class
well ... i haven't been using the linux one much tho

well hold on a second 8)
well hold on, it's already running the regression test right?
well hold-on
well honed flamer that user
well hooray for bug!
well hooty hoo 
well hopefully 2.0.9 will be done before my next install
well hopefully it'll produce a working linux monday
well hopefully that thread will lead to some discussion of the problem domain
well how about if there is a problem, someone tells me
well how about you report a good bug?
well how can it be a problem on this machine if gopher said it accepted it?
well how come i can create a person but not a resource
well how do you expect me to do anything when you aren't commited up
well how hard is it to apply the patch on say a debian 2.2 system?
well how long has it been running
well how much communication have we had with saic regarding this
well how on earth are they supposed to test
well how would he have gotten the film to the fotomat?
well howdy
well hurry hurry hurry
well i already ran setup.sh manually ... lets see if it happens again
well i also bet irctoons doesn't beep
well i always refer them to the docs
well i am just going to set *filedrops* to nil
well i asked if there was any possibility that somebody there set them all to zero, and he said he told people not to touch anything policy wise
well i assume it starts at 0
well i assume no news == good news for 1.6.3
well i assume that the ppp config from alpha will work from any modem right?
well i assume webco isn't targeted for linux anyhoo
well i believe there is an option for that
well i bet ours has more parentheses'
well i can connect from here
well i can definitely see all their repeated PIN attempts in the logs
well i can get it via http, so it must be fwall
well i can hear that too, but i'm so accustomed to it i don't even notice 
well i can reach www.bcm.tmc.edu
well i can safely reccommend the Chicago Chop House if you want a nice steak next time you're in town
well i can see why you wouldn't like wilco
well i can't break it
well i can't get network connection
well i can't reproduce 3818 on my box
well i can't reproduce this tech staff thing on prep
well i changed the summary line to reflect the fact that the bug is CLOSED 
well i checked the 2.0 integrity tests into wco-test
well i chose the 56K option for the download speed which restricts you to 32Kbps but i think it will handle 44.1Khz samplling rates
well i commented out the part where it tries to get the instance name from debconf and hit return a few times to get past the bits where i couldn't see the conf dialogs
well i could come by tomorrow too
well i could try to guess i suppose
well i couldn't break it yesterday
well i couldn't connect to gopher for a few minutes
well i created it months ago and now have to add
well i define that as clicking the commit button on the applet, then confirming on the pre-confirm page
well i did it by hand
well i did, didn't you see my other email?
well i didn't ask really
well i didn't even bother checking the debian customers since mod_ssl isn't on by default
well i didn't install teh pkg remember
well i didn't mention the stun guns
well i didn't really understand it, but I'm weak on help having never seen it
well i don't have to pay rent for another 3 weeks so do what you gotta do
well i don't know any of that, so thanks
well i don't think anyone can ever expect to depend only on framework tests
well i don't think it would be quite as easy as going bleep bleep bleep with the scanner
well i don't think it's a major emergency if it's not up tonight, as far as i know they are not in production, and they have a working testing instance at onshored
well i don't think it's that but it might be...
well i don't think its a big deal anyway...
well i don't want to speak for everybody else
well i done did that
well i dont want to make the testers spend more time explaining what they did than it takes to test
well i doubt he thinks there is anything wrong with it
well i doubt it's a big deal
well i doubt the os has anything to do with it
well i doubt you disagree with him
well i dunno about boot floppy but it was pretty simple to do with a .deb
well i dunno diddley about 2.1 codebase
well i dunno from 8BIT-BYTE-ARRAY-BINCH for surely
well i dunno if the search allocations by id field checks barcode too
well i dunno if they could be any more of a pain
well i dunno, some way to inspect the schedule tree i guess
well i emailed them
well i eradicated all those anonymous handleEvent methods
well i evaled the form
well i figured it wouldn't be a Bally's Total Spandex Workout Centre
well i finally got mac-on-linux running on the g4 today
well i fixed it on the branch
well i fixed it so it will just dump the database once a day to data-dump.sql but  if the database gets fucked up 2 days in a row, they are up shits creek
well i forgot to listen to matmos
well i found a workaround for that ilisp bug
well i found the list link so i got that
well i go eat, back in a bit
well i got me a 7 reel, which should probably last me until they're doing the String Theory Behind the Music in 2040
well i got some onshore work to finish I was just seeing if any of the folks were aroung so i'll be chatting with you layter....
well i got the same error
well i got these 3 xls thingies from pam
well i gotta dig out from under all these tech support issues first :P
well i gotta go downtown to cash a check
well i gotta say the applet handles a fuck-ov-a-lot better than it did yesterday
well i gotta tell them what i did to their box, then it's dan's problem
well i guess 1.8 is pretty stable with only 113 resource and 28 patrons
well i guess he wasn't really from that lineage
well i guess i better call penny and break the news...
well i guess i could on prep or strings
well i guess i just did 
well i guess i ought to close all of those blockers .. presumably no progress made on those?
well i guess i promoted a bunch of messages, so they all havve ! next to them
well i guess i won't be learning any new features today
well i guess it makes it real secure...
well i guess it's faster
well i guess it's not big enuff of a deal to warrant fixing 2.0.10
well i guess it's okay like that huh
well i guess most of our debian custs are using 2.2
well i guess resizing shmmax and shmall don't even require rebooting the server 
well i guess they can test it
well i guess we have to examine multiple instances to watch for patterns
well i guess we haven't paid monitronics
well i guess we just keep breaking it down into subtypes huh
well i guess you can drop in in there but then ... poof!
well i guess you have a point ...
well i had a buddy uploading some stuff for me  
well i had started investigating it before when it was on 2.0.9 so i wanted to continue with that while it was still fresh in my mind
well i had the timeline as a panel in a scrollpane, expecting to be able to draw the selector thumbs on top of the component, which turns out to be less than easy
well i have 30 mins before the call, it's worthwhile to look into the bug anyway
well i have a disease vector near me
well i have a patron who has NIL class
well i have a summer basement that smells like poo so there
well i have no idea if it has anything to do with webmin but it has never happened to me before
well i have the graham book which has a chapter on clos but i want more
well i have the patron userid but not the patron OID

well i haven't gotten approval from max saying YES they are ready to go vanguard production style
well i haven't tried to mound hda1

well i hope so
well i hope they do
well i hope they get him fixed up good
well i hope they got evacuated as much as possible
well i hope they went to jail
well i hope this burn worked
well i hope this doesn't break something elsewhere, where people are taking the car of the return value...
well i hope we bill the fuck out of them
well i hope whoever got my qp is a vegetarian and they sue 
well i hope you are proud of yourself
well i hope you pad their rent to cover it
well i installed it now i cant reach webcheckout
well i installed it on JHU
well i just don't wanna bitch at them for asking for all these reloads if they are paying extra...
well i just made myself some nutty nuggets yogurt and banana...top that mr....
well i just reloaded and got something
well i just sent the email
well i kinda came into some money
well i knew that one
well i know
well i know adam got that package installed on prep
well i know but you could cause other mischief
well i know it's abug
well i know sales just wants to fwd the old extensions to the new phones
well i know sigsegv
well i know that. i had to change them
well i know what i like :)
well i know you tell go live doc root and i think that absolute in go live means from doc root
well i let craigl talk me into letting him rewrite the print functions
well i like the idea of a totally separate UI for patron-initiated
well i like to VNC into it and it's easier to just type liquado.onshored.com instead of figuring out which devel4X it got mapped to
well i looked at the tables and it looks proper 
well i maintain any time a resource thinks it belongs to a resource type, and the resource type denies that the resource belongs to it, is a bug
well i mean ... it's like just something i've seen on teevee for me ... i know it really happened but the desensitization factor from watching bruckheimer films and stuff kind of numbs me to the significance
well i meant in comes back online date
well i meant it as a joke
well i missed sandra's call monday due to my voicemail forwarding fuckup
well i need a regexp that subtracts the web server address from the url
well i prefer to err on the side of caution 
well i put a note on 2880 but if you think it's a separate bug
well i put one in there but someone can look at it and see what they want to put there
well i put them in my homedir on peewee, somebody who knows should move 'em to the right place
well i ran it through the browser and it worked fine
well i said we'd try
well i saw the promo
well i should probably stop hogging jesse's homeputer
well i snuck into all the redhat servers and turned of modssl
well i sold a laptop
well i sort of do
well i still have to get the module organized and checked in so don't worry 'bout it yet
well i still use Thinkpad at worky
well i suppose it depends on which instance pam was testing
well i suppose we can announce it however we'd like
well i suppose we could go digging through all requests dealing with specific allocation X 
well i sure can't get this fucking thing working.  time to beat the rodent
well i sure didn't type that!
well i sure get that alot maybe should update the dagman?
well i sure wasn't going to talk to her for 8 hours :)
well i surely don't think that
well i tagged it frozen
well i think accd is either going to have to revise their network policies or else not use printing in webcheckout
well i think all the talk of lawsuits was mostly to scare me
well i think i have helped the team by finding broken shit and diagnosing it
well i think i know what is wrong with my cable modem
well i think i was just running too much stuff
well i think in the interest of getting the release out this month i'm going to hand it back to you
well i think it automatically installs a WebCheckout location and organization
well i think it's woth pursuing in the context of 18x anyway
well i think that would be up to cbl, my weekend is pretty much owned already
well i think there might be another bug in there somewhere
well i think there might be certain situations where breaking character might be permissible, like when you might get THROWN IN JAIL
well i think we can probably convince utexas and uiuc to allow daytime upgrades
well i think we could just go buy a copy and then show them the CD
well i thinkk those are probably seach screens
well i thought i had that fixed
well i thought wco_relase_1_8_6 was a sticky tag?
well i tried all combinations of wrong timezones and couldn't get it to reproduce
well i tried that but it couldn't connect to the damn server
well i updated wheaton but the ssh port forwarding is just refusing connection
well i used to be able to ssh in
well i usually expect a call from either mike davis or mary franco
well i want to double check upgrade on alpha
well i want to understand the nature of the bug since it's causing problems elsewheres
well i was hoping as a favor youd take pity on me
well i was just going to build mod_webapp
well i was just tailing the server logs
well i was looking at writing some more testies
well i was quite and a geek for most of my school life
well i was ripping off danzig when i was 19
well i wasn't sure if they wanted us locked out 
well i will lose interest in hauling the cam around before too long anyway
well i will write a test for it in a bit
well i wish all my talk led to something fruitful
well i wish i understood.... it's basically meaningless to me for the most part
well i wonder if it would have hurt their biz to let them keep it....i would think so
well i wonder if the code agrees
well i would hope if they had 10 people in the class, they would have 10 cameras 
well i would, but it kinda defeats the purpose of fetching the circulation policies if you can't see them 
well i'd be interested to try mod_lisp but i think we should probably hold off on that until 2.1 or something...
well i'd be more than willing to help with programming stuff too
well i'd do it all under a pseudonym
well i'd kick in $5 of my own cash for each tech support issue he handles
well i'd rather not have the metadata tables filled with null pickup-instructions for every reservatinos
well i'd really like to avoid 2.0.11
well i'll be ack on sunday but i require rest
well i'll be happy when we are reliably connected to the DSL, we have a working phone system with extensions and voicemail, ACCD is in place at 1407 with no service interruption, 3.0 is out,  and 3.1 is in testing 
well i'll be sure to file anything nasty i run into
well i'll be there
well i'll do that on beta
well i'll do the demo now
well i'll drag my feet on installations
well i'll email him and give him the skinny
well i'll file a bug on that, you seem to have a handle on it so i'll assign it to you
well i'll follow up my email and say it's not urgent
well i'll git it 
well i'll give it a shot, what say
well i'll go with you if your scared..
well i'll just concentrate on Man sentenced for monkeys in pants until then
well i'll just let you fix that one....
well i'll leave that bug closed them, josh when you have a chance can you reload the data and I will test again tomorrow
well i'll look again....you wouldn't be coming in just for that though I hope
well i'll probably be back around midnight or 1
well i'll rbing em 2 work
well i'll see it sometime i am sure
well i'll see you when i get in
well i'll take the blame
well i'll talk to kath tomorrow and see if i'm cleared for a little javy apprenticeship
well i'll tell her to call you for APOP password, ok>
well i'll tell them it's a mac
well i'll update beta first
well i'm a bit touchy about that for some reason
well i'm all for that
well i'm all gone from queso anyway
well i'm all in favor of a Mighty Steak
well i'm at a good spot to test that out i guess
well i'm curious if the reason they are able to commit so many conflicting reservations
well i'm gettin out
well i'm getting 6.x seconds per 100 records for a 4 day search scope
well i'm getting shitty performance
well i'm going to do more testing for the moment, i still feel nervous about releasing, remembering how premature we were on 1.6
well i'm going to leave the name Contact Note to keep SAIC happy
well i'm going to meet kathleen and jk for lunch too, so maybe they can help

well i'm into cock torture
well i'm just writing the func in place at evergreen 
well i'm not calling Exporter.pm directly
well i'm not opposing upgrading people to 1.8.1 but i do want to give it a day or so to see who else finds bgus
well i'm not saying we shoud block release
well i'm not sure
well i'm not sure how to auto-configure it ... i just activated it from the console
well i'm not sure what exactly went wrong
well i'm not sure which packages need to be different for 7.1 vs 7.2
well i'm not sure why its finding conflicts in the first place
well i'm not sure... 
well i'm on 1.8 anyway
well i'm out of here
well i'm out tomorrow if that has any bearing
well i'm pretty much done for today
well i'm reproducing it right now
well i'm running it on care
well i'm starving...
well i'm still stymied by why re-running configure has fucked my app
well i'm sure i can do it if i clean everything first
well i'm sure it's no Sops
well i'm sure it's the case
well i'm sure we insured it
well i'm testing it now!
well i'm tired of having to wear pants
well i'm trying to make sure that all instances of the lockbox admin application, that i'm working with are killed cause i keep getting an error when i try and run the application
well i'm up now
well i'm writing the function anyways for utah, and it won't hurt to put it in there 
well i've been plaing with all day - you know
well i've hardly left it alone
well i've written a very destructive event queue cleaner upper
well if 50% of city particulate pollution is road traffic, would we attribute 50% of the air pollution deaths to traffic?
well if I had ILISP I would fix it
well if MWWT is 2 hours, and sopranos is on at 8
well if anybody is using the t1 it just breaks up like hell
well if anything bad happens adam, I'll get it tonite, leave me an email
well if i can figure out how to get my pgp keyring into gpg keyring, i'm ok
well if i can get autechre to do a remix of string theory i'm going for it
well if i can't export it that's a fucking shame
well if i were you i wouldn't show up
well if it fails safe then there's no problem 
well if it lowers tech support call volume i guess i'm all for it anyway :)
well if it wasn't useful, i probably wouldn't have to fix so many production instances now would i
well if it works on the head and not on the branch i think maybe we should think about vanguarding lansing
well if it works, we can change it to exit 1
well if it's a config issue on their end, fire it back to them
well if it's not milestoned for 2.1 it doesn;t
well if it's the same version that we have binary of, then i don't see aproblem
well if its commercial they will give at least 1.5x a shit as if was mook dsl
well if pam comes back i'd rather have her do it i think, but otherwise i can do it
well if rollback fails we are in inconsistent state
well if she shows up, I'll be attempting to access room 504 if the carpet glue has died down
well if that's cool
well if the controlling terminal disappears during installation that's not really within the realm of the pkg maintainers responsibility IMHO
well if the return time has lapsed and it's still unexpired then it's a bug
well if the secret service ran the show he wouldn't have even been out there i bet
well if the uni want to treat me like that then fuck them really
well if there are no allocations with a missing OID, and no other record of that person in the DB, then either the DB got rolled back from a backup or something
well if there's no data changes between 1.6.1 and 1.6.2, why would you?
well if they've already been annotated once you just need to type same thing and close it out
well if we do have problems, i am betting they will be migration related, not appliction related
well if we don't comment it then we could upgrade from 1.8.2->1.8.4
well if worse comes to worse we can go up to guitar center and pick you up a $150 T-1200 knockoff
well if you can hear cyndi lauper, that's the right station
well if you consider that korean does't usually use english letters...
well if you do, don't be a hero and show up for work
well if you dont like scripting via golive then i hate it all the way
well if you get famous and decide to off yourselfd, make sure it'snot where I'm gonna find you
well if you have Lucent chipset Winmodem ...
well if you have a phrase in english like The car which has red tires and a funny plastic chicken on top it would translate to german as Der Automitrotenwheelundklukengetoppenhangen
well if you have different properties for the different subfields, how to you handle repeated fields?
well if you look at the changelog for projex...
well if you seal yourself off the network, it won't be much better
well if you want to give me a minute i am gonna zip up some graphics files so kat can do further changes and i'll ask her to sign off then
well if you want to i won't complain
well if you want to put them on the list to get it that is fine but I really need a sign off on rrt from them cause we have cashola waiting on it
well if you want to spin aliases it's all good too
well if you're controlling the width of the line itself, how can it be stretchy?
well if your taking van, sure, stop by
well ilisp works similiar to emas elisp interface
well im a cold wimp, theres a draft
well im annoyed fuck this later
well im goin to cali from 24-28
well im having a problem bottong off the hd
well im learning some stuff, even if it is the hard way
well im offf to eatsville
well im trying now. shouyld i just be able to connect directly to the mac now? Or should i go to queso first?
well in a sense i suppose it is
well in my case all i have to do is abort and try a new combination of random resources, patron and location
well in that context of the thread, it found none
well in the bid we stated one contact point for the zoo...
well in the interest of expediting the process i'd skip it this time since we aren't even positive it will run on rh8
well in the utopian society they would remove stairs and replace them with ramp
well in this case it's fully reaped in the DB just not the interface
well indexed-query wasn't returning nulls, just IDs that didn't map into biblios
well inspect *media-fieldsa-bibliographic* actually
well instead i think i will run home and brush and floss
well is my boss, it's always been the well
well is there one for everyone or one each
well isn't it pretty easy to fix?
well isn't that convenient
well isn't that part of the spec
well it apparently has some hcks for ora9
well it bloody well doesn't work either
well it busted
well it can be all of those:
well it certainly cleaned my tiles
well it certainly comes more often than you'd like...
well it changes
well it could be yet another include
well it depends on what the conditions on alpha were at the time
well it depends on what you do with it i think
well it depends on when you think we'll need to import patrons next
well it depends on which bit you check in actually
well it depends on your definition of released
well it did! it did!
well it died for some readon
well it dies in the worker thread too
well it doesn't fly with me that i am on call whenever i am in the office to drop whatever i am doing and help dan sell webcheckout
well it doesn't have the Approach comment on it, that is what I was attempting to find
well it doesn't matter because it will neeed to be done again as that is not the real template
well it doesn't seem to be hanging or anything 
well it don't matter on that instance do it
well it fails due to deprecation warnings
well it gave me the unrecognized language error
well it got more intimate
well it happened and i c an reproduce it
well it has something to do with editing reservations... see lori's email from yesterday
well it has to be a failure in alloc-rules
well it has to query every person when it renders the page, no?
well it helped 
well it is
well it is it's an image its just called something else...
well it is not a one time fix thing
well it is the name getting that does it, let me loo real quick
well it is torn up and it is in your head
well it just got finished yesterday no?
well it just says IMAP so i guess not
well it just took 14 seconds on their box
well it looks damned interesting but i can't find the source or enought doc to use it
well it looks like it choked on people
well it looks like the sides of such a hat, but with hair in the middle
well it looks like this:
well it looks like update-dump-to-freeze but i don't see it anywhere in the code?
well it looks like you added yourself?
well it looks like you have 7 bitchx's going but only two have tty's when i ps
well it measn there was an error and you are continuing witht he assumption it will be handled
well it might be abug in the demo set
well it might be one other thing hold on
well it might make me feel better but of course all the SI guys would feel inadequate...
well it needs up-to-date usql anyways
well it never tells you exactly what the conflict is
well it now sets schedulator duration by the reservation-advance-limit + max-checkout-reservation-length
well it obviously proceeds ...
well it only even defuns it if wcof-version equals 2.0
well it puts us back intoa  respoactable place with regards to bugs
well it ran
well it relies on human control at a predogmatic stage
well it seems a common situation...
well it seems like netscape stops rendering at the end of the status thingy
well it seems that some folks are missing including jeff pearson, one of our main contacts, they are not being deleted but being marked as inactive, or is that the same thing
well it seems you aren't happy with me doing my work here, so yes.
well it should be but ns 4.7 doesn't work right
well it should be done
well it should be easy then...it's just not working
well it should go off without a hitch then, we'll see
well it still beats the hell outta realaudio
well it still shouldn't say Person:
well it takes place in the late 70's
well it throws a kink in my plan to have ResourceScheduler contain bitmap widgets
well it used to be that the deliver-to property returned either or
well it used to check for conflicting reservations, but it seems to skip that step now
well it used to work...
well it was committed
well it was definitely fixed in 1.8.4 ... so i dunno what could have broken in 1.8.5 that would cause leakage
well it was our bug that starved out all the RAM
well it was rinnert, he never bitches up a storm
well it was wierd I had bad insomnia last night too
well it wasn't so much for eric as the main business owner
well it wasn't very convincing
well it will work, but then you will have the other instance with bad cached data if it makes any changes
well it worked... if we could preload it might be nice though from here
well it works fine now
well it works ok for me
well it would come in handy with the cleaning lady for instance
well it would keep me from stealing the session
well it would seem to not be the same type of burp, which required an ifconfig to reset
well it's 3k resources total, not per rtype
well it's 85% webcheckout and 15% opbs
well it's a bit late to change migration strategy
well it's a bug on 3.0
well it's a feature that used to work, so...
well it's a good story and i won't rain on his glamour rock parade
well it's a logging stub
well it's a minor inconvenience but it installs hella faster from the scsi drive
well it's a property name change
well it's a whole lot more encouraging when my lunch doesn't look like the contents of a dead cow's stomach...
well it's a whole lot nicer than GO SOAK YOUR HEAD
well it's all i know besides javyscript and lingo :P
well it's all in the name of eliminating ways for allocations to get into weird states
well it's allowed, just that you would have to explicitely roll it back still
well it's also bad that they have the default password for org webcheckout
well it's an intermittent poop smell
well it's at least marginally fix it or risk hanging instances randomly while testing
well it's awful nice for having whipped it up in a half a day...
well it's been a blast anyhow
well it's been that way since Feb
well it's blocking Dr. DavenSnort
well it's broken
well it's creating events but not the allocations
well it's fairly obvious that cmucl is abusing its privelege to overcommit memory
well it's fine for you to tell me that
well it's for the best
well it's good they got it early, he's pretty upbeat about it
well it's got an IP now...
well it's gotta be outside the firewall if it's blocking my home connection to gopher
well it's grad-level stuff right?
well it's hard not to get testy when shit goes so pearshaped all the time
well it's hard when it's dan calling to conference me in
well it's how i interpreted your doctrine
well it's in the debug package
well it's in the header...
well it's in there and according to the internet it works 
well it's injecting the seperator, as well as properlydisplaying the element values themselves
well it's just because they get used so much
well it's kinda flakey still
well it's like a 3way relationship
well it's like i get a different behavior every time i try to initialize database
well it's logged on the allocation as never being picked up and then cancelled just now
well it's looking alot better now than it was 90 days ago
well it's looking in cl-library
well it's moot because the app just crashed

well its a still life so its there when you have a sec
well its hard to have faith in a browsers interpretation of a comment in the body tag

well now we have to ensure the opposite
well obviously
well obviously it works when configured correctly
well obviously our old one was faulty

well of course
well of course :)
well of course canging something is a step backwards if you don't do it right 8)
well of course he didn't put that in the email did he
well of course not :)
well off to vote
well offhand i wouldn't mind postponing the release until you guys are done with the NYU spec so you could help absorb some of the yech support calls
well ok
well ok so who adapted location-scheduling to use wall-time?
well ok that's that
well ok then
well ok, I'll send the cache unification text to webco-devel, remove it from there and just put TODOs in there
well ok, i'll fix em up tomorrow i guess
well okay
well okay then
well old and new CMUCLs are at least consistent, in that defmacro behaves the same as destructuring bind

well since sing is off I am in cambodia
well since that fax machine is trashed...
well since theres' no schema  change, and it was ensured on 1.8.1...

well that and because the lock on door is brken
well that bug was kinda lame, but still worthy of filing
well that depends on whose grave you are digging feh true
well that does me no good whatsoever
well that doesn't do me much good does it
well that doesn't make sense bill
well that explains why I couldn't find eric anwhere in the building.
well that explains why cvs is not adding new dirs by default when i up
well that file hasn't been modified since 7PM yesterday
well that helps. @:)
well that i agree
well that is adam's hobby
well that is trivially fixable
well that is very good indeed

well that one is excellent
well that one was a different track
well that one's fucked up
well that other function did the opposite

well that took me forever
well that was before craig fixed the reservation edit bug
well that was on the screen when i logged in, i tried interrupting it and nothing happened, so i killed the lisp process and restarted it 
well that was uninspiring
well that wasn't it
well that won't be ixed in the beta update today
well that would be a two step process
well that would be silly wouldn't it
well that would explain it
well that'll make it pretty hard to look at it
well that's a bug!
well that's a bummer
well that's a relief
well that's a specific use
well that's always a good skill to have imho
well that's an exaggeration
well that's awful thoughtful of ye

well that's certainly one way to reproduce it *sometimes*
well that's critical
well that's different
well that's dum
well that's good because he wouldn't want to paralyze any normals
well that's how many resources have been allocated
well that's kinda useless for me
well that's less annoying
well that's no fun
well that's no good
well that's not MY fault
well that's not a big deal is it?
well that's not a lie
well that's not een the specified patron import format
well that's not entirely accurate i guess
well that's not even remotely true actually
well that's not the message I asked you about!
well that's not too bad
well that's not up to us
well that's one place to get chili i guess 
well that's probably safer for them than NY
well that's reassuring
well that's simple:
well that's the first time i've had any platform weirdness since installing linux on the mac...

well that's why!
well thats 50% of what i know already 
well thats too bad if you type it in
well thats what it tells me
well thats why im here
well the abuse fine can be used for other stuff 
well the alarms purports to be deactivated but the beeeeeeeeeeeep noise is erupting from the basement like a white hot ear poker
well the album was to be called Smile but BW scrapped it before it was finished and some enterprising engineer did a rather hasty mix of what was finished and bootlegged it, under the title Smiley Smile post-BW's abortion of the album

well the encoder on my ultra box is still slow, but much faster than my p-90
well the error was that it couldn't find one of the packages it was trying to load ... i.e webcheckout which is now :wco
well the expansion of data from marc records is, the indexing algorith is not
well the flag I added is not part of that logic, it's just used to track what the person intended to do with the new alloc they are creating.  It doesn't effect logic in the circulation form, just tells the session-allocation webmethod what mode to seed it in.
well the frame storage system is like that, with two differences
well the framework-session gets reaped while it's still in use but the application instance doesn't know it
well the full-on pro-tools system only uses the host CPU for display, all the number crucning is on their hardware
well the general concepts remain the same

well the nice thing about exporting the results is they can just run a huge query and tailor all the results themselves in access or filemaker
well the non offline one
well the only way i would think you woulnd't be able to be burned out on something is if you took a nice long break from it
well the origin of conciousness is a worthy ionvestigation
well the original reservation was made 9-13
well the other Powercomputing boxes will accept g4, just not PCP
well the part about over-analyzing everything
well the postinst failed because i Ctlr-c'd out when it stuck, but webc heckout is running
well the problem as i know it is i get WCOF Error: Container node not found
well the problem is any validation code would be unable to differentiate them to
well the problem is digital recording loses an infinite amount of data, compared to analogue, which only loses a finite amount
well the problem is that between 1.6 and 1.6.2 any time user tried to edit the condition note for a resource, they wound up creating another metadata row with the condition subtype
well the problem is the only way to save on the reservation detail screen is to commit
well the problem is the total only looks for late fees not usage fees

well the repeating resources one was valid
well the replacement text has the work box in it... i think people might be offendecd

well the solution is for it to have it rename itself all by itself i guess
well the sql portion is nice and neat
well the stcc folks have been nothing but  charitable
well the thing is it don't matter much
well the thought was if they had the server up and ready to go we should install 2.0.x on it if 3.0v is not ready to go
well the tizzy is going to come when we have to push aside other features to implement that one
well the tourists are gonna see it
well the ucb instance is _almost_ finished restoring
well the variable you need ot set is debug::*gc-verbose*
well the war will improve the economy
well their main admin is out today
well then
well then Ig uess she's done!
well then adam, we obviousl have a vocab problem since I was a major controibutor to the code that checks those manymany other things
well then cold kick it
well then i don't feel so bad about the jhu situation
well then i suspect a bug in authentication.lisp
well then i will try waiting longer
well then i would wager it would take me like 150 to 180 hours :)
well then i wouldn't worry about it for 3.0
well then i'm all for UI 
well then it's decided
well then it's locations for you m'lady
well then let us do the fresh choice since we all know we likes it
well then maybe i wool stay
well then no printing for them
well then prolly 3-4 hours
well then stop asking questions with obvious answers
well then that explains that
well then that makes sense
well then the head version of mod_webapp is the one to use
well then they can delete it
well then they probably do
well then we just bill em
well then we need to fix that
well then what can I say?  You are on RH right?
well then why don't we have a shell script that does the whole install ?
well then winmodem probably doesn't have too much stuff that depends on it, so youre probably safe building it yourself

well uncommonsql-mysql should
well under way. i move we adjourn.
well unfortunately nobody will ever shell out $40k for an RPM so we're forever stuck working on paid enhancements without the option to solidify a package install
well unless the app is suddenly so stable it will require no console interaction ever
well unless youhae specific bug numbers or things for me to fix...
well update and try and reproduce 2127 and 2128
well update-dump-from-freeze should do it for you

well we need a bass player before we are really any good
well we need to figure out what's broken in dumpy dumpling land
well we need to store all of the subfields for the author entries, we also need one or more collated versions of the author for indexing
well we should check that there is something besides   then
well we should have a snapshot from between the 4th and the 2.0.2 migration
well we should just make craig do it!
well we should remove the broken scripts
well we should standardize that off the bat
well we shouldwork on migration then

well what about suggests
well what about the trivial bugs?
well what advantages does the 2xCPU give?
well what are they doing showing up in the circulator in the first place then?

well what eric got was basically an earful from 3 different developers who are rather frustrated with the situation
well what happened to dan?
well what if somebody tries to call tech support
well what if they started smoking because it was so stressful driving in rush-hour traffic?
well what if you want to change a message number by recompiling, smarty?

well what other limits will the schedulator consider?
well what should i do... i can't find any trace of anything regarding this missing patron
well what the fuck, i have IMAP selected
well what the hey then
well what was going on on prep?

well what's the autoconf do in this release?
well what's the status of mod_webapp devel?
well what's with that warning?
well what's with the allocation log rendering stuff in find-activity-form.lisp?
well whatever causes this error 
well whatever, it's surmountable i'm sure
well whatever, it's their box
well wheaton hasn't reported this yet, so maybe it's a display issue on my end ...
well when i ran that shortcut you made for me adrun...the application turned up this >: Exception during run:
well when then?
well when we restore it, it should be obvious

well yeah if you grab them or smoething
well yeah!
well yeah, at that spot a ray of pure unreflected light is drilling thru your virtual skull
well yeah, but he doesn't know that now, does he
well yeah, but where from there sweetie?
well yeah, we cleaned up the bugs and they haven't made any new ones
well yes
well yes and no
well yes and no.  I changed them to symbols because the media search screen was calling get-class-index-by-use with a symbol, not a keyword.
well yes but why do you hate it now
well yes, in retrospect it appears to have generated some bugs eh
well you are modifying the DB and then checking the object in memeory
well you asked them to use support 8)
well you better do some more research
well you better write good manuals :)

well you could do that ... 
well you could drop off the onshore insurance and get bluecross couldn't you?
well you could pop the caches 
well you didn't get assigned to i can count to 10 one
well you don't disillusion yourself that all good software is bug free
well you fire up that one and the stove-top spresso and things are really pumpin
well you found what you were looking for regarding their edit-state bugs right?
well you got a lot of em I think
well you got to get the good bits of the war done in time to process the video in time for 5:30 nat'l news
well you kind of don't work there
well you know
well you know how it goes
well you know it's better to file it as a bug on the actual action, tha a generic reaper bug
well you know, it's the olive skin and the spanish locks
well you missed out then
well you misspelled misspelled
well you need a little somthing for yourself :)

well you should bump up the mobo
well you should get some... esp josh who's been on it so long
well you should have a party for him with male strippers
well you should just login as webcheckout!
well you should point out to him that overmanaging you is not going to make you feel much like sticking around
well you should read up on him, he did some absolutely nutty stuff
well you should set them up right
well you should support 'em all!
well you should toss that in there somewhere
well you shouldnt' :)
well you understand that source and binary are stored seperatly right?
well you weren't on late last night :)
well you would use f-secure or nifty telnet to ssh to my machine...
well you wouldn't want internal versioning to be out of sync with public opinion
well you wouldn't want to have the customers think that there was no difference between version 3 and version 4
well you'd have to cut-n-paste, it would just save like 8 lines of code
well you'd still have to chase out the freaky bugs right?
well you'll have to bail him out
well you're a programmer
well you're prolly using the umich config as your checklist for things that need to be done, so having me in there would be redundant
well you're ratio of give:take isn't as high as pams :)

well, 26.00 GBP 
well, 3 actually

well, 3.0 is woody
well, 4.76 is choking on the java as well
well, 42 * 2 == 84

well, I am mostly thru server, just going over the more radically mutated stuff, like circulation form
well, I am not gfixing that tonite
well, I am old and crotchety
well, I am supposed to be taking Friday off, but considering the time and how horrid my head feels, not too mention being May Day, I think I should switch it to today
well, I am trying to load demo dataset in 3.1  I don't see a way to do that with cmucl and the previous run-script mechanism
well, I asked for help in shutting down bugs
well, I assigned that over to craig
well, I assigning you so much less than I assign myself or the senior developers
well, I assume cbl and jesse can speak more to the feasability of this sort of test.
well, I believe in that too, though
well, I believe we'll have inet ssh inbound when their new box is in place
well, I bet he retires and they hire him back part-time ina  few months when he is bored
well, I better get my ass moving with the releae notes

well, I bounced your list off them...
well, I bring coffee treetz and my smooth talking, suve demeanor
well, I can I think if I call it cl-library:htdocs
well, I can add a don't build docs flag
well, I can ask Richard to cancel these and reenter them but if it comes up again we really have to do something, they think the application is very unstable because random, very frustrating things like this creep up for them a lot
well, I can at least say that my curve is getting better
well, I can at least tyr to confirm it if you want, first
well, I can back up webco.artic.edu to 1.6.1, then rerun migration, and give yo uthe log
well, I can build that as wrappers around cache-get
well, I can certainly opine if you send sql trace to webco-devel
well, I can do it tomorrow
well, I can do that for internal network, don't really wanna bother with a per customer config on 3 servers I have to maintain
well, I can email them
well, I can help with the website...it's been on my todo for a while

well, I can ping accross covad again
well, I can point out that rtype a->b->c was showing as such in the rsrc detail and rtype screens, but b was showing as a root rtype ...
well, I can prolly speed it upa  bit, but not much
well, I can put it any other color, so long as its not white
well, I can say, they kinda suck
well, I can see the open times on the calendar view
well, I can split my time between docs and bug fixing but expect it drag the docs out quite a bit
well, I can try to fix it myself
well, I can try to get it I guess
well, I can upgrade them with that one file off the branch rather than frozen
well, I can work around it for awhile
well, I can't
well, I can't change history, boyo
well, I can't creep into the minds of the powerful, so who knows
well, I can't do media search thus I can't check if it's fixed or not, thus I will skip it

well, I can't turn it off 
well, I can't use the cam to boss you unless you point it at the screen too
well, I cannot say it has not rubbed off on me a bit with that server
well, I cant complain that my task doesnt introduce more of the system to me
well, I cant even start my instance
well, I cleared out some stuf...
well, I cna' trelaly help
well, I commited it
well, I consider that crappy, maybe it's a good thing
well, I coudl autoconf it and put it in site-config.lisp ?
well, I coudl easily handle that in the autoconf side
well, I could call it 'snapshot-data' if we're worried ?
well, I could have written a transponder method which submitted to the server a please add this date to thie period and returned a new date
well, I could see them being elided from the post-confirmation screen, to save space and since you can't change them there anyways
well, I cuold hook up a mic
well, I decided to do something adventerous
well, I did anyhow
well, I did look into a bit, got confused

well, I don't know what you want from me if you're not willing to spend the time to tell met
well, I don't know why.
well, I don't like not having more notice, but you surely deserve a break from the frantic last few weeks
well, I don't need a core per se
well, I don't need it
well, I don't pay much attention to all that
well, I don't plan on modifying the code for it, just creating the proper data structures 
well, I don't see that changing.  We are not going to become a alibrary catalog system anytime soon
well, I don't see what overtime has to do with 2.4 or 2.5 in particular
well, I don't think it will be as bad as 1.6.[123] were
well, I don't think offline indefinately was broken in 2.0.4
well, I don't think they have a josh voodoo doll
well, I don't understand why the same validation can't be applied whenver a field changes
well, I don't wanna bother hearing fud about it
well, I don't want to spend too many cycles on formatting at this point, with so much content still needed, but I couldn't help adding a bit of useful color...
well, I dont know how to build the module
well, I dont know that it is all of onshores fault
well, I dont see it in what I have here.
well, I dont think its called that
well, I doubt it will break things
well, I dunno
well, I dunno about 2.0.2... I was going to do it tomorrah since I'm tired
well, I dunno...
well, I emailed staff to that effect on monday, so yes, hopefully
well, I ended up popoing the stack on the umich lisp instance
well, I feel bad because Im the one who's been interacting with their IT
well, I filed a bug
well, I find with documentation I don't really get chopping until I'm 2 hours into it
well, I found one bug then
well, I go eat now
well, I go for real
well, I go now
well, I got a big reply for don... still need to re-review your guys crazed tactical analyses
well, I got craig safe and sound on the train on sat morning and sent him on his way... we've been finding stuff he forgot ever since. @:)

well, I guess I was nudged in the we cant live without you direction
well, I guess Ill start by getting it to build, then I will fix the PG6 error
well, I guess bughunting is to be expected, 1.8.1 was big enough
well, I guess he has a point.  From now on I will be conservative.
well, I guess im close to an authority on those
well, I guess it really shoudl be on an image
well, I guess it was already on the branch wasnt it
well, I guess it's a good thing
well, I guess its time to eduacte myself up on the patron integrations
well, I guess someone fixed it already
well, I guess stuff like that is properly addressed in the sched rework of 2.0
well, I guess there are 280 words with j in the middle of the word in my dict file.  Much less interesting
well, I guess there are sockets, no sessions
well, I guess track down any references to that and kil them
well, I guess you just have to lump it for the moment and work with what's there, no ?
well, I guess you won't behaving any coffee then!
well, I had better start rolling
well, I had take a break
well, I had the classes defined already so maybe something in the class redefinition code deals with it properly
well, I have 128 megs.  Its pageing like a librarian
well, I have a ghz machien here at home.  At least I can vompile the app in less than an afternoon here

well, I hope this bitch compiled
well, I hope this bitch compiles
well, I hope to at least be able to have him review it by end of day
well, I htink there is a shift in how power operates
well, I identified the problem now that I know what that format is, you answered my question already
well, I just added some stuff...
well, I just commited on the maint branch some code to make it a variable driven option
well, I just committed some changes to the data integration spec; mostly regarding holds
well, I just did my good deed of the day.
well, I just fixed one thing in server, ayres bad
well, I just got a bit of the 2.0 changes done...
well, I just looked thru changeslogs and I can't find it eiather, your commit msgs suck
well, I just ran jesse's import stuff
well, I just told him he needs to probably configure lpd on the MacOSX box and setup his station, yadda...
well, I just wanted to pester him with some questions about hackney
well, I know gordon needed it... some other projex entries might talk about it
well, I know it's a dispaly abstraction borrowed from CLIM
well, I know that it is to be taken with a grain of salt.
well, I know what he is talking about, sometimes the whole page doesn't load, it's ther 
well, I know whats wrong but I dont know how to fix it.
well, I know where my ilisp error lives
well, I know, but I cant tell why they are there
well, I know...
well, I love thailand but being a professor here for 600 $ a month just is not quite ideal if you di me
well, I mean, suppress the operator tab from displaying when the person you are looking at is not an operator at all
well, I mean, that's not all... but
well, I meant my ssh public key, sorry 8)
well, I meant same os build, etc
well, I mentioned the general outline above
well, I might as well try it out
well, I might be able to get more of it ...
well, I might need to get to prep, we'll see
well, I must say, given my level average enebriation for the last moth or so, I'm surprised I'm not in jail or debtors prison
well, I need 1.8.
well, I need 2928 to be dealt with
well, I need f000000d

well, I personally don't think the defaulting issue is allt hat problematic
well, I prefer as email first, but bugs eventually if it fits
well, I prefer bickering, but, ...
well, I probably wouldn't bother today but eventaully, I suggest just pull the IDE, reformat scsi, install on scsi
well, I propose that we either make the index server perform the object tree traversal in the queries if we want it to be a distinct process, or that we keep the query system in the framework process and add the substring matches and such
well, I ran it for 6 hours with no luck
well, I realize that
well, I really gotta scoot, wife is waiting at vaselka
well, I realy only need to understand one function, since it relates to an interface to schedules
well, I reckon it would slow down the initial connection, then its just the overhead of a symetric cypher
well, I reconfigured it for you
well, I reiterated to Pam that I'm doing all spec work
well, I screwed up in my commit...
well, I see from a bug, that customer had done some fiddling in their db
well, I set a max of 5 and a min of 20 and it wants to charge 5
well, I should change that
well, I should have some time to go over any redsign later today
well, I should have this answered before I progress any further
well, I shouldn't say care...
well, I sorta forgot
well, I stated it slightly different
well, I suppose it can be done
well, I suppose wether you call it a cache or not is subjective.  Note that ec-get-object goes thru that transaction first
well, I tailing the dump file, and the way I have things written its dumping an allocation schedule ever 30 seconds.
well, I think 1.8.2 isa branch of frozen
well, I think 3.0.x == 3.0.3
well, I think I need help with some branch issues
well, I think Im done in ....
well, I think dan needed the demo 3.0ish  up tonight
well, I think it could be done, by providing a class list to compare as opposed to doing class counts on all classes
well, I think it depends on data set
well, I think it made a difference in clarity
well, I think it really is a local-time in terms of expected behavior as opposed to a wall-time

well, I went to the DC actions, the organizers said 500k, and I can tell you that I have never in my life seen that many people in one place

For now, that means that when you go to Web sites, buttons can light up and sound effects can play when you interact by clicking or moving the pointer over things.

well, first it was emitting showers of sparks. then he fixed if and now it just does nothing
well, first thing is to find a good tester with the time
well, first, do you understand the problem?
well, fitz is mad
well, flyspell is too stupid to know that XML tags are not words that should be spellchecked, you just have to tolerate that
well, foot foot
well, for *our* purposes... I would just say make the whole damn pkg depend on cmucl and enable that autoload ...
well, for example, circrculation-policy precidence is not working
well, for example, if the resource IDs were too big to fit in the columns provided
well, for instance checkout-contents takes the oid of the current allocation to filter REvents when editing a reservation ... 
well, for instance, umich customization spec has a specialization for pending overdue.... let me scan that for a sec
well, for my 2 boxen + 1 monitor, I think about 12 minutes
well, for now do you think it's worth it to try and implement a special
well, for once I dont blame him :)
well, for one ilisp is not required
well, for one thing I don't think it's a conscious process on the part of the actors
well, for one we don't have a modem connection :)
well, for one, ID field should be first field
well, for one, reservations by resource type will never find non-circulating resources
well, for one, we need add to checkot... on the title level in addition to holding level
well, for one, we really gotta clear out the back-log in TODO
well, form where I was, it was actually very silent ... just a slow collapse in place
well, four bars in one night eh gracchus?
well, frances who?
well, freeze mostly meaning have everyone review it
well, friday
well, from their list of features to remove, we can add our own, and provide pricing...
well, froma  branch working copy, that will diff from your working copy to the last commit on the branch
well, fuck
well, fwiw, I think every library I've ever worked in has allowed overdues to be renewed unless somebody else had placed a reservation on the resource, with fines placed for the amount of time the item was late.
well, g'head
well, gauntlet, anyhow
well, gay-like
well, generaly the machine was setup properly
well, get it to connect to template1 instead of postgres and se what happens
well, get rid of the sql indexes perhaps
well, getting intimate with lru-cache 8)
well, getting it to a vanguard would shake things out too
well, give me an instance to try it on and I'll check
well, gnus is hosed
well, go ahead and leave it at that then
well, go there, click on list admin overview page
well, good
well, good for depreciating rent prices in NYC anyhow
well, good news adam, we are on top of all the bugs 8)
well, good question
well, good, cause I just had to keep you arguing long enought o implement the fix in the other window
well, good. that means Im not totally clueless then
well, goodnight then
well, got 10 2.1 bugs, several of them will be closed tommorow morning
well, got a query for A in the title and location FVL where 18k+ records are in FVL down to 8 second from submit to display
well, got further along, gotta solve the psheet problem right to get any further, so I'm gonna commit what I have so far
well, gotta call wheaton too
well, gotta crash
well, gotta go soon
well, gracchus is The Lyrical Master
well, gracchus is a sweety isn't he
well, gracchus is the lyrical mastah
well, grasped -- penetrated by reason
well, group expiry dates for instance .. all the calls in to that nee dto be checked
well, group-open-type returns NIL for each of them.
well, guess you'd better get going then. @:)
well, guy is wearing a Winter coat on a hot indian summer day
well, guys, I gotta step out, crisi with eric's debit card
well, guys, I have a RFP response going down... I'll need some help with hours estimatation, probably tonight or tomorrow
well, guys, I never approved runing 2 ASP instnaces
well, guys, I'm off for mtg which may take all day...
well, guys, can you please turn off all alarms
well, guys, time to shut this old box down
well, hackslut is onshored bitches...
well, had a fine meeting
well, had the virtualhost changes I made been a problem aI want to have said I was gonna do it
well, had we had the personnel and resources for an official testing mgr, sure.
well, half of them were in holidays
well, has saic got any autocirc stuff going on?
well, has the migration process already been updated?
well, have a great time!
well, having MS behind it is a mixed blessing...
well, he did a famous spood on it
well, he didn't think it was convenient enough
well, he gets tifs and some gifs, but other gifs turn out blanks
well, he got arrested, does that count?
well, he hasnt been very comunicative
well, he is the envelope that got sent to senator daschle and he has a bag of white powder that he's throwing on people
well, he means popularity, I think
well, he might not have put it up for download, he did just say that it's like damn near ready for another release. 
well, he ran dhow the hallway to catch up with me
well, he saw the dude, and the dude saw him see him
well, he sorta cheats with himself
well, he still hasn't said what setting he had it on
well, he was here ..
well, he with least seniority is the whipping-boy, so it has been for days eternal
well, he won't have to wait that long 8)
well, he wont get that
well, he'll pay for it soon I'm sure.  Every rich black man does eventually
well, he's doing us a favor being the vanguard
well, he's gonna be alright, but his heart is badly damaged and they are considering a bypass
well, he's got a real sadistic side
well, he's just a mook, what do you expect
well, he's really kinda an sociologist on a certain level
well, he's still here - snoozing on the couch @:)
well, he's still into it but it doesnt hog all his time 
well, he's switching on c-l-c in dot-cmucl.tmpl as well..
well, heard that one before :0
well, hell.  I cant recreate it
well, hello
well, helped invent
well, her concern is spamming folks
well, here and there i guess...
well, here's the facts
well, here's the heuristic: if there's a workaround, it's not going to get fixed in 18x line
well, heres the haps:
well, hes also dead
well, hes weaknesses are brevity, and a lack of followup
well, hes, out ofthe office next week
well, hi!
well, him and lois
well, his explanation of why was good
well, his health is the reason he retired, but the timing is still trippy
well, his mom says he's in florida but doesn't elaborate
well, his name is racy and he's the demolition guy smashing our house and he is 2nd degree black belt in hapkido
well, his problemo is that we have to train him on the app...
well, his question doesn't make sense because we have no way to know what the pickup reshelf interval is
well, history is funny
well, hmm, let me think about that tho.  You might be right
well, hmm, wonder where would be a good place to test it
well, hmmmm
well, hold on that one for momento
well, hold on, is it really a P1 blocker?
well, honestly, isis don't got shit
well, hop to it.  I expect pollo at my door in seven days. 
well, hopefully it will work now
well, hopefully it's modern?
well, hopefully someone did
well, hopefully the rewrite karl is doing will be better
well, hopefully we can muddle through this week with preliminary testing internally
well, how about just that last line for each question
well, how about this
well, how about this:
well, how are things going with dag -- is he able to credibly handle support calls?
well, how do we create a dynamic extent for the rendering function then?
well, how do you think I learned what I knwo about it?
well, how was i supposed to know
well, how was the game?
well, however it works
well, i am
well, i am back
well, i am in gracchus's new laptop rock group or the #1 reason i come to work
well, i await your premier motion picture
well, i be ready
well, i broke for simpsons
well, i can
well, i can't keep putting it off -- i've gotta go home.
well, i compiled a violin
well, i could not see any instrux about how to specify what number it gets
well, i could probably have all the bugs closed by the end of next week, but i'd like to take some extra time to do things better, improve performance etc
well, i could see maybe ldap being separate tho
well, i couldn't get the latest version without cvs now could i?
well, i cvs updated enteract and that didn't fix the prelogin home, so i don't know what's up with that
well, i did it with 10 ppl and 8 rtypes 
well, i do but mine i think are more involved because im modifying the values. That requires an extra step but...
well, i do have a witty retort to the meat comment, but i will refrain from using it
well, i do hope she's happy in the dancing and the teaching, but i wish she would stay
well, i don't have a copy ... but i'll make something up
well, i don't know if they're clamoring for any 3.0 features...
well, i don't see why building mod_webapp requires cmucl?
well, i dont know what they are installing on the box yet
well, i doubt that
well, i dunno
well, i figured we'd have to go out there a couple of times to coordinate with them
well, i for one, say 'down with france, boo boo boo!' take your goddard and jacques brel and cram 'em up your rootin tootin eiffel tower
well, i found the room but there was absolutely nothing in the room
well, i get paid 15 USD an hour
well, i got it so i can hear the demo sesh they have ut im having trouble hearing my inmputs
well, i got the sytax error starting with 'ON' when i used that
well, i gotta get to practicing ... see you tomorrow nite hopefully
well, i guess i'll just chill, hope that raul does it or starts it and either way rely on him to finish it quickly tomorrow
well, i guess it might not be all
well, i guess they'll get better as we all learn to lower our expectations
well, i guess tj said that he shouldn't have it
well, i guess we'll just have angela check over all the ones that she submitted that have been 'fixed'
well, i had a lead on a PIN problem, but I can't reproduce the symptoms of that bug
well, i have the CTT meeting at 1:30. do you have time later today?
well, i have to admit that there were only two of us in the forms competition
well, i have to quit altogether i'm just on my way there slowly
well, i have unread mail
well, i haven't heard from him and my assumption is that he would be in touch with me
well, i haven't seen it.
well, i just want to make sure problems get fixed for our customers
well, i know it was working like 2 weeks ago
well, i know nothing about the psoft integration 
well, i left him a phone message as well
well, i like boys
well, i like violeta as much as the next person, but...
well, i normally smoke prolly 1.5 packs a day
well, i seem to be back
well, i still get the onshore mail but i'm also kdegnan@uchicago.edu
well, i suppose the best solution depends on what im dealing with 
well, i suspect user error, it could be local-time bugs though
well, i thank you
well, i think i'd better head home then
well, i think lyn is working on part 2
well, i think that we really ought to 
well, i think there should be 2 different goals 
well, i though it was worth asking, silly me!
well, i thought about it
well, i told  them how to do that months ago
well, i told you about the bad karma of killing babies
well, i took the prednisone and antibiotic last night and some cough suppresant
well, i want to today at some point
well, i was being persistant
well, i was fine, got just the right amount of drunk
well, i was going to do it during you guys meeting until it was relocated to the main area...
well, i was watching the logs, and some admin dolt just went to the resource-admin screen and then all the requests stopped and top shows a postmaster process skyrocketing up to 99.9% cpu 
well, i was worried for you...and chris...
well, i wasnt' considering that the fine is paid immediately when there is an acct # provided
well, i wonder is 2836 is the same thing
well, i'd think that if postgres package installs binary createuser, it would install everything required to run that too, 
well, i'll ask eric
well, i'll get to the bottom of it.
well, i'll take a look that's a good point
well, i'll take whichever one pam didn't 
well, i'm back
well, i'm confused by it
well, i'm getting boggled by the lisp select method...
well, i'm in the middle of something too
well, i'm just craving food in general -not necessarily out of hunger
well, i'm just firing up my new titanium g4 laptop.
well, i'm looking at kansas and they don't seem to have had the problem
well, i'm mighty confused
well, i'm not interested in recriminations
well, i'm not precisely sure...he applied for 2-3 slightly different jobs there
well, i'm not sure ... where would the archive be?  there's no archive group that i can see
well, i'm not talking about gauging relative speed really, i'm just talking about user perception
well, i'm not to that point yet
well, i'm off to teach my first web authoring in the library tutorial
well, i'm outta here
well, i'm talking about the music
well, i'm trying to add some new subtasks to the testing deliverable
well, i'm trying to figure out if maybe i updated texas to 1.6.1 again
well, i've kind of branched out into Gentle Giant and Van Der Graff Generatro
well, ic
well, ideally, we have 'NEWS' -- what's new in the release
well, ideally... but not practically
well, if DATA is magic, yes
well, if I remember MCO it lets you just add random strings of stuff you are checking out
well, if I traversed relations, but when I traverse relations I am faulting in anew rom the DB, and I will not get the same object B
well, if all that has changed.... perhaps it is no longer the case
well, if eric was aksing around before that, perhapsthat means he thought there was a problem then
well, if everyone is supposed to have it, I can make it turn on for everyone
well, if he blows it all up...
well, if he came in, then they wouldn't count it as a vacation day
well, if i could I'd send yu on a nice trip
well, if i mix 'em all up in a big cup that should cover it
well, if it got by anything specializing on wcof-entity it should be fine
well, if it helps...
well, if it is developed and its unsatisfactory we are out the money in a sence, no?
well, if it was all fun and games they would be less likely to pay us to do it
well, if it werent in LISP.....
well, if it's on our 9-5 period
well, if it's who I think it is, she was one of my students in Rome.
well, if its something you wanna do document-wide consistently, it's best to handle it on the style level
well, if only three weeks woulding it be on the branch?
well, if required, I can ask KU if that's an acceptable change
well, if sales would give me more than 3 hours notice anytime they need the laptop upgraded i'd feel less rushed
well, if that's nacho thing...
well, if that's the course open to us, I guess that's that
well, if the ID is the same, it's the same checkout
well, if the crowd goes I will follow
well, if the three craig mentioned are index related, then not that have been brought to our atteniton on th emilestone
well, if the userid was a long string of digits
well, if there WAS pin overrides you are asking for random brute-force attacks
well, if there are not pressing 3.0 bugs right now, perhaps I should start looking at 3.1?
well, if there is a mixture of items they will still want them one per row
well, if they are already filed, just assign them
well, if they catch you saying anything bad, they immediately ship you out to Cupertino for reprogramming.
well, if they don'tneed it today, on webco
well, if they have a policy of only ever using signed certs from the few the proud, the cert mafia, then perhaps
well, if they want to come over and start aligning our html for maximum visual satisfaction on a pro bono basis, i say more power to them
well, if they were waiting on a mach due in early dec it should be there, if they are planning buying one that implies they havn't even ordered it yet
well, if they weren't ever being generated, than perhaps it was because you did not compile your isntance with #webco-usage-fee-support
well, if we can just chop out all close times, that would be the best It hink
well, if we could target certain sorts of degeneracy we could have a hope of getting decent coverage
well, if we don't have a spec, how can I do an impact analysis and CP?
well, if we get a specific repeatable recipe then we can fix it
well, if we get no responses better, I say we use matt
well, if we make it state inactive, then we have to special case the alloc-rule for that, to see if it is expired or not
well, if we started giving the app away for free, i wager you couldn't meet my salary requirements
well, if what you described is supposed to be implemented already then I have a problem here, because what I see is the old mechanism, using the *need-indexing* special
well, if yall are up for it I can wire that
well, if you are that much opposed to my irc client, you are welcome to  come up here and install something else
well, if you aren't concerned with 7.x you're probably okay with just 8.6 and 9
well, if you ask me, input times thru the interface shoudl be treated like wall clock time
well, if you can spec it we can ask eric about it...
well, if you do bit math, of course, you can fit 8 booleans in a byte
well, if you establish on hours I can try...
well, if you get enough energ to relate it, go ahead, I might be able to finish it off
well, if you had built clean, than it's a bug
well, if you have imho pkg locally, you can do:
well, if you just look at the rest of the doc you can do it
well, if you look at the site...
well, if you paste the fialure I can try to fix it
well, if you read the code you'll see that is wrong
well, if you sshd to irc, then you are where youwanted to go
well, if you update it...
well, if you wanna handle it sure
well, if you wanna learn how to patch I can dteach you....
well, if you want to add input rules for your external interface copy I??external.def to I??esternal.rul
well, ill help by not checking in that 11MB file again
well, ill keep searching
well, im having trouble with that
well, im judging by digidesign.com
well, im just trying to familiarize myself with some of this shit so i know if i care ;)
well, im off to the libary to see if i can get me wireless orinoco card going on me lappie 
well, im partial to the works of such silly people like Di'meola, stanley clarke, yan hammer etc
well, im prolly being confused by the set up menus then
well, im reading about it now, i may need to ask for help
well, im ripping out a couple sentances from a whole section
well, im still here
well, im testing a perl script that does change a file and im using emacs to see the rsult
well, implementation of the entire thing
well, imported isn't really the right term
well, in Delaware you would drive the deisel truck for Hi-Grade dairy, bringing chocolate milk to schools everywhere!
well, in a bit more polish prose
well, in a perfect world they could be separate
well, in all honesty adam, your month timeline from RRT branch merge to release was a bit longer than you had originally proposed
well, in half an hour
well, in that case
well, in the case of policies, it appears that they are not exported entities, being represented as lists on the resource-type object
well, in the context of being a reservation, all that matters is Estimated Fee
well, in the import and integration processes there are places that create lots of entities and they sometimes have to have machinery to deal with the fact that existence tests and such for records are not going to see the other records it has previously imported in a transaction
well, in the last month or so, in terms of real usage, that meaning has changed
well, in the meantime you know how to fix it 8)
well, in the scope of migration, a means of carying data from one instance to another
well, in their webcheckout data they do...
well, in this case there are 5 resource, set strike info, account code info, etc
well, insofar as our goal is to attain the closure of 2.0, I don't think any hire we would make now would hel pmuch
well, installing takes about 2.5 hours at least when I did it
well, instance is the actually scheduled entity
well, integrate it into defsystem
well, interdocument cross-referencing is going to be a problem at some point soon
well, interface wise I'm back where I was last week
well, is it iportant?
well, is it ok to hand edit sgml.catalog?
well, is not being able to create resources a blocker?
well, is that wrong, I dunno...
well, is there a difference?
well, is there a ration or lump amount we always miss by?
well, is there really anything worth pushing out or is this just so we can tie up loose ends on the 1.8 line?
well, is this after migration or no
well, it *dumps* anyway
well, it *said* installation went ok. we'll see
well, it *should* be rebooting
well, it IS kinda funny
well, it WAS a major merge
well, it ain't our fault, we were working on 1.7!
well, it all seems to stem from the TZ environ variable
well, it all seems v. exotic
well, it appears that the wco-default-location for them was never created
well, it bothers me
well, it came in too close to when I'm out of here
well, it can't be automated then...
well, it changes depending on your verison of pgress
well, it complains about some other stuff :)
well, it could be
well, it could be a bug
well, it could complete?
well, it could just be install actually
well, it deletes all of them without resources, i buleeve
well, it deletes the current reservation and creates a fresh one...
well, it depends on how many is in few
well, it didn't 
well, it didn't bitch, lemme try sending some name
well, it didn't come up...
well, it didn't fix the problem
well, it didn't force quick patch releases
well, it does actually, to a limited extent
well, it does come up eventually
well, it does in that I want to verify that I didnt trump your fix, and we know how to discover the problem in those dumps
well, it does need to be something we can tell clients so youre right
well, it does, if you let me continue....
well, it doesn't appear simplified
well, it doesn't even appear to be reformism
well, it doesn't have a lot of electronics in it, it just vomits a frame when you toggle the control bit on the port
well, it doesn't have to replace opus
well, it doesn't help that no one does things I ask for
well, it doesn't matter
well, it doesn't matter for flat
well, it doesn't throw an error
well, it doesn't, appparently
well, it fucks w3 up too
well, it got hot
well, it had alot of fields
well, it had to be asked!
well, it happens to all of us eventaully
well, it has been attempted i've heard
well, it has the proper frozen tag
well, it has to be wco-manual
well, it hasn't been included by default for a while...
well, it is
well, it is a 5 season arc
well, it is a dream ..
well, it is a dynasty
well, it is a mockup
well, it is indeed, isn't it!
well, it is possible
well, it is really ugly, if we can fix it we should.  I couldn't figure out any way to get the task completed 
well, it is the hotest day since...
well, it just doesn't hit the stuff mentioned in the bug
well, it just knew from the get go
well, it just sounds like 5141 might be block on read
well, it kinda is
well, it kinda makes it hard to do anything with allocations
well, it looks better than before...
well, it looks like just c-l-c needs to be updated
well, it makes it clear why it's called an incrmeental fee
well, it makes it so you have to go to another page and back to reset
well, it meaks sense considering it's use
well, it means maintaining two branches for the modules tho
well, it might be possible to fix it just by looking for why it's failing
well, it might go down at some point
well, it moves the date the given number of units forwards in time, or backwards if negative
well, it must be solvable...
well, it must have
well, it needs to be done anyhow I think
well, it never hurts to backup the entire system
well, it only happens when you edit a resource who'se location as no default fine-rate, so it defaults tot he organization fine-rate
well, it prints out like the old vervsion now....
well, it saves you some MOP lookups
well, it says ther will be a WO 5 for Java, but I don't see it saying ObjC will be dropped, although it's kinda obvious that it wouldhappen
well, it says they are errors, i don't believe it
well, it seemed to show failure ok
well, it seems a valid complaint, and regardless of their situation we should fix it on the head IMO
well, it seems like that is how it should work, doesn't it?
well, it seems to be only looking at the event of the current allocation to determine stuff
well, it should be in about 2 weeks I'd guess so we can hope we have overall stability
well, it should work in both places
well, it shouldnt be a long day for you i hope
well, it shouldnt take TOO much work
well, it sorta works 8)
well, it sorta works.. but it doesn't do anything particularly useful
well, it sounds like the tests jesse wrote are idempotent
well, it still existss on HISS06
well, it tends to get blamed for alot of things, not all of them accurate
well, it took a certain amount of provocation
well, it turns no, I didn't forget!
well, it used to return nil, now it returns [empty]
well, it was always a rather elitist phenom
well, it was an applet issue initially
well, it was good talking... I'll have to grill you later on more stuff
well, it was intended to opena discussion on a mailing list, it was his opinion
well, it was kinda fun anyhow
well, it was testing psoft import
well, it was there in front of me all the time. never mind.........
well, it was working until it started crashing
well, it wasn't 29.10 for PPO per period for family before
well, it wasn't my ISP
well, it will come back together soon enough
well, it will do it one last time due to the Makefile files being the old version
well, it won't allow remote root login, or that pwd is not right
well, it won't help if the problem is in C land
well, it worked before right?
well, it works mostly
well, it woudl mean a variabel number of fields per row
well, it would be good to focus on the 1.8.1 bugs
well, it would be nesisary in order to add this fix. 
well, it would have behaved the same way right?
well, it would have logged something prolly
well, it would like be one of the drop downs on the find alloc screen.. that should be in there...
well, it would probalby be ok to disable something liek that sure
well, it would work.
well, it'll artificially raise my bug count
well, it's 'make install' not the default target
well, it's *a* tab
well, it's *a* tag
well, it's 2.0.9.2 .... it's pretty easy to just pull in the cinapps stuff
well, it's DOE funded, so I guess so.
well, it's NIL
well, it's a bootstrapping problem
well, it's a different kind of talent ... it's more like figuring out what people respond to rather than creating works of genius
well, it's a fixed set, assumed customized via some sort of lisp config file
well, it's a join slot
well, it's a questionable issue
well, it's a rule, IMO
well, it's a set
well, it's a sysadmin problem IMHO
well, it's all about power to weight
well, it's almost as slow
well, it's also because of it's status as a universal
well, it's always a hack 
well, it's always tough building a new business on a shoestring
well, it's an easy way to restart postgres
well, it's been fun.
well, it's been nice visiting.
well, it's cascading
well, it's clear no one has tested usage fees in the least, sigh
well, it's close enough ...
well, it's closer anyways
well, it's complicated
well, it's consistent anyway
well, it's docbook MXL files that get turned into HTML suitable for slides I think
well, it's easy enough toc omment out of tickets.lisp
well, it's easy to change
well, it's easy to fix with finding and replacing
well, it's empty
well, it's fairly obvious to the user
well, it's for the best
well, it's from 1.8 so it's easy to migrate
well, it's funny
well, it's got several users
well, it's hair cutty time again
well, it's important that they be able to differentiate between checkouts and reservations tho
well, it's installed ok on alpha and prep and such
well, it's installing
well, it's intense, but so is being under-employed. I used to be a receptionist, and I can chatter away. @:)
well, it's just a metadata property, so start grubbing
well, it's just a warning, not an error
well, it's just media search and display, nothing very complex
well, it's like 16, but they count on them differently
well, it's like a one line SQL thing ... 
well, it's like cattle, take out back shoot em and sell the remains to the chicken processing plant down the street, or the pizza supply place next-door and they can make lynerroni
well, it's mentioned on our main page, and there is not much we can do to stopthe hostname from showing up
well, it's more complex than that 8)
well, it's more complicated than that...
well, it's more like aknown symptom.  It has been reported several times on the list.
well, it's more specific ... it's for checking inventory at a location
well, it's my time rather than yours...
well, it's new world
well, it's no biggie
well, it's no biggie, you can 'update-to-frozen' with the 1.8 tag, even after 1.8.1 becomes frozen
well, it's not 100% ready for that level yet, I can get it there by end of day I think
well, it's not all tha tpressing
well, it's not all that hard...
well, it's not deep, but psoft-interface.lisp is checked in
well, it's not important to boot from it
well, it's not reall implicating future features
well, it's not really an office
well, it's not really our problem
well, it's not really, but we can work around it
well, it's not too bad
well, it's not too scary actually
well, it's not worse up close actually
well, it's not, so good
well, it's notinner workings
well, it's obvious to me that I ain't getting nothing resolved until I arrive at the scene of the crime
well, it's ok
well, it's ok to msg me
well, it's on your queue
well, it's partly just because ther eis  athree way IP switch going on, network level switch, and in between allof it is a firewall that can't do jack shit and I wasn't told about any of that until I discovered myself how stupid it was
well, it's possible that regular printing works allt he same
well, it's possible that some schools may need to wait for the schedule_accel
well, it's possible... 
well, it's pretty clear we can't be releaseable on monday,no?
well, it's pretty fucked
well, it's pretty safe to do 'make install' whenver you're in doubt
well, it's pretty similar
well, it's probably operator error
well, it's raul's actually
well, it's reasonable
well, it's reproducible!
well, it's running
well, it's slow work, but kind of enlightening
well, it's some dell or other with more ram than I ever thought I'd need. @:)
well, it's still a good analogy
well, it's still better than dr.scheme
well, it's taking at least an hour
well, it's the example of physics which gives hope to the idea that reason could grasp the human
well, it's the phone companies fault, not mine.
well, it's there on the head
well, it's two different things.  So far we've given him what was asked, we just didn't estimate the time till completion properly
well, it's up to you
well, it's very complex, but deceptively so.
well, it's very weak.. but at least not export controlled :)
well, it's web-enabled, sure
well, it's what I alwyas say...
well, its IMAP is insecure, that's how we got hacked last year
well, its a little slow on the allocation stuff but it is looking very nice
well, its a pretty good guess that the ones that have great big egg sacks are the females
well, its at least a sign of bad data in the ucb instance
well, its done-ish
well, its fun
well, its hard to say exactly, but I would say > 1,000 records or so
well, its hosing us on roothat
well, its likely to do a great deal of caching
well, its not building for me
well, its not fixed yet, its just maybe fixed
well, its not so much the manpower, but at what point in the process to we expect to do that
well, its now Allocation CK-xxx for ________ was created
well, its prolly an off by one error.  If you remove an intraday node the whole day gets cleared
well, its sql index inserts that are kicking the imports butt
well, its usually ok to toss local edits
well, its your baby
well, jesse broke it..
well, jesse had mentiond today actually
well, jesse has that under control
well, jesse recommended George Smith Steak House
well, jesse rocks more for getting writing the tests and making them all pass

well, jesse's started #invective...
well, jesus is my saving hero!
well, jexxe got opus to do the to and fro
well, jk is a dewd

well, josh should be happy actually
well, josh was wrong
well, josh, I know this is a PITA a bit, but wehave to monitor what dag is doing closely
well, josh, if you got the timne this evening I know we could use help unloading
well, josh, not sure how related this is...
well, just 3645 so far
well, just a little tdying up today with ctt documentation and a couple html things. waiting to get that perlie script now
well, just adding it to the dump doesn't ensure anything in the import does it?
well, just an announcment that we may be attacking other countries
well, just ask
well, just commited
well, just fix it
well, just let me know
well, just reading the email you know
well, just reboot it back into woody then
well, just saic, they are the only ones about to run out of ram
well, just some data in every migratable field
well, just the rtype issue really
well, just the segvs hanging out
well, kathleen is an orange belt, soon to be an orange belt with one stripe
well, kiddies, we got some upgrades to do tonighters
well, kinda
well, kinda, but its just checking once a day
well, krazykat is obviously a mess
well, kristine is the green light fairy, channeler of healing powerz blah
well, last I spoke to you I said that was a recipe for disaster and we need to have both of us working on it together at some level
well, last I was told I shouldnt bother with them, but they are not going away
well, last night I ruined dinner, spilled pasta sauce twice and overcooked the pasta
well, last properly updated
well, last week
well, later guys. gotta get back to work.
well, lee and jesse should add that route
well, left a msg for mary
well, left a voice message for alex saying NO DO THAT
well, lefty is always right
well, lefty is the hottest thing since wool jockstraps
well, less anyhow
well, less at this point
well, let guess anyhow.. it's just an estimate...
well, let me commit first and you guys can test it, my psoft pie is about to burn
well, let me counterpropose
well, let me finish the encoding
well, let me in on the rock star tip too
well, let me know about boog 4039, I can get it if my guess is right?
well, let me know if you need any help...
well, let me know if you need help
well, let me know when its a go, It shoudl go quickly
well, let me know when to recheck
well, let me knwo what it is
well, let me look at 3.0 first
well, let me look at your questions...
well, let me qualify that. a cvs level merge will not work for all files
well, let me retest with the EXACT read bug you put in there
well, let me run my plan by you
well, let me send you a url
well, let me turn off the editable flag on the subject media field and it will work in my instance
well, let the viola jokes flow then
well, let's leave it...
well, let's provisionally plan to release this evening
well, let's say night
well, let's see
well, let's try to think what's happening...
well, let's unlink it then on successful migration, ok?
well, lets assume the docs are right, how many instqances are we hosting?
well, lets be honest
well, lets bring it down to particulars
well, lets do it in 70 mins then...
well, lets just say i don't feel confident that IT has really thought thru this stuff yet
well, lets keep focus on 2.0.1
well, lets not get into semantics
well, lets see
well, lets tag-n-branch Ithink
well, lets take a loook at it together and decide
well, lets take it to a different questiotn
well, lets try it as is today
well, lets try it, what the hell
well, lets work something out then...
well, like many clients, thay can't really effectively manage this stuff so we kinda take that over
well, like the US in the late 90s, Japan had a speculation bubble in the early 90s
well, like, I wanna preemptively fail migraiton if the TZ bug is there
well, like, what do we want to be editable, etc.
well, lisp is querying it, no?
well, lisp is what I is working on
well, literaly would be a streach
well, little helpful scripts actually
well, log in
well, log into it then
well, logging can be finished off on the 2.0 line, no biggie
well, logically an allocation shouldn't change venues
well, look, I need *something* to work with
well, look, galeon embeds it and uses the printing facilities 
well, looking at projex, it is out of date
well, looks like the versions aren't compatible or something
well, looks like there are no major current bugs
well, looks like we have our days tasks set for us
well, loooks like we're release ready
well, lots is a relative term
well, lots of clients want it
well, lots of qualification for my distaste for cars, cabs are not private autos, so I think they are kewl
well, lunch
well, lunch time
well, lyn decided to move to Forest Park
well, make gnus do it
well, make with the rsrc tests I guess
well, making packages for all the little modules, for debian use, is rather labor-intensive
well, man is that like a footnote? forget it...
well, man, apartment hunting continues
well, marginally
well, marty dermer is the fucking antichrist doughboy from hell. He also makes julienne fries!
well, mary has MARC experience
well, mary is bravely trying to catch up to 2.0.7 @:)
well, max is not clear on the procedure he followed.  Simply that he ecided to add 
well, may take a bit to propogate
well, maybe
well, maybe I can do what I wanna get done anyhow
well, maybe I should leave it alone but just not ship it with the package?
well, maybe I shouldn't
well, maybe I stole it from myself, who knows
well, maybe I'm not hitting any but I haven't seen them in awhile. could you verify please?
well, maybe Manowar
well, maybe a couple
well, maybe be specific AND general :-)
well, maybe hot is a streach
well, maybe i am wrong
well, maybe i'll become a billionarisssss and then i could take everyone
well, maybe if i knew what  Prototype mismatch meant
well, maybe is a data prollem
well, maybe josh can do it
well, maybe just cultural tourist
well, maybe let jesse close out the 2085
well, maybe not
well, maybe not pam
well, maybe not.
well, maybe not....
well, maybe shoot them an email
well, maybe some grepping can pick out any badness
well, maybe we should wait until this afternoon to update your instnac for testing, I thinkI can knock out some more bugs before the end of the day
well, maybe you'll have some insight
well, maybe, if I can call it Whoop Ass
well, me too
well, mebbe choose-location.lisp

well, more importantly viz B-52s and their ilk
well, more like 25 I gues
well, more like 30 seconds or 15 seconds on their server
well, more like they continued it
well, more than 5 months for release testing eh?
well, most of that stuff is in the installation docs actually
well, most of the code assumed the old scheduler architecture
well, most of the way there.  It now seems to gracefully ignore the intraday periods
well, mostly
well, mostly wunderbar
well, moving beyond my incapability to visualize it, how can we be sure this will perform adequate with a huge heap?
well, much of that is already in  there
well, multiple intepretations ofg dumping
well, must dahsh

well, my instance has 4 million
well, my laptop, or any client with that installed can use the VPN
well, my new pen is gone.  It was bound to happen
well, my part
well, my phone magically lost dialtone last Wednesday and they still haven't fixed it.
well, my position is that I am generally *for* freeing the enabling bits, but generally pessimistic about our ability to make money without treating the code which represents the particular advantage of the application as a whole
well, my process goes soemthing like this:
well, my quick fix was wrong tho
well, my snot is clear
well, my wife is partial to styling my hair in a ridge down the middle
well, nate has a wife and no money ... kinda puts a damper on the whole touring lifestyle
well, nearly 11
well, nesta may or may not be right

well, no immediate danger anymore
well, no its a PC.  Grane is the host name i believ3
well, no mod_webapp update
well, no need to, the impact analysis is as far as I've thought it through to date
well, no ones been able to reproduce it... 
well, no other ones that you have worked on or know about, right?
well, no problem, but apparently it gets planted on you
well, no programming items at all?
well, no that's not true
well, no war has ever been of known dimensions and duration, really?
well, no wonder it didn't work. I forgot to commit about 6 files after I got my tea... @:)
well, no wonder my tracing didn't show anything .. there are two lisp processes on evergreen and i was in the wrong one
well, no worries, because we can track what you are talking about without much problem
well, no, I always considered you highly aesthetic -- working code which you think is wrong fills you with deep pangs
well, no, all the warnings looked valid to me
well, no, it can't ..
well, no, it's been like all of five minutes.. i'll do it 2morrow first thing
well, no, it's that they need to allow my block in

well, not filed yet
well, not fixed
well, not gouged
well, not hard at least
well, not if it workd for you
well, not if one is not set :)
well, not if you have a new session
well, not important
well, not in 3.0
well, not in that order
well, not in theory to do the changes but it has to wind up there. dreamweaver seems to get uppity sometimes if you edit outside
well, not just gay
well, not just idiot, the morally dodgy...
well, not just that
well, not modifying package installs is a good start
well, not neccessarily i guess
well, not nuke, them, just return them
well, not perl
well, not quickly.  Ill put it in the stairwell
well, not quite...
well, not really
well, not really bloody
well, not really private, just off the subject of opus
well, not really sad...
well, not really, they could ship us the box or whatever
well, not really.

well, not relaly
well, not so black and white
well, not stuggling -- just waiting

well, on defmarc stuff I can't really comment
well, on irc
well, on pkg upgrade I would prefer to only upgrade when necessary
well, on some level don't you think our approach of well, if they don't like it they'll say somehting after I commit it is somewhet suboptimial?
well, on the bright side, if my call to all-dump-classes matches the order in which the call on umich server resturns symbols
well, on the head, it is updated in one of the deftransitions
well, on the merged bug sara reported it not working and listed where
well, on the up side of life, I finished the first draft of my screenplay last night
well, on usql all bets are off unless you applied the 186 thing to the branch
well, ona  box where I can't get ssh without having a special path, I'm not sure
well, once in a while anyway
well, once is enough
well, once we start digging in  on the 1.8 stuff we'll need a branch for 1.7 maint, but we can make that retroactively
well, one always has to put up with something, doesn't one?
well, one bug down
well, one has an org with oid 3, the other with oid 4

well, please me a long-distance call and ask them 
well, ppl tell me to lay off all the time
well, prep can still get there...
well, prep is production and shouldn't be used for testing anyhow, no?
well, prepare yourself.... sorry
well, presentations work on streams normally, so it just creats a string output stream.  The intent of that partiuclar use is to render the captions as Resource Locations as opposed to RESOURCE-LOCATIONS.
well, pressha anyway

well, really just Object as far as I can see
well, rebuilding the lisp
well, redhat already is using that
well, regarding unmilestoned bugs, I'm not really likely to be able to go over all unmilestoned bugs
well, regardless, it doesn't seem to like any of the passwords i'm putting in
well, regardless, we now have up to date documentation and a single function to reload the whole dataset, and a deeper unerstanding of your expectationswhen communicating via IRC!
well, relative to our assets and investment influx 8)
well, release notes won't be done
well, remember that it's not the purpose of 2.0.5 to fix all speed issues

well, she says she's not mad at me, but you know how that goes
well, she's from Misery but it's close enough
well, shit
well, shit is excrement
well, shit man
well, shit, marc21 has all this bogus catography support and such we don't care about
well, shocking eh?
well, should be easy to track down then
well, shouldn't you know who made the change, ask them to justify, and the nproceed?
well, since edit-reservation also uses store-isntance, and that uses validate-state, I'm wondering if what you're seeing is not just an inappropriate state change in the circulation screen as opposed to a real commit
well, since it can only generate fine type charges, it is an accurate label
well, since it works in std RH, we're not fixing it for free
well, since the data interchange was modelled on the data they gave us, then I think we're ok... well, I hope
well, since the editing context changes are not commited until after the response is rendered, webmethods that don't directly modify objects have to call it explicitely
well, since you're not cursed, in the interest of saving money  i guess you should do all the upgrades, huh?
well, sir, reporting in sir
well, skeletor is awol
well, sleep time
well, slid
well, slightly better than me
well, small problemo
well, smaller
well, so create evetns are not being migrated?  or created or what?
well, so if anybody has any ideas or leads, let us know
well, so it can be removed?  it's vestigal?
well, so long as deleting doesn't cause problems.
well, so long as it's humble
well, so much for SAIC installed by end of April
well, so much for my release deadlines, no way we can hit it
well, so much for testing blank instance
well, so now is good, what's up?
well, sojmeone can be student and employee I guess
well, soldier, you done good.
well, some fines are addedd to extant invoices.
well, some of it
well, some of it is define-indexes and there is some need to better process the args goin thru
well, some of them anyway
well, some part of your devel team may have to deal with it
well, somebody there has put a file on the chapman asp server
well, somebody's got to do it.
well, someday we'll let the users do the import themselves
well, someone in chicago would have to look at that
well, someone might want to fix the cron job thingie
well, someone needs to reboot playip3
well, someone needs to work on those
well, someone set up the ucla 3.1 demo instance
well, someone should buy some damn ram for gopher...
well, someone tell me what if anything to do to current saic instance; wait for 1.7.1 is perfectly acceptable
well, someone who wrote it might have a defense of that approach, I can't provide it myself
well, someone will never play in that town again
well, something broke it
well, something fell apart if I was supposed to know about it and act upon it
well, something has to do validation
well, something is seriously wrong then
well, something is sucking in connectivity.. are you getting lots of lag?
well, sometimes apply-auths shows 500
well, sometimes he's the port monkey
well, sometimes it will do it
well, sometimes that needs to be done, you know

well, sure, but who cares
well, sure. 
well, sure. I don't see any schema or data changes coming
well, sure...
well, surely they are closed by now
well, tag is laid
well, take it seriously... 
well, take it up with mgmt.
well, taking a resource offline checks for resource-conflicts, while bringing it online checks for schedule-status
well, talk to me about the benefits of this --
well, talk to me when you're done with that
well, tell her so I guess
well, tell me one more thing
well, tell us poly, how does it work?
well, terminal is not fully functional
well, test for that...
well, testing begins today
well, testing today
well, tests failed

well, thanks for the pointer to infobot
well, that and buy some giraffes
well, that bites
well, that can do it
well, that closes a P1 Blocker
well, that didn't kill it!
well, that dosn't imply you have a light workload
well, that eitehr poped up sine I ran migration, or it failed
well, that expalins all the dhcp traffic
well, that fixes 35 failing regression tests, I guess Im done fro the day
well, that image has some sort of problem.
well, that information is on the demo page of the support site.
well, that is correct
well, that is most recent
well, that is one thing, the search function is also not done
well, that is really an onshored phone number account.  Our account with Ameritech that we havn't had any phones on is paid up and fine
well, that is stilal bug, because it doesn't bump the byteArray size unless yu hit maximum
well, that is true
well, that is unclear debtor as person, vs a dept
well, that is what we had previously.  An atomic type with methods providing that direct mapping
well, that looks pretty good
well, that makes the iface simpler anyhow
well, that never lasts oes it
well, that postgres process isn't getting anywhere fast, i'm just going to waste the lisp process and reload
well, that seems like the alternative facing us
well, that seems more complicated than just doing one at depaul or iit
well, that settles it 8)
well, that shoudl shut him up
well, that should be surmountable
well, that sounds complicated and fierce
well, that suggests it resets the current allocation.  which is not entirely accurate
well, that sux, what good is music without Space HipHop
well, that time I had started a session
well, that too
well, that was actually eric's request
well, that was kinda cute
well, that was logging something else
well, that was what i was told
well, that wasn't exactly the line, was it?
well, that wasn't very clear, but maybe you know what I mean
well, that works actually
well, that works too 8)
well, that would be  a different  bug issue
well, that would be a pretty bad bug
well, that would be nice if I could actually edit kernel args
well, that would have been nice to know
well, that would require methods that specialize on those type specifiers, and that is not possible is it?
well, that' may be true :)
well, that's 'perl Makefile.pl'
well, that's a  perfectly valid reason for not calling
well, that's a bit tricky... fee stuff is already on the branch
well, that's a given
well, that's a good question .. somebody told me to put it in wcof-config.lisp
well, that's a point
well, that's all I have
well, that's almost appropriate given the uncertainty of the fall
well, that's another one
well, that's bad for downloaded stuff
well, that's because your close to don and I'm probably being a bit harsh this morning
well, that's consistent anyway
well, that's different
well, that's easy to test
well, that's funny
well, that's good.... If I don't get picked by Wednesday afternoon, I'm off scotch free
well, that's hardly a crippling problem
well, that's his problem
well, that's it 
well, that's it for what's there
well, that's needed for clc I think
well, that's neither here nor there nor true anymore I think
well, that's not bad actually
well, that's not critical theory necessarily
well, that's not entirely true.
well, that's not good
well, that's not my problem today, but yeah
well, that's not onshored's fault
well, that's not random
well, that's not really related
well, that's one
well, that's par for the course from you, so I thought nothing of it
well, that's partially true, but you'de need to get Isreal out of Palestine too
well, that's partly my fault I think
well, that's possible
well, that's possible. I'll add.
well, that's probably an audiophile needle
well, that's probably more detail than I'm going to get into the release notes.
well, that's probably true...
well, that's prolly a bit long IMO
well, that's really the pressing migraiton milestone, ucb testing of the new reports and such
well, that's the last time blink 182's site is going to crash my machine!
well, that's the look and feel Raul is going with, and at this state in the game, I'm not going to redo everything
well, that's the migration bug

well, that's tragic
well, that's what craig said at first too...
well, that's what i see in stack trace
well, that's what it is suposed to do, but apparently defquery has a bug
well, that's why FS signed with Ministry of Sound
well, that's why I said that's a good place to start, eh?
well, that's why we have a package
well, thats a bit of an exageration
well, thats a good thing
well, thats a total lie
well, thats good
well, thats good news
well, thats my word
well, thats not EXACLTY true
well, thats not what has happend up till now
well, thats one way to close all bugs on the milestone
well, thats the only ting i found a reference to at perl.com, still checking cpan, but what i have seen there seems to be Activeperl too. Let me look more

well, thats why you should hook me up with one of those 23 Cinema LCD displays

well, the deliver to on agreement form
well, the demo already has rsrcs
well, the demo is going to be running with the media feature on
well, the design decision I just described is quite low level and an implementation issue.  We perhaps could have avoided a waste of a day ro so if we had approached the design of the migration ina  more formal and communicative manner, but as of now, we're all pretty much on the same page with it
well, the docs are on umich
well, the ear pain I was having last week was awful, ears so stuffed up they hurt

well, the format I used for locations mirrors the new location schedule format
well, the format priority list, erm
well, the funtion takes a metadata class and checks for the two things I mentiond.

well, the identity between two actions whose object is clearly different seems rather semantic to me
well, the immediate problem is that we can't get to SAIC

well, the init script works as user or as root, woo
well, the instances were NOT out of date
well, the iris import does not do anything to turn them into rtypes

well, the office firewall realy only stops fragments and some spoofed addresses
well, the one from craig is love both of us
well, the ones that aren't working for al quaeda

well, the syntax is busted
well, the syntax is right

well, the terminology is kinda weak here
well, the thing is it depends on how clueless the person who did the initial import-file was
well, the thing is offline right?
well, the thing is that it's station and not printing.lisp that changed
well, the thing is, how do I get a copy of the frozen shit that I can edit, the frozen tag is not a branch
well, the title page bug and the xref bug
well, the updates were very minor
well, the use of testing 3.0 would be if there is a slight different config on one...

well, the whole framework seems like it is changable is all
well, the whole search screen is 120 lines

well, the writer I currently have is for the 51 family
well, their provider directoy lists a doctor who is no longer practicing...
well, then 
well, then I think he should 
well, then any of that stuff is run outside the rubrik of check-versinoning ?
well, then i already did it correctly
well, then ignore them when they complain
well, then its broken
well, then maybe not... it was just a vague feeling
well, then the problem is the user doesn't know if they are forbidden or if there is just a bug where we forgot to add the function
well, then we dont have to fix it.
well, then we have a profound restore speed problem
well, then why would it call label on it
well, then you are probably right...
well, then you're a big gay italian in New jersey
well, then!
well, ther eare two live lines there, one of which is the alarm pair
well, ther eis no such thing as log out, so that confused me a little

well, they an justlink in libgc nowadays
well, they approved it
well, they are a root for the tree...
well, they are all error msg bugs so they are ugly

well, they have good taste in software .. but that's about it
well, they have new data they want, so
well, they have ten zillion uncontained media resources
well, they just mark that the reports are too slow I think
well, they just went into production very recently...

well, they should be
well, they smell fine, but everythign around them smells bad
well, they tarred up some files, but not all of the Oracle installation
well, they used to be there, as an estimate based on the length of the checkout. I thought it was useful to be able to tell patrons approx. how much it was going to cost up front.
well, they were a plate, a toenail clipper and the keyboard of my laptop
well, they were asleep or something
well, they were updated with their own data last week at the same time beta so I don't know what the deal is, maybe it's cause of the migration?
well, they will probably fill up again, no?
well, they'll all be using the marc format for their local needs --lots of standardation but lots of uniqueness too.
well, they're asking us to do that...
well, they're going to start testing the applets on tuesday, so make sure you get it all wrpped up by friday, 3pm, say?
well, they're going to tighten up laundering
well, they're looking to deploy to more depts...

well, to recap on Media....
well, to start with, 90% solution, right?
well, to the customer I will :)
well, tomarry
well, tommorow is when me and lee rack our beer
well, top level with no subtypes is just an out and out bug I believe
well, true
well, true enough
well, try 'make test' in production
well, try it
well, try it in lisp-src
well, try jk
well, trying migration yet again
well, two
well, two days, not so much
well, two of the passwords I tried do
well, two weeks may be about right
well, ucb hasn't produced an error, yet.  maybe you'll get them.
well, ucb is indeed 2.0.10, projex now accurate
well, uffi is not the issue of replacing drivers, unless I'm confused
well, uh, burrito is my pentium... 
well, uh, uh um ok
well, uh, we can just break^d^d^d^d^dfix the data

well, um ... that begs th question what is the sexy payoff from the Dirty Sanchez?
well, um, I've been to the doctor once in maybe 10 years
well, um, my friend...
well, um...
well, unless they are supposed to do it
well, unless you want to allow indefinite lossage, yet.
well, until tomorrw I think
well, update and it's fixed
well, upgrade-wco-instance -d wcodemo  should do it and reload demo data set
well, upset is a streach.... impatient
well, usc is all the way down and I need to get them back up
well, usually, people ignore sigpipe

well, waht is lunch
well, wait a minnit... 
well, wait a sec then
well, wait, is this fourth grade again?
well, wait, it was supposed to
well, wait, no my bad
well, wait, that makes sense, there are lots of alloc data which is not temporal related
well, wait...
well, was going to get rid of that compiler error, but not going to bother now, thought it was justa simple ordering issue, so I'm just gonna go back to hitting P1s now
well, wati
well, wco is #1
well, wco-announce email isn't a lot
well, wco-beta back up
well, wco-beta is on the head now
well, wcof-delete is perhaps failing in the middle... you can trace it and see if it gets called
well, wdd is more like a fictional user
well, we *were* complaining about extra processes ;)
well, we always do wind up logging in for whatever reason
well, we an figure out what is going on, whih is a bug, not alieness, or you can restart
well, we are at 91k records and counting.
well, we are dropping the db.. it's not necessary
well, we are getting by
well, we are passed the resource-temporal hurdle
well, we both had that issue with the define-query-page form at the top when we loaded
well, we can cover that sort of thing with a de-dupe function
well, we can do it in wco-framework-tests
well, we can handle it mahaully, you're right
well, we can have them by monday
well, we can implement an Elephant2k interpretor and runtime in lisp
well, we can just have it default to closing time or noon for the day and only allow specification of new day in the status bar
well, we can put up a blank 2.0 instance if you want
well, we can roll it out tonight, no?
well, we can talk about it tommorow, I'll let you make the call about the release if you want.
well, we can throw away everything we have done....
well, we could also track webmethod invocations in the session
well, we could do clipping also?
well, we could get some beers and chill, or we could go some place
well, we could probalby just set the fine separated flag to the or of fines or fee rules that are set there and be about right
well, we could say wco holds have to be updated in wco
well, we could spend our limited $$ on a new RH box but I would rather not...
well, we could switch it and then look to see where we get doubles
well, we could use the incident notion
well, we decided to go with the web proxy kerb thing, the easy one -- you might take a look at that for any gotchas that you think I need to work out in spec
well, we did a total rework of the facet stuff into a better system
well, we did say no more redesign in 3.0 mainline
well, we do have them, but 1. we never went over all code as such and 2. we had total misconceptions about the Foundation Ownership Policy.
well, we do now if we used the currency input

well, wheaton says they are down right now
well, when I first started exploring the Invoice interface, I thought the way to Waive the entire invoide was to select all, and click Waive Selected.
well, when I pulled out the other wide cable, then it wouldn't even boot
well, when edting a person it wouldbe usefulto get a list o orgaizations they are employed by
well, when he awakes he will be treated to a coffee yah, and that will cheer anyone up
well, when he dikd this CD it was Fingaz
well, when i opened the email there was this little quicktimey like window in the bottom of the email
well, when is the next m-th flight with a reasonable price on it?
well, when the instance gets restarted oracle needs to be restarted
well, when the metadata is altered, one should probably clrhash the 'metadata slot on the corresponding object
well, when they hit the commit button in the applet, what button do they then use to pick it up?

well, whenever tonite
well, where I am, it's a nice sunny day
well, where is wget in patH?
well, where were you accused of such things?
well, which one is it?
well, while im on the branch I will clear up any other minor bugs that come to light
well, while your on it...
well, who broke it?
well, who can argue with charming excellencies!
well, who knows
well, who wants to write java, not I 8)
well, whois our laison to the HTML production team?
well, why are you bothering checking?
well, why can't there be a rhetorical reply?
well, why didn't you tell me?
well, why do I need the format index working?
well, why do we *care* to capture that?
well, why do we need it in both the system log and the allocation log?  if the report can read the allocation log, isn't that sufficient?
well, why do you propose it? cheapness?
well, why don't they change their stupid menu?
well, why is it in TODO then?
well, why would a standard method bomi NOT be a keyword like all the ther standard method combis?
well, with DSL
well, with a little effort, you can at least make it readable, if not brief
well, with a locally hacked wco-framework, I get:
well, with dhcp it does
well, with the circulator it will not be updated since there is no calls to redraw status
well, without a disable button, setting theIP to nil, or empty seems the most obvious way of doing what I described
well, without a milestone, how do we know it's ready for release :)
well, without more empirical profiling analytic, nothing can be considered
well, without my instance on there I will be unable to work, so like we better put it back
well, works for me
well, would a fetaure freeze include a hold on rewrites without peer review?
well, would last nights be all that different from this mornings?
well, wouldn't be the first time
well, ya never can tell, cause noone optimizes these things for sparc linux
well, yah is slooshy
well, yah, we need to get all the tests green too of course
well, yah, who does
well, yah... I never understood the distinction... is squarepushr drill-n-base ?
well, yaknow, part 1
well, yank it and see if anything breaks, that's the Xtreme Programming Way!
well, yeah
well, yeah but nevermind
well, yeah, but I was referring more to the collection of geek books: Cryptonomicon, Neuromancer, stuff of that ilk
well, yeah, yeah, whatever
well, yeah... that interfaces file looks like it should work but i've never used it.
well, yer lucky then :)
well, yes
well, yes and no

well, yes, i mean relative to docroot
well, yes, of course it's nice
well, yes, that woudl be a good thing
well, yes, they are kinda lame
well, yesterday actually
well, you *did* file a bug about it
well, you all deal with your boss more often and more openly than at any most any other company
well, you and lefty work it out then
well, you are fetching twice... try getting the users hash and then op onm that to get first and last name
well, you are making up for that now
well, you are ready to hack eh?
well, you asked which version I was working with
well, you asked, so-- a lot
well, you backed up first, so no worries, right?
well, you basically will want to find the docbook DSSSL stylesheet definiton which produces that, and then you'll have to hack on it
well, you blame difficult fit and works for everyone else 
well, you can
well, you can allot time for me to do more investigation, or you can help me get a new box to replace the G3
well, you can always shove it into a corner of hte basement until you feel like working on a project @:)
well, you can bother if you want
well, you can do it to try it but we'll have to clean it up later
well, you can download the trial version. thats good for 30 days
well, you can fix that right?
well, you can fuck with your sounds in a text editor...
well, you can hardly say identical
well, you can load the file that way but it has to be like the last thing that happens
well, you can max it at once a day if you like
well, you can normally tab between HTML form elements no?
well, you can roll back if you want
well, you can see with how I did the import dcumentation on how repeated bits of text can be made into entities
well, you can write your own constructor to do that
well, you can't sort by date!
well, you can...
well, you could argue that i am more underground
well, you could have an account-code type in such cases
well, you could have the rtype list as a mutli-select list box
well, you could just pass in a different map
well, you could still check *features* at runtime actually
well, you could use adam@alpha perhaps
well, you could use it if you actually properly references it
well, you do know that the current date is the 30th for it, don't you?
well, you don't think our best and brightest are going to take jobs as security guys do you?
well, you filed two but one was de-duped
well, you get cascading failure...
well, you go boy!
well, you got a fresh new woody box
well, you got something
well, you have a two-pixel border around the window -- you can make that different colors
well, you have one search engine... but it has two modes it operates in:  overall, and the specific stuff
well, you have quicker command over the pakage and autconf than I do.  I can handle it prolly
well, you have to know the app to get the bugs I want...
well, you have to leave the case off doze, and sometimes it will turn it self off 
well, you have to put something in the 'manditory' fields
well, you have vaction in 2 weeks no?
well, you know it's gonna be
well, you know the quick quick fix right?
well, you know tinderbox results aren't real-time
well, you know you could cache that
well, you know, framework testing coverage!
well, you know, slutface
well, you know, they spend all that money
well, you let me know if you change your mind
well, you liked my J is for apple at least
well, you looked more like my roommate
well, you make the call.
well, you may have a point there...
well, you might be interested in 3579
well, you might have been directing that at jesse not me
well, you might have to grab ayres
well, you might have to hack it
well, you might try pulling the cards out for now
well, you might wanna file the syr stuff as a 2.0.11 bug
well, you must make that so.. is it there?
well, you never know
well, you never mentioned it
well, you probably should not have eaten it, duh
well, you probably shouldn't use undocumented stuff anyway?  or you have to?
well, you put the windowing system in the kernel, you get what you deserve.
well, you run code you don't read?
well, you said it, not me.
well, you said you had starred what you think we need to fill in...
well, you see adam, the database still has all of that stuff when I access it thru the class mechanism as well
well, you should include docstrings in that count too
well, you should put some up for sale there then :)
well, you should put that in there
well, you should reply telling them to please remove any duplicated copies of programs
well, you think I should have a phase 2 implementation category and plop it down there?
well, you try make freeze in your homedir and see if it stays
well, you wanna just run up the DSL on a seperate cable as a contingency?
well, you want me to file or no?
well, you want some fixes 8)
well, you were at SPSS then I believe
well, you were certainly right yesterday
well, you were trying to renew a returned checkout
well, you were trying to renew a returned reservation
well, you wont get multiple machines on there
well, you'd have to tell me how much of a priority that is
well, you'r browser is broken, boyo
well, you're anti-theoretical
well, you're not an addict
well, you're support guy
well, you're working from home, not missing work are you?
well, you've been talking about the slowness, most of last night and this morning
well, your manager can buy books for ya if we don't already have them
well, your work these last two weeks has really been great
well, yow is zippy!
well, yummy is the taste of pork roll egg and cheese on a kaiser bun
well, zaire is .ZR
well, zenirc does that too
well,...
well,....
well,; lets leave it for now
well,I have no idea what to tell you guys
well,I would imagine is returns like a alloc-contents-summary type object that has a render-html elsewhere defined?
well,i don't remember
well,if they are reaped and then transaction stupidity occurs, perhaps
well,it owuld only be nonexisting if the logs are purged totally, something which we have never done
well,l I can check
well,ok then 8)
well,only4 moremajor revisions to go until we're perfect
well,the whole skip issue is basically a big flaw with the whole system
well-tempered synth ?
well.
well.  it's just potentially many to many
well. We could have the clicking on the boxes simply add all the defaults to the list and then the user can remove those they dont want
well. literally it means so-called
well. lunch time
well. you understand
well..
well.. I'm sure we can ask for whatever time we want
well.. actually... Hmm...
well.. preheat is almost unusable due to this sorta shit...
well.. the utexas default criteria for find media seems  to be gone
well..!
well...
well... 
well... *some* stuff should be there... i.e., the autoloads
well... ?
well... I could be wrong
well... I could run that tonight when its late and quiet and report results
well... I didnt' really spec that per se
well... I don't think that wuold break anything, just annoy users when suddenly TIFFs are huge...
well... I hope not
well... I sent it about 30 mins ago
well... I would like to get that mirror back in action whatever it takes please
well... I'm open to more elegant solutions
well... by all means, set inactive then
well... did anyone get me pricing?
well... from a usability standpoint no
well... hope this is the last time it's like this before release...
well... i can tell you what the router is
well... i'm gonna take a stab at this first
well... is doesn't like letters or big numbers for time codes...
well... is there any way to get the lisp build to exit on failure?
well... let me take a look at it... too bad there's not a pkg... installing stuff on servers where there is no pkg very very often is a nightmare in the long term
well... lets try to get the fields right...
well... maybe cbl can back you up -- if you forget, he does it...
well... maybe that's overstating it a bit
well... maybe; iv'e never seen any breakdown of what was using the most bandwith at onshore... i was hoping to get a firewall in and analize the traffic better... 'cause the stats off the cisco are too boring
well... not, not just as I wish...
well... our clue is the multiple warp packets
well... someone better call them or something then
well... the intellectual atmoshere here at onShore IS intoxicating
well... the link was created by 'make install' done under cvs
well... there is one thing i changed that i should test further....
well... they are corporate america
well... they're just brining it inline with sql stds I believe
well... who is going to mediate it?
well... yeah
well... you will have me bug repoerts tomorrow morning 
well...!
well....
well.... can you briefly clue me on what is blocking display of media?
well.... dude it's getting late...
well.... since onShore's internet traffic is low and not apt to grow, perhaps it is the right move.
well....why not?
well...;
well...i don't know
well...let's see.......
well...what do you mean jeff?
well...where..?
well..;
well..well...
well..what are we waiting for!
well?

what I am asking is, who added the code there that draws that box?
what I am denying is your hair brained reasoning about the problem stemming from your total lack of having read the code
what I am workign on now is the UCB Acct-code -> dept list script
what I am workign with right now is a sort of pseudo-property
what I be-u-ti-ful day it is here
what I did was disallow the taking offline of a resource with a pending allocation
what I did was just ride up and down all the streets in the hood looking for signs, read them all, and if it was good, called them right there on my cellphone
what I did was put the cal to generate it inside the unwind protect that has the destroy-comp-table as it's second clause
what I do care about is that the other fields mentioned there do appear
what I do is descrypt passes.gpg, load passes in an emacs buffer, set read only, then remove passes on disk
what I do is:
what I don't get is that if all these sales keep rolling in, why are we still broke )sorry inf uncouth query)
what I have heard so far is quite enjoyable
what I heard was pretty conventional get the floor dancin' stuff
what I just pasted in:
what I like about Richard Stallman is that he controls every interview he is ever in
what I likes about lisp is that it goes up fast and takes much fer lines of code
what I mean by checkbox is that like on the allocation commit screen a checkbox for Send email notice? Send reminder prior to pickup?
what I mean is an IMHO page
what I mean is that, if we had never worked with them before, we might give them an estimate based on the assumption that they could hand us the specs for the unspeced items by april 7 along with the other content
what I meanis, the with-wco-session appears outside of the framework method
what I need is a new monitor and a new desktop
what I quoted is for the latter...
what I really want are migrated fines
what I said
what I said above is easy, and I was hoping was a satisfactory implementation.. should I just do that?
what I said befure... you were going to give some recommendations on things needing testing to the beta list
what I said over 'der
what I see in annotate is the head?
what I see is:
what I think we should focus on drafting the presentation type system and the rendering protocol
what I usually do is generate an ssh key wit an empty password, and then move then to the cafe and put it in the authorized_key file in he .ssh directory
what I wanna do is confirm packats are going thru it properly when next I see a hang
what I was going to do was to iterate from 0->sequence for fsdb-map
what I was pissy about was the change to pin-psheet button rendering
what I will try is, hit Thai SC if open, otherwise Bul Go Ki
what I would like to do is create a temporary table with an explicit sequence number according to a select
what I would suggest is translating this format into MARC 8)
what I'm asking is, then howis the rest of the record forthat person fleshed out?
what I'm calling cache cohernecy is more like data integrity
what I'm not happy about comes down to just this:
what I'm trying to get at is the change in the ontology of a set allocation
what I'm worried about: is it going to take another 2 weeks to get to a decent semblance of beta quality?  6 weeks?
what NAMM is all about the analog now?

what we SHOULD have done,a nd what you can do, is not have the auto-circ thingee run
what we are doing
what we are trying to do is decouple the generation of events and their handling.  There is no reason they cant happen in the same transaction
what we are using is the raw ordering of that list now
what we can do is either add an optional argument to output-sql which can be a type specifier, or we can just require that boolean slots have a :db-writer options that converts nil to f and t to t
what we didn't know was how far 2.0 bugfix would stretch out
what we do apart from sticking that crud in sql or whatnot is totally disjunct
what we do for saic for instance
what we do with the systems we write is that we have the system definition load a local configuration fileif it exists, after  
what we don't use we can sell to keep the business going
what we doooo need...
what we need is an all purpose expletive
what we need to do is junk alpha and replace it with a decent server
what we need to do is tape the camera to the center of the monitor
what we need to spec is the capability or lack of capabi8lity vs the current data
what we use is comma-separated, quoted
what we want I think is a snapshot, something very very close to what pg_dump was giving us
what we want is TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE -- but what are the set of possible things we *don't* want?
what we would be usin DOM for, simple manipulation of a webpage ina browser for presentation purposes, is much different, and the limitations I see are eclipsed by the limitations of javascript and java in that environment

what you need
what you need is a little desk moving exercise
what you need to do is 'serve-an-event
what you need to do is have little bits i nthe individual reference sections, e.g., on reservation confirmation, there should be a little comment Note: this feature is only available if you have email messaging enabled.  The send email button will send a reservation reminder to the patron, containing information about th reservation, blah.
what you need to do is modify find-entity-page
what you need to do is move the file to the proper directory;
what you need, new kernel install?
what you need?

what you would want to do is drag the wco_release_3_0_1 and frozen tags to the head of those modules
what you write in
what you're proposing
what you're talking about there is not so much stress testing as making sure we have accurate coverage of the code in the testing phase

whether he committed it is a different story...

whether it's 10.1 or 11 or 11.1 or 12 
whether it's a sticky tag or not is irrelevant

yah gotcha
yah had some ginger
yah he does that
yah he featured some nice technique... 
yah he is
yah he might take a week to get the hang of webco but he has experience testing 
yah he popped in  a bit ago
yah he split
yah he wants a cd
yah he works upon that
yah he's a couple miles away
yah hold on
yah i agree
yah i bet
yah i can dig it
yah i can't reconnect from skeletor either

yah i think he was the narrator
yah i think it's gut
yah i think it's ok
yah i think so
yah i think so ... i haven't tried it yet
yah i think the java isn't requesting schedules
yah i thought so
yah i told them
yah i understand
yah i was able to deal using a combination of gnumeric and excel
yah i was just about to ask where he got it...
yah i was thinking that might be a good idea
yah i would think with all the lime from the cement and stuff that wouldn't be too much of a prob
yah i'll be back in a few minutes ...

yah, I really don't need anything more done for monday, gracchus
yah, I rebooted, forgot
yah, I recall seeing both running

yah, I see your point, hmm
yah, I sent hours to webco-devel and vacation stuff to staff
yah, I should do courier, no brainer
yah, I should follow up on this
yah, I should make those into requirements
yah, I should read up on that... anyhow, forging ahed
yah, I shouldn't get too distracted... 
yah, I spaced on the wcodemo@prep problem
yah, I sped it up the other day
yah, I spent a lot of time cold-calling last week, and I think I need to get a little more focused before expending more of that kind of energy.
yah, I ssh into sp to get my email
yah, I stopped for goodies on the way in
yah, I take it they are getting thru some other company right?
yah, I talked to it for awhile, but it's nota good listener and not willing to compromise
yah, I talked to josh about it already
yah, I thin kthat would be best
yah, I think 2798 is fine as is, I'll check that
yah, I think I'll try website.dtd
yah, I think he has every 101 Strings album
yah, I think it's off their newest album
yah, I think so
yah, I think that is what it will be
yah, I think, and this shows how lon ago it wasI did perl, your substituting $_ which is a differnet set of chars, a copy, o that line in the $page scalar.
yah, I thinkt hat's best
yah, I thinkt he indexes are the only part dangling right now, and I'm sewing them up

yah, I was reviewing the 2.4.x kernel logs yesterday
yah, I was telling jesse that I want to freeze the framework near the end of the week, tommoow or Friday, and havea good close review of it done by all of us
yah, I was thinking of applying there back in the day
yah, I wish I couldhave the support personel do that
yah, I wish we had a test suite agressive enough to stop this crap from happening
yah, I would gu7ess not
yah, I would have thought so
yah, I would like to talk to you a bit about what it would do and how it would operate
yah, I would wager
yah, I wouldn't mind
yah, I'll add that as a baseline charge to the first item
yah, I'll do that
yah, I'll handle the mail archive shit, I got root already
yah, I'll just be consistent in current implementation and we can change later.
yah, I'll just branch it
yah, I'll take that bug
yah, I'm a lucky stiff
yah, I'm actually saic@alpha
yah, I'm confused on purpose.
yah, I'm debating when o do it
yah, I'm done
yah, I'm feeling prett good.  Just my neck is soe as hell from sleeping all day yesterday
yah, I'm gonna draw uip the changes and me and jesse will review them
yah, I'm happy 8)
yah, I'm hoping to get to my doc bugs later...
yah, I'm not going to put on more than 1 person
yah, I'm not going to today
yah, I'm not saying we should release it today
yah, I'm not sure whatwould work best with view-classes.
yah, I'm not trhying to use it to form a judgement about him
yah, I'm on the phone now, but I need to look at the release notes and figure out where my testing needs to be directed
yah, I'm still rough, it's been a week, I'm still sick
yah, I'm sure
yah, I'm sure I deserve it... sorry
yah, I'm sure THAT will work
yah, I'm there, looks fine
yah, I'm trying to break myself of my overdesign over-verbose habits
yah, I'm worries about the migration
yah, I've alrady explained that one a few times
yah, I've been really trying to focus.
yah, I've been testying on saic,k but got some more to do there
yah, I've done that before
yah, I've had it workin for awhile 8)
yah, I've hit that b4 too
yah, I've read the MOP book
yah, I've read the courtney one
yah, I've seen that.. that's what I was just looking into
yah, II read that in scrollback
yah, IP is definately evil
yah, IRC cannot lie
yah, Java burn
yah, John Loder has a bunch of good places to look
yah, LIJOS goes back and forth I think
yah, NFS spools would kick your ass, so error prone
yah, NY fads arrive in chi about 6 months later
yah, SNMP
yah, X is hard
yah, a - is in front of everything
yah, a big shared emacs
yah, a cross between unpleased and nonplussed
yah, a fucking 40 foot wave can easily kill
yah, a litle bit.
yah, a little slow and recluse, but good rest
yah, a lot of the freelance jobs I've been seeing are ecommerce for porn sites, even here in ny
yah, a poo sheilded server, all unused ports physically removed too
yah, a week in purgatory
yah, about what?
yah, absolutely
yah, according to JC
yah, according to the doec eoDescription on the user should show us wether or not there are any relations
yah, acroread does it
yah, actually, I do
yah, actually, I'm impressed
yah, actually, it's gone!!
yah, actually, that would be good
yah, adam and craig own my .gnus file :)
yah, adam forgot to recompile java when he updated
yah, add an invoice would be annoying
yah, agreed
yah, aka ama ebi
yah, all I see is adam's output from the scheduler-integrity check, it loading and running alloc-rules and then more requests
yah, all I'm talkinga bout doing is saying this symbol is recognized as a valid merit token, and it's description is this string
yah, all of baylor could be cotained in one file easily enough
yah, alloc caches and EC caches would get confuzled
yah, alloc-status is busted
yah, almost got it working
yah, alpha
yah, already a bug for that
yah, always a good idea
yah, amateur surgery is always funny
yah, an't wait for mozilla to finish upand kill em both
yah, and Power Politics and a bunch of other stuff
yah, and badmouth people that write free software
yah, and being a downtrodden black man, I will make you pay at every turn
yah, and checking out CLtL2 section on conditions and debugging is useful too
yah, and da gooey gooey gumdrops
yah, and elsewhere ... filing
yah, and everyone's always trying to get josh laid
yah, and from what I've seen so far it will actually close bugz, in particular the mod_webapp reload stuff
yah, and furry all over to keep them warm
yah, and grow the current static dhcp range
yah, and it will never read past buflen
yah, and it's all functiona application, in that sense all of our protocols are the same
yah, and lewes is installing a new transformer tonite so power to the whole town is out from midnight to 8am tommorow
yah, and perhaps our vulture lackies in the N.Alliance are going to be able to spend the next two months getting their heads handed to them
yah, and returns it
yah, and since it's not pulling one randomly from the DB, it is not like one can argue that the increased variability of data going intot he test would provide better coverage
yah, and smoky as all get out
yah, and software too
yah, and that costs more money.
yah, and that is why you go to the find rtype screen, to select the rtype to set the parent to
yah, and that's not the FW
yah, and the airwolf
yah, and the fine and fee gneeration with them
yah, and the nitpicky shit is a good sign, it means they are groveling for flaws
yah, and the point is?
yah, and the worst jazz collection
yah, and then I need to be able to strip args out so like :circulating nil doesn't generate an [:equal :circlation NIL]
yah, and then we still have a considerable bit of work to do
yah, and then you could be famous and sell out in 6 months
yah, and there is an implied relationship between the people as well
yah, and we can afford to have more detail in our interface
yah, and when making authorizations for students, you would want a list, or the ability to define a new one easily
yah, and you are not runnigna mobile chip
yah, and you can no chain propert references
yah, announce sent...
yah, another fire on humboldt too
yah, anyhow
yah, anything in the 1.8 line is off the branch
yah, apparently it's was way simple, and there doesn't seem to b ea way to get the damn cat back in the bag
yah, are we waiting for the release on thrusday for that or not?
yah, are you doin BLT too?
yah, as I said, let's just do what's right
yah, as he should
yah, as in they don't get lunchables.
yah, as long as someone is doing it...
yah, as well as our race
yah, as well as quit eafew more mid-range people
yah, assert-admin did it
yah, astrology is meaningless
yah, at YoYo Laundry, they do good work
yah, at civic opera house
yah, at least not on my installation
yah, ause you gave new arguments in order to install webmin eh?
yah, autocirc is hosed afaict
yah, autoporn
yah, babu is supposed to be pretty amazing haven't heard much of his stuff
yah, back in the day
yah, back it out 
yah, basially 8)
yah, basically everything but IMHO should be re-released
yah, basically same aqui
yah, because I never go ta chance to work on it because we tore the search stuff up
yah, because it's arbitrary
yah, because resource-status is blowing chunks
yah, because that is what all editing would effect, physical-location is only populated during circulation
yah, because when you merge the branch back to the trunk you might get conflict city
yah, been back for awhile
yah, before they open
yah, being how essential he is
yah, beta needs upgrade tonight
yah, better
yah, better to use the latest if we are making any mods
yah, betterevery day
yah, big project I was asked to bid on
yah, bigloo is a bith
yah, billable
yah, bizzaro
yah, blah
yah, blame the person who submitted the site Friday at noon
yah, bleed at the edge baby
yah, blissfully
yah, book from 90's about history of car culture, written by an architecture critique
yah, boris is on the head
yah, branch is a good idea
yah, branch merge...
yah, bug config.status --recheck breaks
yah, build clean first
yah, but I thought this was a second one
yah, but I told craig I'd be around for the media stuff if he needs to talk
yah, but I was tearing that DB up a bit he just hit it at the wrong itme
yah, but MJ wasn't
yah, but _you_ aren't on leave
yah, but all that's nothing compared to trying to finesse 
yah, but currently you'd have to restart the server -- probably OK if you're running dpkg-reconfigure
yah, but dan needs the laptop ready to rock by 5
yah, but does deftype Do The Right Thing w.r.t. the db?
yah, but even SGML gives me the willies 8)  Well at least this week it does
yah, but how does that differe froma javamethod that is declared to throw no exceptions?
yah, but how we can be sure it will be smoother in the future, you know?
yah, but i you look at the available restarts, you an tell it to export them anyways
yah, but if you wanted to show someone what you saw on a web page, isn't sending them the html the way to go?
yah, but it costs us money
yah, but it doesn't sound as good
yah, but it rings forever before getting forwarded
yah, but it was made awhile ago
yah, but it's a boog that it's locking up all our devel instances when there is a bug
yah, but it's blowing out, not in...
yah, but it's bunk
yah, but it's important for identifying bugs that are reported on beta that were fixed already
yah, but it's not our fault that was pushed back
yah, but it's still fucking up
yah, but jsut getting ready to do some chores
yah, but load his data on alpha or do it on his box
yah, but not til it reboots ;)
yah, but same day as a fine-period has no well-defined meaning
yah, but that doesn't tell me much :)
yah, but that's all done as of tuesday right?
yah, but that's bad
yah, but that's two weeks I'm out
yah, but the HTML needed to soothe the table rendered in netscape into behaving as we want it, won't come from XHTML, because often it requires brokenness
yah, but the MC loc is right 8)
yah, but the allocation has no state at the point
yah, but the best way to close bugs is to send email to XXXX-done@bugs.debian.org, XXXXY-done@bugs.debian.org, etc with the body a description of why the bug is closed
yah, but they don't have any real spring in the keys
yah, but they don't know what they are gonna get before they commit then, and that's lame
yah, but this is pcmcia
yah, but virtuosity has drawbacks
yah, but what are you trying to do?
yah, but what days were they?
yah, but when i started doing tech support, i had to constantly call users back because i didn't know feature x
yah, but whenever I upload to alpha, there's already an announcement to webco-devel
yah, but where did it fail exactly
yah, but with ass kissing and hand holding
yah, but you tore me a new bunghole last time there was an ilisp bug right before release
yah, but you voted in Illinois
yah, but you're just talking about the scene
yah, but you're right
yah, but you're running slightly older code, so I am thinking it's changed on head
yah, but your rebuilding from scratch
yah, by Unisys.
yah, by virtual property I meant IP and brand.
yah, call CEO should be 200% hie
yah, call now pls
yah, came back in
yah, can fix that in CSS
yah, can you get me tix?
yah, can't argue with steele -- I'm too quikc to assume its our bug, just like josh
yah, can't blame him
yah, can't see the bug
yah, cats dig brains
yah, cause right now you logging into any onshore machines is giving that fucker an account
yah, cause they were checked out
yah, cause you had bib entries for serials, but each component of the serial would be a holding entry
yah, certain form-oriented stuff doesn't work i guess
yah, check it out some day when you're bored
yah, checking that. i assumed that was for fonts for some reasoin
yah, circulation policy is returning the fine-rate for :other instead of for :faculty
yah, clean will invoke preheat
yah, clearly those problems still exist
yah, clueless on that
yah, come get an i mac
yah, come on, keep spending!
yah, come to think of it
yah, concur
yah, confirmed
yah, confuses the mooks
yah, considering the change we just did, that was maybe two hours work
yah, copy it all eh
yah, could be
yah, could you :)
yah, craig and mary are eloping
yah, craig did some good wacking today
yah, craig is correct, darn
yah, craigl, run the import again and if it works with the old cache size, close it
yah, crashes for me
yah, customer upset
yah, dad might be having a bypass
yah, dag and craig are here
yah, damn good
yah, dan is a little wacky sometimes
yah, dan seems to be getting this whole i'm in charge attitude that needs to be simma'd
yah, dan sucks with email
yah, dan, how did you get that frat towel anyhow?
yah, dd would work
yah, decades of famine and war tend to do that 8)
yah, definately
yah, definately not a display issue
yah, definitely
yah, demo seems to be going fine for me too
yah, demo.webcheckout.net is missing that button
yah, denver, sure
yah, depends on which one of those, that determines which one of us sucks
yah, did you see my usql hackage?
yah, ditch the zero and get with a hero
yah, do that
yah, do that first then check back with me pls
yah, do that please josh
yah, do the full on uppdate-to-frozen -r wco_release_2_0_3
yah, do your support chores
yah, doesn't like weeks perhaps
yah, don't
yah, don't blame me baby
yah, don't do that
yah, don't do that too much, had a few close calls.  But short cuts, and popping up onto curbs, and threading between cars
yah, don't go as far as in that article
yah, don't see any commits recently... ?
yah, don't share your torment
yah, don't slack on that
yah, done
yah, double the problem spots
yah, dude, I am outtie in like 2 hours, not around tomorrow, and still have like 4 hours of release notes work to do
yah, dude, like I said, saw the show, like, in person
yah, dude, migrate everything they got
yah, dude, picking by rtype, it's totally bizarre what it gives me
yah, dude, read the release notes
yah, dude, run pure woody
yah, dude, trout-suit
yah, dude, wallstreet in the house
yah, dude...
yah, dutr, it's unbearable
yah, easy enough
yah, edgy gentle giant
yah, editing get's dificult
yah, effectively
yah, either one works
yah, email
yah, especially sincehe had to hang with those guys all the time
yah, especially the babys in the air-tight ziplock bags.  I hated leaning out the ones on the bottom o the pile that had been there for a few weeks
yah, essentially
yah, evidently
yah, exact
yah, exactly
yah, except for doing some marketing research, I took the weekend off
yah, except strign theory most boring to work with
yah, excised an method
yah, expand-regime
yah, file against the debian pkg... let me see the version...
yah, finishing up bfast now
yah, fits our usage pattern of it fine
yah, fix the internal.gpg file too pls
yah, flash it and see
yah, for 200 bux and some food, to bag on some java dorkz witha an MD recorder
yah, for Ram pricing
yah, for VF
yah, for ages
yah, for bandwidth too
yah, for linux
yah, for real
yah, for sure
yah, for the buttons
yah, for unserialized stuff
yah, forgot about that...
yah, frame I think of as the environment frame around a closure or something
yah, fro back in the day
yah, fuck intraday, I'm really convinced it's the wrong way to do it
yah, fuckwads!
yah, genau
yah, get some work done
yah, gimme a minit tho
yah, give it 10 mins
yah, give that a whirl
yah, glad we got an adam and not a manager
yah, glad we have your reassurance
yah, go for it
yah, god knows how
yah, goin out to Sonora to visit Julia's fam today
yah, goldchains and kid606 at the knitting factory
yah, good
yah, good excuse punk
yah, good guess
yah, good idea
yah, good idea!
yah, good idea, open a bug report, follow up
yah, good luck out there...
yah, good progress
yah, got it
yah, got that
yah, gotta have the flaming dragon
yah, gotta make sure the test-avl is loaded
yah, guess not
yah, harumph is mor like indignance
yah, hat is what I just set up, since I'm on this laptop now
yah, hate that shit
yah, have pro-rate and round-up options 8)
yah, have you heard This Heat?
yah, he brought it up on friday
yah, he did
yah, he finally got that published
yah, he got that idea from casey and peanuts
yah, he has a local-time type, so if we can get that code with a compatible license, we can use his stuf and then we can define a output-sql method specializing on that type and thebackend DB to convert it to the DBnative date format
yah, he installed some patches and it nuked the kernel
yah, he is
yah, he is british pop darling 
yah, he is giving a talk tonight, was thinking of going
yah, he is looking for work
yah, he is...
yah, he should useregular netscape perhaps
yah, he sits exactly six feet behind me, i can't help but monitor :)
yah, he told me not to worry about changes on surface
yah, he's 20
yah, he's a machine
yah, he's afro-american
yah, he's been hanging around there alot
yah, he's gone above and beyond with that one - these dam academics are terrible in that respect
yah, he's rocking with fela on this CD
yah, he's the   Head, Film and Video Library
yah, heard about that
yah, hell of a flight home too
yah, hence the dude :)
yah, herms
yah, his bug closure count is down
yah, hmm
yah, hold on, filing repair bug
yah, hold on...
yah, hook me up with one of those drag queens dutr!
yah, how about just not editable after an invoice has been made
yah, how do you maintain order?  By sitting in Europe and asking peopel to play nice?
yah, how so?
yah, huh
yah, huh, not sure...
yah, i agree that it was the best decision for apple to make given the circumstances
yah, i am learning how to make sql join
yah, i can access prep.onshored.com
yah, i didn't think so
yah, i dodny know it was such a popular place for newly weds - my girlfriend probably thought i was going to propose or something
yah, i don't know if he's there now
yah, i don't think he was aware that he did it
yah, i don't think he would deny that at all
yah, i feel tons better already 
yah, i figured that
yah, i found string-replace
yah, i get error too
yah, i gotta switch over to that
yah, i guess sync the maint-branch to the head first, then the schedule accel to the head, then re-branch from there
yah, i have fixed that in other case
yah, i have full admin rights 
yah, i have had mine since tues. and not had any probs
yah, i have that on my thinkpad
yah, i haven't gotten to stage it yet
yah, i just bring over hard disk :)
yah, i just did
yah, i just didn't recall any discussion of callfwding
yah, i just looked at resource-status ... it's a lot leaner than it was in 1.8.x
yah, i know
yah, i know - i just think a 5 minute call is quicker than email
yah, i like it
yah, i meant digital
yah, i never had any special fondness for pine, other than i could sort my email with it
yah, i put it in contacts
yah, i remember something about ISO-8851-LATIN-KINGS
yah, i saw some stuff in the bug regarding to be specified later or whatever
yah, i should git goin
yah, i should pick that one up
yah, i should probably hack that so we can upgrade 1.8.1 smoothly with firewall down
yah, i sort of selectively remember that stuff ... 
yah, i still gotta do better sorting but i'm liking it
yah, i think it's kind of annoying to type 'make' in the java directory and have to wait for the fscking manual to build
yah, i think it's supposed to tell you that you can't make the allocation but it's the user's responsibility to fix the problem
yah, i think kathleen and tony were the only ones who got jobs, huh?
yah, i think we are still on the phone system though
yah, i think we could actually
yah, i thought about upgrading their server, but it was during hours, and a little risky
yah, i understand
yah, i use APOP
yah, i wanna upgrade syracuse first 
yah, i was just confused cause their sources.list was not including non-free and contrib
yah, i was just making sure that was known
yah, i woudl think that would go higher in the framework
yah, i'll mess with that
yah, i'm backtracing
yah, i'm going to hold off on the kansas stuff ... it's just a metadata field that needs to get properly migrated i think
yah, i'm just being whiny
yah, i'm looking at d-t now
yah, i'm on that now
yah, i'm sure he'll recover after his vacation
yah, i've tried and tried to reproduce it but I dunno what i'm doing wrong
yah, if it's runtime in 1.8, than you add it to *wcof-features* or something
yah, if jesse sets a bad example by not writing tests, you know I'll never write them
yah, if that is actually what MFranco was talking about
yah, if there were closed prematurely
yah, if they are indeed nude
yah, if we can get both test instances runnig that would be good
yah, if you configure manually, then you can run update-to-frozen
yah, if your isp didn't operate outta Islamibad it would probably work better
yah, ignore
yah, ilisp's fault
yah, im a little concerned that they will need some hand holding
yah, im still hangin onlogin
yah, in 1.8.
yah, in 1.8.1 it's all runtime
yah, in 2.0 we don't have anything like wcof-entity
yah, in 90-91, about 8 months
yah, in ours, employee
yah, in potty right this moment tho
yah, in principle do the simplest possible thing you can, because they almost definetly are goin to want everythin changed 20 times
yah, in results
yah, in the allocation summary they show up as candidates right?
yah, in the clim subdir, mcclim-compat.lisp
yah, in the import iut would not matter, it's gotta revbuild all the indexes at least once, and it does that, only once
yah, indeed
yah, indeed.
yah, indexes are different from slots and properties
yah, integers
yah, interpret it that way
yah, is cool
yah, is it clearly notated who gets it tonight?
yah, is it ina  reservation with unserialized resources?
yah, is ok
yah, is our bad
yah, it allows him to do that efun closing oer the %lisp-oi-fun alien routine
yah, it appears that JHU got a bad checkout 8)
yah, it appears that same bad data is out there with gopher resolving to 200.200
yah, it appears we go wrong not so much with feature creep bits, but with the time for major reengineering
yah, it could be excel
yah, it could be something besides the firewall i'm sure
yah, it did:
yah, it didn't say it didn't load :)
yah, it does
yah, it does seem like that, interesting
yah, it doesn't generally like it
yah, it drops the index before moving the table
yah, it fits with operation actually
yah, it freaked me out
yah, it good
yah, it has temporary migration tables in
yah, it is
yah, it is a bit stronger
yah, it is fast fast fast
yah, it is pretty
yah, it is way solid, all nice hardwood, and beautiful tatami mats, make the whole house smell like alfalfa
yah, it just got done running alloc-rules on something too
yah, it just popped down at that moment
yah, it just takes a while
yah, it kinda is
yah, it kinda reminds me of the cure
yah, it looks like cmucl is not configured
yah, it looks like the site-name was not set at the right time
yah, it might be adam @:)
yah, it might need apt from testing, I dunno
yah, it moved from wco to saic user on alpha
yah, it needs a review
yah, it opens ports but never responds
yah, it says looks like they are already corrected
yah, it seems pretty good
yah, it shoudl all work
yah, it should be sql quoted as 'WOMAN''S STUDIES' IIRC
yah, it should get past that
yah, it should work now
yah, it shows fine for me
yah, it spooked her
yah, it stays green
yah, it sucks for me - i know they would answer if it were the chancellor!!
yah, it turns off key echo at pword prompt, and in your ctrl-cing it doesn't turn it back on in the interrupt handler
yah, it was a *resource-schedule* issue
yah, it was funny
yah, it was just a problem with dates getting passed as 0 index or not
yah, it was my bad saying it was ok to do that at all
yah, it was the best
yah, it was up-to-date
yah, it was, cause she then called adam
yah, it wasn't me
yah, it will be
yah, it will fix that one at least, but not hte wcof-destroy bug
yah, it works on hm
yah, it works, we justneed to document it better on the website
yah, it would be 2.0.6
yah, it would be alpha
yah, it would probably make the trip seem twice as long, too
yah, it wwould have to be caused by a start transaction with a missing commit
yah, it's UDP
yah, it's WCO in 1.8, not wcof
yah, it's a DB binding issue apparently
yah, it's a copy
yah, it's a drag
yah, it's a good collection of factoids
yah, it's a good toolkit
yah, it's a known bug, their isntance is not sufficiently up to date
yah, it's a lame *resource-schedules* problem
yah, it's a listp
yah, it's a little wierd though
yah, it's a small code change
yah, it's a whine.
yah, it's abasically a new application
yah, it's all ed
yah, it's all unix man
yah, it's all wrong
yah, it's an index search I bet
yah, it's anetwork thing
yah, it's basically my avorite temperature range
yah, it's been there a while...
yah, it's being saved, just for some reason not int he demo stuff for creating locs
yah, it's breaking the POST portion of the query into chunks
yah, it's building passes
yah, it's cinapps only in fact
yah, it's cool
yah, it's critical to be able to attach multiple holdings to a bib record
yah, it's dead
yah, it's defaintely acting slow
yah, it's easy...
yah, it's fine, it breaks acceptable
yah, it's good
yah, it's good to me
yah, it's gotta be reaped for me
yah, it's hairy still
yah, it's identical
yah, it's install-roles failing
yah, it's internal to condition and not portable and icky
yah, it's just a change to the chromose assembler
yah, it's just not finding the file
yah, it's just not my style, my volume is such that skimming works presently
yah, it's just that I only tested the border case
yah, it's just that authorization is fialing
yah, it's just that it's like in the worse possible place for sleeping, outside edge of lower back, just below where te rib cage ends
yah, it's kinda like a pickup and make changes at the same time
yah, it's late, I need to sleep
yah, it's literally a barbecue chip with the sweet backend of the barbeque flavor replaced with a sharp heat
yah, it's making my teeth rattle all the way over here, it's 4 miles away
yah, it's metnioned but not in the right context
yah, it's mod_webapp locking up
yah, it's more straightfoward.  The IMHO code is more of a work in progress
yah, it's nice.
yah, it's not a display issue, those are valid ptr oids
yah, it's not hard to do
yah, it's not his freinds that are moving to Canada in the middle of the night
yah, it's not so magical...
yah, it's not updated by setup-wco-land
yah, it's ok
yah, it's on boog 3645
yah, it's read-only
yah, it's really done
yah, it's self-identifying
yah, it's something in the 3.1 setup.sh or other mods that required c-l-c 
yah, it's still kind of a hickety hack
yah, it's the account thing...
yah, it's the same problem we had in one of the early 2.0 releases
yah, it's too hard to hack, and it's edgy
yah, it's too much ofa logical pathname pain to try
yah, it's way fucked
yah, it's wierd they're not returning calls or answering phones
yah, it's wierd... I'm kinda here and there a lot... hard to describe exactly what it is
yah, iterating into the future by 5 minute increments is not gonna cut it :)
yah, its invalid
yah, its not a problemo in potato
yah, jeff is mentioning some bugs closed but not fixed on his instnace...
yah, jesse just said we did
yah, jesse pretty much kicked this stuffs butt already
yah, josh can do that easily enough 8)
yah, josh your anus is just not funny anymore
yah, julia had done aikido for a year or so about 13 years ago, it's the same sensei and he remembered her
yah, just a dozen little niggling problems popped up one after another, making it take me half an hour to log into the Baylor box 8)
yah, just checked the code.  Full import will compare persons prop-by-prop and fix it
yah, just did it to me too 8)
yah, just go downt he stack and see if it's in every-five-minutes
yah, just go off of head
yah, just got me
yah, just grab the id and the name
yah, just internal
yah, just let me get what I can get and we'll get the rest tomorrow or thurs
yah, just msg change
yah, just no rtypes in the applet
yah, just no the way we're used to
yah, just nominally hijacked a session
yah, just noticed
yah, just noticed that myself
yah, just pop onto #webco when you needs it ... the tester's name is Dag
yah, just recorded new track this weekend
yah, just remove the disconnect then
yah, just removing dead code, commented all publically exposed classes and slots and functions
yah, just saw you get kicked
yah, just silent ignoral
yah, just so there was a version in CVS for this boffo usc release tag thingy
yah, just some of them tho
yah, just some stiching together left
yah, just take care of it as you see fit...
yah, just that their budget is small for customizations
yah, just the POP3 program
yah, just use webcheckout or root
yah, justcocured to me
yah, keep him in line :)
yah, keep it simple
yah, keep it up
yah, kernel-image-2.2.19-compact.deb
yah, kicking ass
yah, kill it for crissakes
yah, kill that pls
yah, kinda
yah, kinda chilly here too
yah, kristine just followed you
yah, let me do that
yah, let me get out, and you refresh. I need to make a phone call anyway.
yah, let me recover my sessiona nad build clean and then commit
yah, let me run setup.sh et al
yah, let us transmit all of our students contact info over FTP
yah, let's make it on by default
yah, lets do so
yah, lets finish those I think...
yah, lets hear it for 'dict'
yah, lets take it easy tonight
yah, license and annual is the only way to succeed here
yah, like I said in the original media spec, MARC is an exchange format, not a data model
yah, like I said, I been building and running it for awhile
yah, like Rawkus!
yah, like Wener Van Braun in Gravity's rainbow
yah, like a real top, pull the end of the headwrap and watch em spin
yah, like ages ago
yah, like i often sarch for bootie and tatas for purely academic reasons
yah, like if we want to normalize caoitalization in names or otherwise scrub the data, then going thru classes would make so much more sense.  If we don't need that stuf, then direct table twiddling on a limited basis is ok
yah, like that.
yah, like vanilla strawberry?
yah, like you can't have 2 resources with the same label, barcode needs to be the same way
yah, like you said
yah, lilo withthe little chroot option thingie
yah, line 110

yah, look up 'kludge' in the index
yah, lookat the accept-input :around method in form-elements on html-form
yah, looking at gopher, we have two clients we need to support there, both can run 3.0
yah, looks like I did cause a boog
yah, looks like I want an rpn-exp which rpn-op and rpn-attr-term derive from so I have a common interface for result cacheing and query manip
yah, looks like it
yah, looks like it's just copy over the own-work directory
yah, looks like nothing is using it tho
yah, looks like only onshored domain got loaded by their server
yah, looks like search-form issue
yah, looks like the tags are in sync now
yah, looks like we still hav esome stuck checkout situations
yah, looks like we're lacking people import test data, shame
yah, looks sweeet
yah, lost a ton of bullshitmail
yah, lyn knows
yah, lyn rocks at the optimization stuff
yah, mabye opus could get a certain subject and know to msg a person...
yah, macs don't like when you use more than one application per session
yah, make it so
yah, many problems there..
yah, marc.lisp eh
yah, marvin
yah, mary couldn't get http to it either, but I did a traceroute with no problem
yah, mary jane...
yah, maybe
yah, maybe Stockton can retire now
yah, maybe just do a new one ... there's not much info there, it looks pretty out of date ... 
yah, maybe those fuckers have it written already, just not released
yah, me and him talked to him about that the other day
yah, me and lee can make you a carload of that
yah, me had outage
yah, me too
yah, me too beech
yah, me too, I will need ot read indexing.lisp and the changelogs
yah, me too, off to weekend for record buying
yah, me too.
yah, me too...
yah, meant to do that before but it dropppd out the bottom of my todo
yah, merci
yah, metadata stuff is a bitch to build queries for and cannot support logical ops
yah, might be cute for 3.1 ...
yah, mike said give him 2 mins then go
yah, most churches send their teenagers to apalacia to do missionary work
yah, move holdings into seperate tab too
yah, move on baby

yah, mozilla has a boog about that
yah, much simpler index set
yah, must be RH 6.1
yah, must be cache
yah, must do
yah, my 56K modem dials up at a whopping 28800 due to my shite phone line
yah, my bad I think
yah, my bad, sorry
yah, my instance is running it
yah, my logic was too fragile
yah, my pop has a extra coronary on one side of his heart that is keeping him alive
yah, my responses are held
yah, need some sql-sys::on-txn-aborts perhaps
yah, needs a patch for ilisp I mean
yah, needs a patch for ppc
yah, neither did saic testing nor wcodemo
yah, network works, I'm in 
yah, new behavior, not neccesarrily new class or method

yah, not sure what I can do about that tho
yah, not sure what's up with that
yah, not too bad.
yah, nothing like some 19 yr old twit with an overinflated sense of importance attempting to flame you on something he knows nothing about
yah, nothing sets it

yah, on the ride in I said to myself this was the first day when sweat cooled me off, instead of making me clammy chilly 
yah, on what instance is this all on?
yah, one branch aka root
yah, one for our side!
yah, one o those two.  I like Down with the deadly rythym of the production line
yah, one of those character-building epics
yah, one of those things you wanna get the details right
yah, one of you returned it, but it will display as returned for both of yah 8)
yah, only the data can tell you that
yah, oook is right. 
yah, option 2
yah, or adam's  Actually using adam's would be better
yah, or rerunning mk:oos whatever 
yah, or some way to get access to master again so I can upload
yah, or to just shut up the warnings
yah, org admin always had bypass pin capability I think
yah, otherwise we would have seen it elsewhere
yah, our first 1.7.2 -> 1.8.2 upgrade
yah, our paralellization of fuckups is critical to our accomplishing the business goals we've set for ourselves
yah, our phone system sux for customers
yah, out of San Jose I think, or that might just be the local station that transmitz
yah, outlaw it, it was a tool of terrorist attack
yah, pam good tester
yah, parc is setup correctly
yah, parted does it too
yah, people who don't bike say they would bike if they had bike lanes
yah, perfect
yah, perhaps
yah, pg was going googlyboogly
yah, piece of merde
yah, pikcup and return times can be a bitch with our current setup
yah, plan on an average of 4 patron-initiated screwups per year :)
yah, please do
yah, pls
yah, plus cvs-update
yah, plz
yah, po-tater
yah, poor lori
yah, poor violetta has roots
yah, postgres debug should do that I think
yah, precisely
yah, presently
yah, pretty fast, but marc import is so slow even this box dogs
yah, pretty good; not very sunny here and fireworks rained out
yah, pretty much
yah, pretty slow
yah, probably
yah, probably woody
yah, production instance bugs for instance
yah, projex stupidity...
yah, prolly
yah, property based mostl
yah, prudent, but not blocker
yah, quick day
yah, quite good
yah, rafe, whatever
yah, rc#.d isn't installed you mean
yah, real early june stuff, according to the changelogs
yah, real low level
yah, really
yah, really went tore into it there @:)
yah, really...
yah, recheck the bug
yah, redirect the bug to mean that...
yah, regional chains where in the first cycle
yah, released works fine
yah, remembah
yah, reopened
yah, repair tags
yah, restarted again
yah, retro-grouchin'
yah, return is busted
yah, returning everyone
yah, right
yah, right.
yah, rockin
yah, rollback is working too, just commited it all
yah, run that.
yah, run-script workee
yah, running it dootr
yah, saic has problems there
yah, saic is no problem
yah, saing it already uses the correct one
yah, same fail
yah, same project, differnt part of it
yah, saw one just the other day, me and jesse.
yah, saw that
yah, saw that already
yah, saw that earlier
yah, saw that on the Marxism list actually 8)
yah, saw the boog
yah, saw your mail
yah, sched core changes need tutoring
yah, schedule-trees is an lru cache in 3.0
yah, screen rocks until it bites you, which it does every time you use it
yah, screens all gone
yah, scroll back in your IRC buffer
yah, scrolly is fixed
yah, second one this morning
yah, see ya
yah, see, something's there...
yah, seems a bit crunchy
yah, seems kinda pasee, yellow fever
yah, seems like general code reduction
yah, seems so
yah, seems to be
yah, seems to be up
yah, seen that.
yah, she said so
yah, ship the CDs in cans!
yah, shit
yah, should be
yah, should be done
yah, should be easy next time
yah, should be harmless
yah, should be int he wizard, and also person detail screen
yah, showdown at the pastillo stand
yah, since we will be working in emacs all the time anyways
yah, skip that one
yah, slaps -h BotPoints, botsnacks are +1
yah, sloppy 1.8.3 upgrades
yah, snag that dutr
yah, sniff
yah, so 1985
yah, so I see...
yah, so can we go back to the original ideas we had, josh's freind in particular?
yah, so it should be a function of the # of resources I bet
yah, so like 1.8.6 has been running around doing all it's work without using indexes 
yah, so much for carpe diem
yah, so much for that, huh
yah, so that is the overhead we don't wanna pay.  IN most cases that array will be mostly emptyt
yah, so true to reality
yah, so who cares
yah, so you have changed your mind about the EJB shit eh?
yah, so?
yah, some agents are calling Chicago a buyers market now
yah, some little dinky fixes left
yah, some of those are really beautifully done
yah, someone really will need to fix demo and dev on the head
yah, someone was real slopppy here with the release tags
yah, someone wrot e abusted update-resource-event-structure function
yah, someone's gotta be...
yah, somethings tend to get lost in translation
yah, sometimes, fuck can be a very powerful slang word eh?
yah, sometimes, one place I don't know it is in the media stuff right now
yah, somewhere in cali anyways
yah, sorry
yah, sorry, I'm lagged here
yah, sorry, forgot to upload it
yah, sounds good
yah, sounds like our stuff is ok, dunno about the category errors...
yah, sounds like things are moving!
yah, spec'd that b4
yah, spotted that
yah, star ta mosh pit
yah, starting at the beggining, up thru rules for addition and multiplication
yah, steamed, or braised, hmmmm
yah, still
yah, stop trying
yah, stores are getting really crowded. people are getting off work early.
yah, storms just mellowing out a bit her
yah, strange
yah, sure
yah, sure, however you wanna engineer it that makes sense
yah, sure, why not
yah, sure...
yah, surely
yah, surrogate damage again
yah, sweet ain't it!
yah, talking to dan-b about it now
yah, taloking to alex now
yah, taught so
yah, tell him he should stop by next week for lunch or something and we'll have some time to show him the app
yah, tell them to call Sun with their complaint
yah, thankfully we don't have any know-it-alls around here
yah, thanx
yah, that
yah, that already feeexed
yah, that always helps
yah, that can actually be removed entriely, the only place it is used is the end of instance-bykey in cae there is no EC in context
yah, that could be the issue
yah, that could get a bit opressive
yah, that could go on the milestone...
yah, that doesn't seem entirely inappropriate
yah, that doesn't work in woody
yah, that gets it, fixed
yah, that in itself is not a blocker or anythig... comes under that 1.8 stuff, actually
yah, that is OK.  You heard Rawkus' Soundbombing?
yah, that is SOOO management
yah, that is a nice effect
yah, that is another way to make the whole thing a single peice
yah, that is cool web site
yah, that is it, disk
yah, that is kinda a bitch... is there a way to boil it down to behavior of a wcof function?
yah, that is kinda wierd about it
yah, that is my main concern, but my experience with it has been excellent
yah, that is not what utils.lisp wants anymore
yah, that is right out
yah, that is strange
yah, that is the ideal solution
yah, that is the key.
yah, that is the one he was talking about
yah, that is the real power of the itnernet, instant commodofication of software
yah, that is the right thing
yah, that is the scary bit, pray for the Palestinians.
yah, that is they way it should be
yah, that is true
yah, that is unblievably small
yah, that is very nice
yah, that is what I am leaning towards
yah, that is what I bet
yah, that is what I got too.
yah, that is what I is fixing
yah, that is what I was just about to lament
yah, that make sense
yah, that makes sense
yah, that makes sense with devel going on the HEAD
yah, that might be nice....
yah, that must be it
yah, that must have been it
yah, that one
yah, that seems acceptable
yah, that seems possible
yah, that seems possible, totally
yah, that seems to work
yah, that should be fine
yah, that should do it I think
yah, that should never happen
yah, that should work
yah, that should work too actually
yah, that song is amazing 
yah, that sounds good
yah, that sounds lame
yah, that sounds nice
yah, that stuff is just slow
yah, that sucked for me but we had other things to talk about
yah, that too
yah, that total is wrong too
yah, that was a good un
yah, that was a scary bug
yah, that was an autoconf blopper that was fixed a while ago
yah, that was my impression
yah, that was the location-root thing i think
yah, that way we can assure proper three teir architecture since we have a language barrier between our teirs
yah, that will break some things
yah, that would be fine too... you can add a comment to 2910
yah, that would be good
yah, that would be the best...
yah, that would work.
yah, that wouldbe the first step  refactoring
yah, that's a good call
yah, that's a good store
yah, that's a lot more contentious than I like to see
yah, that's a nice way to do it
yah, that's a way lopsided tree
yah, that's after adam fires me
yah, that's all I need
yah, that's all I've spotted on 3621
yah, that's always the hard part, but it saves time over the long haul.
yah, that's an older topic I haven't redone since documenting circ policies.
yah, that's annoying
yah, that's bad
yah, that's because auto-circ was there
yah, that's because wcof-start-session overridees the listener
yah, that's consistent
yah, that's different
yah, that's fine
yah, that's fine4
yah, that's good
yah, that's got a pretty complex scoring system, possible tie-in-able with some sort of web of trust, but that's pretty applciation specific
yah, that's got the nord mod tekno science
yah, that's it
yah, that's kinda how it works... migration bugs can only be found empirically
yah, that's my todo
yah, that's needed it hink
yah, that's nice
yah, that's not allowed
yah, that's not good
yah, that's not it
yah, that's not valid
yah, that's ok
yah, that's old ... note the timestamp
yah, that's pretty fuckin' rockin'
yah, that's pretty genius
yah, that's probably best to start
yah, that's probalby it, denver is pg 7
yah, that's prolly it then... 
yah, that's right, you said you were max'd on the week already
yah, that's right.
yah, that's set
yah, that's the 95% case
yah, that's the bug there.
yah, that's the one
yah, that's the only way to do it
yah, that's the right thing
yah, that's the right working hypothesis
yah, that's the ticket
yah, that's the whole problem with operator-initiated email
yah, that's to be expected
yah, that's trivial
yah, that's true
yah, that's what I got now
yah, that's what I mean
yah, that's what I read too 8)
yah, that's what I said dutr.  It's not how fast it goes witha  demo dataset, it's how fast it goes with the heavy usage resource schedules
yah, that's what I said, color changing
yah, that's what I'm saying fluffy for a good deal of work in a tight schedule
yah, that's what i meant
yah, that's what is was.
yah, that's what makes the changelogs on the web-co project page
yah, that's why that is not exported
yah, that's wierd
yah, that'sprolly it
yah, thats serious shit
yah, thats the XP thing
yah, thats what it was, oil change, airport home etc...
yah, the 1.5 to 1.6.1 migration presently should work
yah, the 2ndary list is way screwed
yah, the MARC import put the subject hiearchy and all that shit into a set of index tables
yah, the Notice thing.
yah, the SQL interface, in particular the object oriented part of it
yah, the auth warning
yah, the best of Engels
yah, the bets off bit
yah, the brits went APESHIT for this record
yah, the build went ok, I can't load dev
yah, the commit itself will update the RCS vars
yah, the don't mind staring anyhow
yah, the entry on Eudora sez Instructions Needed
yah, the fact that it's standard-db-object is kew
yah, the fee wasn't
yah, the first set of things I commited earlier, read logs
yah, the first thing you should get done is 2907
yah, the fix is in fixes.lisp
yah, the frameset is kinda wrong in some minor ways.... it has a form element there atop the frameset which can't be right
yah, the friendly visitin'
yah, the fsdb is nifty because it's cheap object composition, it's just one step
yah, the gays in NY are agressive, like brazilian street kids with tourists
yah, the germans probably have better offerings
yah, the high pitched buzz is soothing
yah, the iBook is purty cheep too,a nd not a bad machine
yah, the important thing is getting the top-level categories to make sense
yah, the instructions for creating the class seem fine so far
yah, the integration testing priorities are lower, btw
yah, the interface is a bit complex for group edit
yah, the media thing is moving, and 2.0.X is stabilizing, despite your swooning
yah, the metadata tables an get quite large
yah, the modalities might be confusing
yah, the most exploitable labor!
yah, the mozbot bugzilla code is crappy as hell
yah, the name kind sucks IMO
yah, the navbar icons
yah, the navbar thing
yah, the nestlings are hatching
yah, the only difference between charge and credit appears to be disposition
yah, the projex file is totally not registering the DTD properly
yah, the reason they are not followed tho is because we only use regression tests at certain points int he devel cycle
yah, the relation
yah, the rule is there
yah, the saic bunch don't use the mail lists much
yah, the slim thinkpads are the one
yah, the spiel
yah, the standard emacs mime package dutr
yah, the tags have been applied
yah, the times are two long perhaps
yah, the transaction thing is not a cache really
yah, the vice-versa is lower priority
yah, the whining pig-dog home entertainment enthusiasts who blew all that cash on DVDs so they can watch their lame hollywood ballbusters are screaming bbloody murder
yah, the wife turned me on to that
yah, the year after I got mine they went all to hell
yah, then you need to address him
yah, theoretically is the key word there 8)
yah, there are things that should bw rapped in without-context
yah, there is a limit to how hot my lap can get
yah, there is a test-people-import.lisp in wcof-tests
yah, there is nota  debian package for it.  I asked them to put it into CVS
yah, there is something seriously wrong with the demo load
yah, there it is in the about box
yah, there must be a bug where it should be getting rtype info from cache but it's reloading all rtypes every time
yah, there seems to be, for sure
yah, there's a lot of music I love that I can't listen to while working
yah, there's a piece of the mit spec that covers that
yah, there's actually another problem to that
yah, there's an entry on wiki in there
yah, there's probably some spurious REvents needing removed from their data
yah, these are all just bad data problems from migrated data, so they are blockers, but not serious issues since they are one-time hits
yah, these guys are ok, they're just feeling violated because i roughed up they sweet baby
yah, they all did back then
yah, they all do that
yah, they already paid, right?
yah, they are kinda slow to render tho, but I that can be fixed with a good Java implementation
yah, they are partially picked up or something, and I have integrity checks to fix those
yah, they are saying go ahead and proceed *unless* they hear from you
yah, they are the cost of a nice workstation
yah, they didn't have CLIM to work with
yah, they don't have a route to prep
yah, they get the point I think
yah, they got skinnier
yah, they have a soft steel or aluminum sleeve
yah, they have only been shooting people in the head, not the add
yah, they just put a tape in and lip sync to everything
yah, they just smell like farts
yah, they kind of get mushed together
yah, they know I don't feel it's on spec
yah, they make pro tools
yah, they need to change their wicky wack password anyway
yah, they suck
yah, they take it seriously up in viking country
yah, they were some old fogies for sure
yah, they will just be doing forwarding
yah, they wiped all Onshore Devel stuff
yah, think so
yah, thirty lashes to the reporter
yah, this app is indeed a mess
yah, this bag of flamin hot cheetos smells like a old person fart
yah, this is a mix tape he did with his 4-track
yah, this is on denver
yah, this is similiar to one of the ideas I had, so that's reassuring that we're at least seeing the same thing
yah, this office mary has is nice
yah, those are all mind I think, the white chocolate I'm not too sure of, but could be
yah, those are only used by the circulation screen, nowhere else, all new stuff
yah, those are people who ride bikes, the people who don't like lanes, lanes are horrid for dorring
yah, those are the ones I mean... so no ?
yah, thought to
yah, thst's shitty
yah, time to eat eat eat
yah, time to get the wool out of mothballs
yah, time to roll it up for the night.
yah, timeouts with inactivy dutr
yah, tinderbox will help with fingerpointing
yah, tis not on pollo
yah, tis old
yah, to compensate for the idiocy of PIX
yah, too sweet
yah, totally
yah, totally.  I just call it EOF for the most part
yah, touring bike
yah, true
yah, true dat
yah, true on that one
yah, true, it should be more informative
yah, try that
yah, trying to add it
yah, turning defvar-function into defun is pretty easy in emacs
yah, ucb.webcheckout.net
yah, uit's totally trivial and in the meantime I'm just gonna change it to default to :must-exist nil
yah, um, can you say derivative ?
yah, um, that's what it should show
yah, um...
yah, umich?
yah, unless they reboot it
yah, until david grohl got a hold of his demo
yah, update-to-frozen -r wco_release_2_0_3 -b ; update-to-head -b
yah, usc too, but if you can put them off, that's good
yah, using windows makes me feel ANSI.
yah, usually
yah, usually if it's a major bug i tell them we'll get right on it, and if it's something minor i tell them we will get it in the next release
yah, usually if you re-evaluate a defsetf that's already been eval'd you get that warning
yah, very good suggestion, I like it
yah, very windy and wet eh?
yah, victim of my own laziness
yah, wack
yah, wacky
yah, was an 11 hour day yesterday
yah, was basic, let me try the others
yah, was just gonna ask for that, to check on the offline migration problem
yah, was just wondering what time, so I could optimize resrvations
yah, was lambdaMOO, in the old days
yah, was news to me when I came across it too
yah, way too Death Row
yah, we are almost thru that bottle
yah, we built LOIS out of oil filters
yah, we can run the test once I get that built tommorow
yah, we can set it up on relleno or some machine here and have it be e relay for other mp3 streams, that way only one copy of the stream has to come down the pipe
yah, we can specify the precise linux ftp server that needs to be used...
yah, we can travel thru college towns everywhere without buying our own beers now
yah, we did, last night
yah, we do
yah, we don't live in manhattan tho
yah, we found it
yah, we get it
yah, we had like 250MB of simple-base-strings
yah, we have emergancies here
yah, we have finally drilled it into him
yah, we jammed in the snoreland
yah, we might as well install the UPS packages
yah, we need an en_MOOK translation
yah, we need some hardcore testing
yah, we need to have dynamic binding of alot of those things during the entire request handling phase
yah, we need to line-item it
yah, we only bought it a year ago
yah, we shall see over the next couple days huh
yah, we shoiuld write an x-files episode for it
yah, we should change that
yah, we should figure out a good bot to run.... 
yah, we should move to the head I think
yah, we should release 2.0.6 soon
yah, we tend to hate C-a as the screen out-of-band char
yah, we will be officially be pushed back
yah, we'd rather too :) but hey, we made the bed, we gotta lie in it
yah, we'll be sure to upload this evening before breaking
yah, we'll see all right
yah, we're all implicated
yah, we're both on
yah, we're breaking ns4 I think
yah, we're going to try to avoid  branching if possible
yah, we're gonna need some good testing for 2.1
yah, we're gonna pay 260 a month for this
yah, we're in the gritty now
yah, webco support chanerr
yah, webco-support list
yah, well
yah, well I left out some context cause I thought you had run intot he same problem when you asked about the method
yah, well looking at the t1 at SBA, we do about 2kBps
yah, well stop it
yah, well that is two hosts, two different OSs
yah, well, I won't be here...
yah, well, I'm starting in the deep end here
yah, well, dude, we fucked up on 2.0.9 release it's clare
yah, well, due what ya gotta my boy
yah, well, gotta convert it to something to get $$
yah, well, he usually has to go pickup violetta at 4 anyhow
yah, well, it might be just alpha slow or something
yah, well, it will continue forwarding if you do that
yah, well, it's gettingt he info there that's time consuming
yah, well, it's not about genius, generally
yah, well, one of the reservations that is causing the melt-down is in the past
yah, well, pretty much in any area I go to, patrons, rsrcs, rtypes, loc admin, there's problmes
yah, well, that doens't make it true! 
yah, well, there's a switch we were thinking of making tomorrah
yah, well, they can suck it
yah, well, they won't be starting entry before tomorrow, if that's what you were asking
yah, well, what do you think?
yah, well...
yah, well... there's your fix
yah, well... they are like that down there...
yah, welll, I had some thoughts....
yah, westmalle wins
yah, what I did is add:
yah, what I'm digging about it is that it's making SQL prgrammable, like Lisp itsel fis programmable
yah, what are you in?
yah, what do we need it for?
yah, what is up with opus?
yah, what kinds?
yah, what the hell
yah, what would the cutey at Flo think if he asked for ana pple juice in the morning?
yah, whatcha doing?
yah, whatefver, no shortage of integers I guess
yah, whatever
yah, whats up with that
yah, when I start up my lisp .cmucl does not get read.
yah, when a cop just trying to make conversation about my bike asked if it had a brake, I told him it had a coaster brake 8)
yah, when any instance of that components is called into action actually
yah, when you restart it it gets confused when it can't find things it wants to connect to
yah, where is it's CVS archive?
yah, where is just not editable after an invoice has been made
yah, which emacs?
yah, which is what we use to identify something at being Faculty Reserve
yah, which is what we used to call orgs etc...  
yah, who is the slacker holding up the release adam?
yah, who needs a window manager?
yah, why not
yah, wish I had time to work with it more
yah, with her husband tagging along
yah, with his Nite Klub
yah, with much stuff that I added
yah, with programmatic SQL interface, which becomes fairly important
yah, with the Kikyo frog
yah, won't take long at all
yah, word
yah, word up
yah, work thread error handling can stand a rework for sure
yah, works ok?
yah, would be good
yah, would you like to buy some snow futures?
yah, wouldn't it be great to go to iran and see the sights?
yah, wwgnats is not parsing the shit properly
yah, yah
yah, yah, ok
yah, yer outta luck
yah, yer right
yah, yer right, disabled on saic, not in cvs
yah, yesterday
yah, yo have PG problems
yah, you Java based lisp transponder would handle that, so you can have it invoke a method and get back a list of records
yah, you and your non-seperate axles will be greased
yah, you are preparing us for a forary into pit barbeque design
yah, you better say 4 8)
yah, you booting?
yah, you can do that, that should work
yah, you can easily edit the URL too
yah, you can jakc up your font sizes
yah, you can just make a default query, that's fine
yah, you can see what I was hitting there...
yah, you could learn more about the system in the down time
yah, you crashed it by not having any open times for your location
yah, you didn't have much time to work on it
yah, you do
yah, you do very well...
yah, you don't need to know root passwd anymore, just your own
yah, you go tthe reports back in shape
yah, you got bad pacakge installs for the supporting stuff
yah, you got that boog?
yah, you gotta flush the *resoure-schedules*
yah, you guys really did
yah, you had bad metadata object hanging about in your session's editing context
yah, you know how to do the sector format right?
yah, you look like it
yah, you might have overreached there
yah, you might have to disable your default keyring
yah, you might still get the Hi Score!
yah, you might wanna put an updated trace on thaqt
yah, you need a proxy server
yah, you probably need to 
yah, you said before
yah, you said it
yah, you said it's the muslim coalition army that should
yah, you should update that
yah, you would want to use, say, turnaround * 4 between one reservationa nd another so as to avoid problems
yah, you'd have to
yah, you'd have to grab the libstdc++ from woody is all
yah, you'll be done before me :)
yah, you're  abig italian in New Jersey
yah, you're not int he middle of trying to wrap your head around allocation core either
yah, you're point is definately valid
yah, you're right
yah, you're right...that's what I forgot
yah, your house jsut keeps getting visited by very picky theives
yah, your two hours ahead, soyou gota be starving
yah, youre' right
yah,I saw them come in
yah,cool
yah,it kinda hurts
yah,it's on the menu
yah,not really our bug at all.. I knew it was some sort of machine  thing
yah,t hat's going to make it easier on us, sure
yah,t hat's it
yah,t he garbage facts are neato tho
yah,that is the one I heard
yah,the cookies and the OSs suck
yah.
yah.  I also think he could contribute to webcheckout policy management and such
yah.  It tracks mods fairly well.
yah.  The Tribe too.  Sizzla too
yah.  Wether or not there i an audible difference, there is a definite philosophical issue there
yah.  doing design work on it right now
yah.  generating sql is so easy with the programmatic interface
yah.  the simple syntax with good indenting is easier ont he eyes
yah.  when I get my laptop I'll be able to be on IRC and get CVS updates from the pub down the street.  
yah. I restarted my emacs for the first time in 2 weeks.
yah. I saw your email.
yah. I should still be on that
yah. I work for Apple now.
yah. I'm thinking about getting my mom an iMac for Christmas this year.
yah. I'm totally tato
yah. a little mpeg encoder lameness there
yah. after I got laid off last spring, I just kept getting up at the same time. It's ok - I get a lot of productive time in in the mornings.
yah. and dts too.
yah. but got tons of technical backup and assist.
yah. excelelant
yah. lefty was telling me about that. Very pretty.
yah. no go on nt apparently
yah. on cnn.
yah. perhaps I'll just dump the NSTask crap.
yah. same as memoryx
yah. some sort of JNI foolishness

yea, Craig began merging on Friday
yea, I believe that is it exactly
yea, I can see that
yea, I didnt spend much time investigating it.  Gotta save somethign for today
yea, I dont care much for him ether.  That would totaly piss him off
yea, I dont think so
yea, I doubt there is migration code to 3.1
yea, I figured
yea, I figured as much
yea, I figured that
yea, I figured the hub was ungood
yea, I figured.
yea, I found it
yea, I found the problem
yea, I gathered that :-)
yea, I go there much
yea, I got it too
yea, I got mail from eric
yea, I got one more too
yea, I got the toot running on mysql
yea, I grok
yea, I guess
yea, I guess so
yea, I guess they do
yea, I hate those rewritable disks
yea, I have a grip on some of the group screen issues WRT efficiency
yea, I heard it
yea, I heard the spot for that on the way in
yea, I just got the fix in
yea, I just updated the instance that was there
yea, I keep mine up to date with testing
yea, I know
yea, I look forward to seeing what jesse's new gauntlet does
yea, I need a test set for 2.0.12 to 3.1
yea, I need to grab that module
yea, I rarely know what the hell Im talkign about
yea, I realy have no idea how the changes would have caused it
yea, I reckon
yea, I sent somethign to support about the conflict
yea, I think I have it down to about 10 random allocations per minute
yea, I think I'm going to switch over to windows so that I can be in the corporate know
yea, I think Monica and I would be game if there is room
yea, I think craig killed it
yea, I think so.  Unless I am asleep
yea, I thought they were installing apache
yea, I thouht we were gonna give that one a miss
yea, I try that.
yea, I want to launch this thing
yea, I was gonna ask you about bug 4533 is all
yea, I was just looking at that
yea, I was kinda hopping to get coverage by nesta and gracchus
yea, I was looking
yea, I was wondering how that was progressing
yea, I watched it
yea, Ill do it
yea, Ill get them today and stage them on umich.w.n
yea, Ill make it magenta
yea, Ill stick with my wires for now
yea, Im being careful
yea, Im getting there
yea, Im gonna call and tell them to keep the trouble ticket open
yea, Im gonna do it
yea, Im gonna institute somethign like a default deny policy
yea, Im guessing there may be alot of that.
yea, Im just workign through a location-schedule problem
yea, Im making breadsticks
yea, Im on it
yea, Im pretty buzzy right now
yea, Im saying it woudl not be easy for a client to do via odbc
yea, Im waiting for the mithril edition, or what ever trite name they are already givign the rerelease
yea, Im workign on the data dictioanry now and the conversion stuffen
yea, It should only take me a hour to do the firewall.
yea, Its a dupe of 4850
yea, Its not showing the box
yea, Jeffs good people
yea, New that Carl is gone he is near carcking
yea, TMBG
yea, UCB should NOT be vanguard
yea, actualy, you are correct
yea, also we need to get craigl out from under the control of usc
yea, an saic specifc search for round-up policies
yea, and Saturday
yea, and its minor
yea, and they have put up with alot
yea, and you can get a car adapter for your laptop and run it off the computer
yea, as long as we look on the ball it should be ok
yea, at least if everythign blows up then you can plausably say its not your fault :)
yea, branch
yea, bring me money too
yea, but 999 is probably better
yea, but I thought TT fonts were known to look blocky at many resolutions
yea, but docs dont bring in the dough
yea, but its better than loosing options off the bottom of the find-form
yea, but its prolly old
yea, but the Sept 15th release date is comming up hard
yea, byt I have the sql to do it, and its trivial
yea, check the database
yea, colors ar fine for me
yea, cool
yea, cross version testing will be a pain in theass
yea, doenst seem to set date-paid as it should
yea, done
yea, dudr just passed out one day and went head first into the pavement
yea, dumping people involves a great deal of list iteration
yea, file the bug and Ill get it
yea, fine
yea, fine by me
yea, fixed
yea, for mac it only supports firewire
yea, for what he wants to charge we could vastly improve our own connectivity
yea, fox it.
yea, get all those damn devel space hogs off there
yea, good call
yea, he has a knack
yea, he has enough on hip plate
yea, he wants me to do shit 80% with the expectation that the other 20 will come when we have spair time
yea, head
yea, hes a hunk
yea, hold on i'll get one in singapore
yea, hope its ok.
yea, how to let people use us as a relay if they spoof localhost
yea, i did update-to-head
yea, i figured that out.
yea, i have it trracjed down I think
yea, ill got it
yea, is the desire to ulimately move it?
yea, it can be avoided
yea, it does
yea, it expires for me rather alot
yea, it gets the allocation name in there
yea, it may be pserver
yea, it might be a bit more verbose
yea, it restored that time
yea, it seems like a client-pleaser
yea, it was my fault
yea, it will take a while
yea, it worked
yea, its a postgres warnign for a poor SQL statement
yea, its all a matter of naming it, since it is all those things
yea, its all fooked
yea, its fast
yea, its hot here too
yea, its kinda weak
yea, its meant to reassure
yea, its not to major
yea, its realy bad
yea, its slow
yea, its tests looks like it
yea, ittle work.
yea, josh and I were just talking about it
yea, josh directed it to me, no worries
yea, just blow it out on upgrade
yea, just rtype would be ambiguous
yea, lets do it
yea, lets get max to sign off
yea, lets go back to coal
yea, looking
yea, looks fine to me
yea, looks that way
yea, make them pay
yea, makes sence
yea, maybe if the user id is something they cant remember
yea, me too
yea, me too.  
yea, me too.  Cant wait for wast wing
yea, might be interesting to pursue at some later time
yea, muinutes hours days
yea, must be a relic
yea, my c skills are weak
yea, my coffee is on too
yea, my guess exactly
yea, my uncle uses my story as an example of why you should always steralize your tools
yea, nesta is workign on it
yea, nice lady
yea, no big whoop
yea, no probelm
yea, non-bug
yea, ok
yea, ok searching isnt working, but its a different kind of not working]
yea, ok, Ill either promote or demote
yea, ok.
yea, ok.  I dont have exact information
yea, ok.  Ill get that in there tonight
yea, ok. Go ahead and file the bug pam
yea, one of those is even fixed already i think
yea, or perls dolist
yea, part of the backporting stuff
yea, please email them, since acct-codes are expected to be unique and some of the matches are ratehr different.
yea, point 1 is bad
yea, poor little machien has a lot on its plate right now
yea, poor pervo rich guy
yea, probably best
yea, prolly.
yea, prove it
yea, quilt it
yea, really
yea, she has been working there for two years now
yea, she said.  She was returning from work
yea, she told me you were at artic
yea, slow, but Im getting there
yea, so I at least have to rebuild all the modules
yea, so, 2.0.x.y.z ?
yea, so, bad data
yea, some stuff is still broken, and some wasnt expected to migrate yet
yea, something like that
yea, sometimes your kinda clever
yea, sonds like every friggin thing I have done sinceI started at I-DEP
yea, sopmething with windows and tabs
yea, sorta
yea, stuff we dont need should just drop off the bottom
yea, take the advice of Greg Gallager and cradle your apathy pet
yea, thanks chevalier
yea, that as I figured
yea, that could be part of it
yea, that gave me heartburn
yea, that looks reasonable
yea, that one
yea, that one of the reasons its kinda gone unfixed
yea, that sounds right... i created new resources on the dev instance and did get it yesterday
yea, that sucks
yea, that would be bad
yea, that's great. I'm jealous. 
yea, thatll get you satisfaction
yea, thats a good practice
yea, thats a version 8 dump
yea, thats bad
yea, thats fine
yea, thats hozed
yea, thats it
yea, thats it exactly
yea, thats josh's schtick
yea, thats kinda cool
yea, thats kinda lame
yea, thats legacy.  Its been there a long time
yea, thats the one I just upgraded
yea, thats to be expected
yea, thats two or three things down on my stack right now
yea, thats wack, yes?
yea, thats what I heard
yea, thats what I heard.  still on the comittee
yea, thats what I though.
yea, thats what I was thinking.  But id and name are a must
yea, thats what i meant to do
yea, the Gorilla Award presentation
yea, the group file was the problem
yea, the interface is a bit wierd.  If you set the increment magnitude to 0 it goes away
yea, the passes file has changed
yea, the process hsould look for an extant session and gripe
yea, the whole index recovery code is fubar
yea, then I gotta park
yea, there are lots of places where focus should be assured
yea, there could be other open connections to it
yea, there is cost and price
yea, they are doing demo in another suite, and our office is filling with dust
yea, they are pretty good too
yea, they can just add it to the location description
yea, this is the finest produce I have ever gotten from them
yea, tlc got it
yea, to fix load order probelms
yea, today hase been mostly code reading for me
yea, too bad it killed the lisp I have running here and the lisp I should have opened in screen at home
yea, ucb is way more than that
yea, use the word line
yea, we just need to wait a few more months they walk in unopposed
yea, we shall see.  I wager that a visit to the North East of Arkansas will be enough to change her mind
yea, we should add an are you sure, you dope screen
yea, we should de-milestone it
yea, we were just talking about that beast
yea, we wnat searchability as well IIRC
yea, well I figured. 
yea, well Im taking notes first
yea, well as soon as MS got a OS line as close as one can expect to 'good' they had to drop it for a new one
yea, well josh says alot of things
yea, well now I gotta work on it again and I dont remember stuff
yea, well thats a temporary solution
yea, well, I guess its the season.  I just hope if it hits, its gona by the time my parents arrive
yea, well, Ill do my best
yea, well, he is prolly pricy
yea, well, they will break what you are doing I think
yea, well, we would have down time anyway
yea, what he said
yea, whats up with that?!?
yea, which shoudl be fine, but many of the test utilites are specificaly written to be called from within an open transaction
yea, who doth ween to strew myne pathe with vyle bygges 
yea, who is this
yea, why diverge from a proven strategy :)
yea, why not, I dont ignore enough mail as it is
yea, with 14000 allocations that can take a while
yea, wow
yea, you are correct
yea, you can set a sequence tables value
yea, you should
yea, you will need to know what you did
yea, your a sweety
yea, your right
yea.

yeah about Enron. Subsidiaries are set up offshore by financial service companies that deal in derivatives. They are setup with triple A ratings in order to comfort the customer that there's some liquidity in the fund. But Enron financed there subsidiaries with Enron stock. When it fell below a certain price, it triggered a demand for liaquidity from the sub. from Enron. So that's why they kep
yeah actually i guess it is
yeah actually i think that might be easier than the reports 
yeah actually the gov changed it recently

yeah but PD doesnt have the max stuff...Or am I wrong..?
yeah but bjork kind of moves in a totally different conceptual universe from radiohead or pj harvey
yeah but coltrane
yeah but i don't have write perms for the master server
yeah but if you were sending attachments with email we would see it
yeah but it can be lonely
yeah but it demos a little of interface...thats the point of the preview...is it tough or time consuming..?
yeah but it's the hardcore ones that carve his name into their arms with razors n shit
yeah but look at bottom
yeah but on WHAT?
yeah but the benefits were great!
yeah but the container is auto-circ. right?
yeah but the most ghetto production instance around
yeah but the yeast master is on...
yeah but then it came to the foreground
yeah but there's something nice about having a studio in your bedroom
yeah but there's still the issue of inserting the message into the page ... we need another include for that
yeah but they  are sexy tools, duh!
yeah but they are getting mo web werky so we need to upgrade a little..
yeah but they need to test rrt so its just for that not for using
yeah but we are not either
yeah but we can't really afford to dedicate a machine to demo
yeah but who
yeah but you just said that's the wrong directory
yeah but you say logging not loging
yeah but you should see her body
yeah bye 
yeah can you analyze those when that comes in?
yeah can't hurt to check

yeah he is about
yeah he is in his office
yeah he is pretty incomprehensible
yeah he knows it'll never happen as long as gas is cheap
yeah he makes like $30k on a good weekend
yeah he put on a good show for the 3 people that showed up
yeah he ran outside to watch the excitement
yeah he really struck a nerve with this thing

yeah he's too busy yachting and imagining the future to link libraries
yeah hehe
yeah hmm
yeah holle rache
yeah homie, hie thee hence
yeah how did it get preheat!?
yeah how many other people got to be millionaires by writing lisp software
yeah how was it
yeah hows it goin perfesser
yeah humboldt park niggaz should hold a capping workshop
yeah i 'm dum 
yeah i advised UIUC to do that
yeah i agree
yeah i agree ... we should train users with our demo data
yeah i always get jealous of all the london shows listed in the wire
yeah i am inclined to agree with craig
yeah i am listening now
yeah i am sure it's due to our semi-rigid java 1.0 compliance
yeah i amn here
yeah i assume the dec31 2001 stuff is more iffy
yeah i been meaning to
yeah i been there
yeah i bet
yeah i bet 
yeah i bet it is
yeah i bet nobody thought of that one ever
yeah i bet that number is busy
yeah i bet...
yeah i betcha its an xemacs.  real emacs would never blaspheme by displaying a bitmap
yeah i better log some of that shit before i forget
yeah i blew off chris's presentation tonight
yeah i can connect to them with lynx so it's not a 404 or the host being down
yeah i can do 'em 
yeah i can give you the number of a dude there too...
yeah i can go stroll around looking for that one
yeah i can imagine
yeah i can't remember his name either :)
yeah i can't tell why it's trying to connect to postgres 
yeah i checked it last night, works great
yeah i couldn't find anything out of the ordinary
yeah i did
yeah i did all that moto crap with NT emacs
yeah i did just to be safe
yeah i did that
yeah i did, actually
yeah i did, nobody in there 
yeah i did, that's what i'm talking about
yeah i didn't get that impression either... they are supposedly going to do it at some point
yeah i discovered my grocer's freezer section
yeah i do tags search for defvar
yeah i do that too
yeah i do. KD is on phone still
yeah i don't consider what we do extreme
yeah i don't respond to those EC errors anymore
yeah i don't see why it would have to happen now
yeah i don't think it should ever have NIL status
yeah i don't think it's that easy right now, but we could override it no problem
yeah i don't think that's a major hassle
yeah i don't think the differences between NT and 98 would affect golive
yeah i done seen it on friday
yeah i dont know too much current chicago house
yeah i dress in salvation army chic, depriving the homeless of the only clothes they can afford
yeah i dunno either
yeah i dunno how much of that i'd actually recommend quoting to customers
yeah i dunno if we should even bother trying to migrate them then huh
yeah i dunno why jesse likes it so much
yeah i edited it but it changed ... but that makes sense now that i seen man 5 shadow
yeah i figgerd
yeah i figure it's still too soon to start filing bugs on migration tho
yeah i figure since they have the data available for import we can easily move it all later if we hav to
yeah i figured
yeah i figured it would work
yeah i figured they were fullashit
yeah i figured, but like monthish?
yeah i filed that 
yeah i forget
yeah i forget the varname... holdon
yeah i found it
yeah i gently tell him it sux
yeah i get that too
yeah i ghink so
yeah i go nap and eat soup
yeah i got a 46 hour old session on my instance
yeah i got a few UI enh's from concordia too
yeah i got a pile of email
yeah i got gigahurtz tibook
yeah i got it
yeah i got one for that drawing pad and just pluggy pluggy the keyboard into it
yeah i got projex open for some updating today anyway
yeah i got that far...
yeah i got that impression
yeah i gotcha
yeah i gues
yeah i guess
yeah i guess 
yeah i guess dan found out yesterday that he's flying to LA today
yeah i guess i am too
yeah i guess i don't envy you
yeah i guess i meant support more than QA
yeah i guess i'm neither as exciting or romantic as some metalhead loser with needle tracks up his arm
yeah i guess it bears too much similarity to Goldfinger 
yeah i guess like 6-8 hours for that too
yeah i guess max doesn't know how to reopen
yeah i guess skeletor is ok
yeah i guess that's the fun of it is getting unlost
yeah i guess there's no micros out here...
yeah i guess we don't have lights 
yeah i guess you're probably right, the G-men thought police enforcement squads felt a thought crime was immanent
yeah i guess!
yeah i guess, 
yeah i had you in a tizzy for a second, i know
yeah i have it
yeah i have it up on my laptpop
yeah i have no idea what outlook did or maybe it's just a wack implementation of Gzip on the mac side
yeah i have no qualms about disabling it since there is an easy workaround
yeah i haven't lost a wallet since like 6th grade 
yeah i heard the distinctive sound of automatic weapons several times
yeah i heard they were not too hot live
yeah i hope
yeah i installed a bunch of shit in the past few days
yeah i just apt got that
yeah i just responded to the best of my abilites
yeah i just started useing gnus last week
yeah i keep forgetting to file that
yeah i kinda think you're right
yeah i knew that
yeah i knew that, i didn't know if they edited marc data in place or not
yeah i knew the poor girl in charge of booth assignments for World of Concrete... she was not exactly loving her job
yeah i knew they were 030's, my dad was raving about them around 1990 or so
yeah i kno
yeah i know
yeah i know adam
yeah i know but it also states that these fields have no logic nor integration with other parts of the application
yeah i know but the problem will recur unless we standardize
yeah i know but you have more control over who does
yeah i know dan knows that
yeah i know how that goes
yeah i know that
yeah i know the feeling
yeah i know what you talking aboot
yeah i know, but it has been a looonnngg time. like two min and still nothing
yeah i know, i got other things to work on 
yeah i know, we could announce that there is a minor issue that will cause civilian annoyance
yeah i knowit
yeah i like Ms. Fat Booty
yeah i like it
yeah i like it when things fix them selves
yeah i like money
yeah i love a free room at the Monte Carlo and a rack of chips in my room 
yeah i love to do that
yeah i mean the demo dataset must do something like that
yeah i meant just before migration then, but before compilation is better
yeah i needed to find lefty or mike
yeah i noticed
yeah i noticed i couldn't ssh in the other day
yeah i noticed that too
yeah i ran it on some kansas data
yeah i read all the challenger discussions on there ... 
yeah i read it the other day 
yeah i recorded all the bits with Sam Elliot
yeah i remember fixing it but i forget when
yeah i remember reading about it somewhere
yeah i remember that now, i felt all sorry for the line
yeah i remember uproar in my early english lit class upon finding the passage where the guy lets fly with the fart upon the friar
yeah i responde
yeah i restarted it
yeah i said it!
yeah i saw it
yeah i saw it download them yah
yeah i saw it was working on OS X too
yeah i saw that
yeah i saw that ... the utex stuff 
yeah i saw that note. Im looking for the Add_Delta_Days in the docs
yeah i saw that, but i don't have GNOME installed
yeah i saw your commit frenzy
yeah i see dat
yeah i should
yeah i should leave a note or something
yeah i still get lameo covad addresses
yeah i suppose
yeah i suppose that's probably ok
yeah i tailed some logs on prep and noticed it appending .onshroed.com to a lot of addresses
yeah i thik it is
yeah i think 2.0.6 is fine for the time being
yeah i think accompanying people are checkout center employees assigned to accompany the allocation then
yeah i think andy freivogel and ted gray could kick your techie butt to the moon
yeah i think having to spoof an IP adds more complexity to it
yeah i think he in a meetin
yeah i think he is not playing this time
yeah i think i got it... let's see
yeah i think i have to actually
yeah i think i remember her saying she was out today
yeah i think i remember that one
yeah i think it already has redhat on it
yeah i think it does
yeah i think it is resolved on the head
yeah i think it might be a UI thing
yeah i think it's a 7.2+ issue
yeah i think it's cool
yeah i think it's just one bug 
yeah i think it's the same deally yo
yeah i think it's their default browser now
yeah i think my band needs an image consultant or something
yeah i think of the thinkpad as my personal investment in the company
yeah i think so
yeah i think so but i'm not sure
yeah i think that's a decent solution
yeah i think that's all you should need right there, let your imagination do the rest
yeah i think that's the problem.  if he wants those huge limits, he has to deal with that slowness unforntunately
yeah i think that's what it's going to take
yeah i think they are
yeah i think they did ... 
yeah i think wdd is only allowed ftp access
yeah i think you are prolly right
yeah i think you do
yeah i think you're better off buying one new
yeah i those are screwed up
yeah i thought delete should always delete though
yeah i thought i did
yeah i thought lawrys was more expensive but i found the menu on line
yeah i thought so
yeah i thought so!
yeah i thought that might be the case
yeah i thought you would like that
yeah i tried to fwd it to webco-support
yeah i tried to run check-verioning and is started blowing up because it couldn't find oracle libs or something
yeah i used to be a programmer
yeah i usually do
yeah i wanna do an acoustic dealy with my boys and go up there
yeah i wanna see !!
yeah i want to get the full library of The Idea of North sometime
yeah i was a real cut-up
yeah i was curious if that was a bug or a feature
yeah i was having the problems in OSX all day  yesterday but only to certain hosts
yeah i was just about to be productive
yeah i was just thinking tht
yeah i was late
yeah i was really enjoying this one effect it was doing last nite ... it sounded like tinkly glass windchimes where before there were none :)
yeah i was sitting at home last night during the huge storm loving my wireless internet connection
yeah i was thinking of an iBook for precisely that reason
yeah i was thinking that... all that Makefile stuff confuses and bewilders me so i'm just monkeying on cafe.
yeah i was using ucb data with wco default patron classes
yeah i was watching the BBC last night
yeah i was wondering where that got to
yeah i was wondering why they played the president music when he came on
yeah i will
yeah i win
yeah i wish
yeah i wish we could fix it
yeah i wish we'd stop letting each customer design a little piece of the application 
yeah i wonder if we could fudge warp.lisp to give more informative errors
yeah i wore a sweater and a jacket
yeah i would guess it does
yeah i would need to know what error they are getting and what address they are trying 
yeah i would say HM is the best bet
yeah i would think so
yeah i wouldn't think it was
yeah i wouldn't want to be of middle eastern descent right now
yeah i wound up using query-replace, worked fine
yeah i wuz pissed off
yeah i'll check that once lisp works
yeah i'll do it now
yeah i'll get it
yeah i'll grab it
yeah i'll grep it
yeah i'll take a look at them
yeah i'll take a lookie
yeah i'll wait for craig to get it
yeah i'm Ring TFM
yeah i'm a dick
yeah i'm a tech support professional
yeah i'm big into the adult baby scene
yeah i'm curious about this whole protest thing...
yeah i'm doing that
yeah i'm full of great ideas
yeah i'm going to roll it back to jikes 1.13
yeah i'm hosting it off my tibook right now
yeah i'm in the media center or my apartmen
yeah i'm just going to play GTA4 in the dark
yeah i'm just going to stop answering the phone
yeah i'm kind of pissed about it because they told me it was until 2AM every night and then they were like ... 'oh well we changed your hours'
yeah i'm looking at the ATT Bband myself
yeah i'm not going to fix it on 2.0.10
yeah i'm not so hot on mr ashcrofts little agenda
yeah i'm not sure why you'd want to use a class that can only spawn 1 instance
yeah i'm not too hot on that idea
yeah i'm not too worried
yeah i'm on it
yeah i'm out... bye
yeah i'm pretty sure you can do that
yeah i'm recovering but slowly
yeah i'm rolling in bling
yeah i'm sure 
yeah i'm sure it will be fine 
yeah i'm thinking  i will ... not like they'll be able to get a line to my apartment but what the hell it's free 
yeah i'm thinking so
yeah i'm working on that now
yeah i've almost got it up
yeah i've done it
yeah i've heard some of their stuff, pretty cool ... like organ and drumbox and vocals right?
yeah if a tester doesn't know how to find release notes, they better start packin
yeah if i check out more items than will fit vertically on screen
yeah if i see that little fucker i'm feeding him to the cats
yeah if it's by either beck or radiohead
yeah if there is a dearth of other things to fix for 3.0 that might be a good one to promote
yeah if we all grab a chunk
yeah if we have a site in go live made...
yeah if you consider root type 1st level
yeah if you don't want it just don't pick it up silly
yeah if you get him talking about opera he cheers right up, unfortunately my domain of interaction with him has been enclosed within the scope of our vaporous application
yeah if you take it in cash, you will lose $150
yeah if you want to browse, just hit 'search' with no values
yeah if you would be so kind
yeah ill do that to elliinate it as a suspect
yeah im at the site
yeah imagine if only one person could fuck up allocation-core at once :)
yeah imagine that with like 32nd note metal clinky rhythms all over it
yeah imho it should never requeue if there is a wcof::error
yeah in my homedir on prep in the 7.2 directory 
yeah injuns for sure
yeah isaac made the video guy get an up close shot of one of the fat guys' package to explain why he chose their team
yeah it be ok...
yeah it breaks update-to-frozen if it's not there
yeah it builds
yeah it comes in handy don't it
yeah it could be improved plenty ...
yeah it could check the integrity of the tables or whatever
yeah it depends on whether you put it in '' or 
yeah it did change at some point
yeah it did the second time i ran it
yeah it does
yeah it doesn't hurt anything to leave it in
yeah it doesn't look like me
yeah it failed
yeah it got into 3.0.2
yeah it got the people dancing
yeah it happens sshing to strings from alpha and from skel
yeah it has to be fixed!!
yeah it helps to add all the filthy words you know to the dictionary
yeah it is
yeah it is just sara trying to pawn off her chores on me
yeah it is phenomenal
yeah it is post rock...
yeah it is!
yeah it just depends on how the parsing engine works
yeah it loaded, runtime error dutr
yeah it looks like dates aren't getting to the server
yeah it looks like he got it
yeah it looks like it
yeah it looks like it is jason
yeah it looks like it stops in the middle of the tinderbox info beeyatch
yeah it means you have new mail on queso, and it's not been grabbed by eudora yet
yeah it only applies to schools that use usage fees
yeah it rings rings rings, and then silence, and then the line goes dead
yeah it seems like it does
yeah it seems to definitely corrolate to stuff like fucked up auto-circs happening in worker threadsy
yeah it should be broken down by week or month probably
yeah it sounded so lame
yeah it sure looks like that doesn't it
yeah it sux trying to do support on outside webco instances too
yeah it usually draws a hiss or two from me daily
yeah it was all there, i watched
yeah it was at facets anyway
yeah it was cool 
yeah it was definitely a funky situation ... 
yeah it was for me too
yeah it was gelato 
yeah it was in 4.x but not 5.0
yeah it was just a guess
yeah it was kind of Airport 78 derivative
yeah it was like last april
yeah it was ok, no miller high life, mind you...
yeah it was packed
yeah it was quite a production
yeah it was trying to fucking userdel -r my account
yeah it went back in time and caused the extinction of the dinosaurs
yeah it would be nice to be able to rest on our laurels for a bit
yeah it would be nice to have configurable levels of verbosity in error logging... 
yeah it would be nice to have help menu feature eh?
yeah it would seem so
yeah it wuz good
yeah it' is not a big deal
yeah it'll take a while for headquarters to respond
yeah it's a bit groggy
yeah it's a bug
yeah it's a bug 
yeah it's a feature not a bug
yeah it's a total stel box
yeah it's all about the making clean
yeah it's all compiled and maked  and stuff
yeah it's all mixed up isn't it
yeah it's also translucent
yeah it's an IBM eServer i think
yeah it's an external package
yeah it's an older version of bugzilla
yeah it's been rather borked for a while
yeah it's bug material
yeah it's cool
yeah it's costly
yeah it's easy enough ... i've written cinapps-group-p and cinapps-person-p
yeah it's filed
yeah it's from 2 days a year ago
yeah it's fsking p3 enhancement
yeah it's fucked
yeah it's fun
yeah it's fun 
yeah it's got some good stuff on it
yeah it's hard to always know
yeah it's hard to sound enthusiastic
yeah it's in cmucl source
yeah it's kind of hectic today
yeah it's kind of the bottom of my stack
yeah it's like every other string is one of those 128 byte ^@ things
yeah it's like gone 2 seconds after its done
yeah it's like talking to adam on irc most of the time :)
yeah it's like that telephone game 
yeah it's listed on support site
yeah it's modwebapp
yeah it's named i think
yeah it's no biggy
yeah it's not 
yeah it's not hard
yeah it's not like it's high security
yeah it's not what i'd assume
yeah it's ok I guess
yeah it's ok cbl
yeah it's ok now
yeah it's okay but i still can't afford the gold rims for my lexus
yeah it's one of those slowpoke macintoshies
yeah it's our last chance isn't really a good excuse to dump untested code on our #1 superstar client
yeah it's pretty fucked over there
yeah it's really funny how everybody trashes electroclash here and then shells out $15 to go see that show
yeah it's really sucking hard this weekend
yeah it's so hard for me to sit here on my ass watching the world series and upgrading webco
yeah it's some deep down scheduling core deep voodoo
yeah it's something we've learned in the past dan
yeah it's time to go ayuh
yeah it's weird
yeah it's weird ... if i do it with a reservation it lets me confirm the reservation but won't let me pick it up
yeah it's working 
yeah its easier than the other way where i specify to change the image url
yeah its got a great modern rock sound track
yeah its working I'm almost finally done!
yeah java was kind of fun, but then i found CLOS
yeah jeez
yeah jeff
yeah jeff is in the houes
yeah jeffy, just trying to get this project site shite up
yeah jer is pointing out some reasonable flaws ... like checkout centers need to be able to close after midnite
yeah jesse is spamming lisp
yeah josh
yeah josh, I didn't find anything to change
yeah jr and jessica both got sick last week
yeah just being dense
yeah just the log error for me too
yeah just what i want to do
yeah just your normal everyday rocket attacks
yeah keep laughing ass holes...ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK!
yeah kelly's cute
yeah kinda crappy
yeah known i think
yeah later
yeah layers
yeah lee found a good one
yeah lee told me
yeah let's cash out 
yeah let's get that stupid beige piece of crap outta there and replace it with the iMac
yeah let's hope
yeah let's hope it comes thru
yeah let's see how it's doing around 6PM
yeah lets talk about Kant
yeah lif is massive
yeah like a subnet or something
yeah like adam yells at people for causing bugs
yeah like for each event_etime roll date back 4 hours
yeah like i didn't work at onshore then
yeah like low budget all in one scoring toolkit
yeah like opening up ssh would kill them
yeah like the person gets unemployed in the EC metadata cache but not in the DB or vice versa
yeah lisp is fine now
yeah listen in but not try to influence it
yeah look at the store-allocation funcs
yeah look where his salary is
yeah looking at it now
yeah looks fine
yeah looks like
yeah looks like -d does the trick *knock wood*
yeah looks pretty modern
yeah looks safe and happy
yeah lovely
yeah mac doesn't get blank frameset, they get Rtype Detail General frame in the whole frameset
yeah make some sanka
yeah make the onshore network stop sucking     
yeah makes sense
yeah man
yeah man I will be ok thne
yeah man, there's taco joints all over
yeah margin notes can come back to haunt you
yeah marshall field was not really the friend of the worker was he
yeah mary, pick up a damn sofa
yeah maybe instead of taking some crappy assistanceship i could hack lisp code for onShoreD
yeah maybe use something a little less common as the trigger ... like i'm staying late tonight to do some extra work on the app
yeah me
yeah me and my homeboy used to get bong supplies there
yeah me either
yeah me just find one!
yeah me neither
yeah me neither but the whole concept of an array is you can't just arbitrarily yank stuff out of it, right?
yeah me still sick
yeah me too
yeah me watched for a leetle
yeah migrating now
yeah millipedes are kind of cute in a buggy sort of way
yeah mine has low light mode
yeah mine too
yeah monica got sick at work and needed a ride
yeah mostly
yeah mr computer doesn't like serving the uploads
yeah mr kotter
yeah musta been my klutzy fingers clicking delete instead of save like a nincompoopoo
yeah muy
yeah my box
yeah my cd-rom drive died about 6 mo. ago.. I think those machines have weak ones...
yeah my dad used to make pasta at home
yeah my fingers bounce off the keyss
yeah my glutes are rock solid :)
yeah my mama turned me onto them!!
yeah need any sumer interns?
yeah netscape sucks donger
yeah netscape table rendery sucky sucky
yeah netstat -at shows listening on localhost:5550
yeah nevermind
yeah new bot feature
yeah next time he'll be extra courteous
yeah nice smack craig
yeah nice!
yeah nigz, I got it goin on!
yeah no confirmation
yeah no dice
yeah no doubt
yeah no gpm
yeah no more i gotta buy the whole new Eminem record because one song is good
yeah no porb
yeah no prob silk right?
yeah no shit
yeah nobody is here
yeah nobody uses it right?
yeah nobody would steal for cocaine
yeah non free is ok if it isn't microsoft...and billable..
yeah not GnR
yeah not so good
yeah nothing like fibromialgia AND opiate withdrawal
yeah now I can't even get im
yeah now he's pretty hung up on webcheckout
yeah now that might be a bug
yeah now wait though... check this out
yeah now we're talking
yeah of course
yeah of course 
yeah ok
yeah ok .. right
yeah ok utah was fixed this morning
yeah ok, what about URI?  
yeah okay
yeah old wailers rock 
yeah on it
yeah on restore it does
yeah once i switched from tty emacs to x emacs it was ok...
yeah one moment happy the next sad - something to do with the computer I guess
yeah one of the original traders
yeah only on the download
yeah opus full of trix
yeah or something like that
yeah or that
yeah or they get lots of pickups or returns at multiplle checkout centers between 10 and 11 or whenever they say it happens.
yeah other systems are tagged
yeah paperwork
yeah planes are breeding grounds for sick
yeah please
yeah please do
yeah please fix that
yeah pls do
yeah por thing
yeah port seems correct 
yeah post
yeah postgres sucks butt
yeah prada is pretty out these days
yeah prep is running way in the red zone
yeah pretty good
yeah pretty much
yeah printing
yeah probably
yeah probably not.. 
yeah probably, because people are going to be getting charged
yeah probly
yeah prollably
yeah prolly
yeah prolly like 808-->filter-->verb
yeah prolly right
yeah prolly ucb
yeah ps faux claims it's adduser
yeah pserver is blocked 
yeah public schools!
yeah pull an amelia bedelia on him
yeah read my response...
yeah really
yeah really dude, you can start answering webco-support emails if you think you can do a better job 
yeah really, when the dongle was a 20 pound analog drum machine
yeah reason is definitely more fun than webcheckout
yeah redhat
yeah reported on 2.0.9.2
yeah resource detail
yeah restart the server
yeah return search still returns results in wrong frame
yeah righ
yeah right
yeah right ... sounds like its gonna be every man for himself on toilet paper huh
yeah right now it's obviously stonerated
yeah right. you are funny jk
yeah right...
yeah safe bet
yeah saic
yeah same here
yeah same here... the italics in the inset box
yeah same screen
yeah same size...
yeah scp is encrypted and not as succeptible as ftp
yeah see a weekly self-diagnostic would bee good
yeah see if you can break it
yeah see lee's email
yeah see you tomorrow
yeah see...
yeah seems like a long shot
yeah seems likely
yeah seen that
yeah server horked woould qualify as unusual
yeah she banged the drummer
yeah she does
yeah she is all about nonprofit stuff
yeah she is there every night
yeah she was kvetching about that on sat...
yeah shes home
yeah shit
yeah shoot
yeah short answer of course they will see a performance increase
yeah should be pretty easy
yeah shut up josh
yeah si
yeah since it's just on 12 ain't no teens ripping MP3 
yeah slap 2.0.9 on that one 
yeah so i heard
yeah so now he has no debit card or credit  card
yeah so?
yeah some luck
yeah some of that stuff came off 4 track, some was mixed directly into the computer live from the mixing board
yeah some servers are worse than others
yeah some sort of bottle neck never mind
yeah some stoner working on the code no doubt...
yeah somebody from NorVergence came by
yeah something like that
yeah somethings gotta be screwy there
yeah somethings sucky in internet land
yeah sometimes that is a nice change from cologne techno
yeah somewhat
yeah sorry
yeah sorry...
yeah sounds good
yeah staff requires approval
yeah standard is preferrable
yeah starting in 13 months
yeah still waiting
yeah superfriends!
yeah sure
yeah sure 
yeah sure go git it 
yeah sure i'll come visit you
yeah sure, i will disable all the tests that fail so you can look at pretty green table cell :)
yeah sure, i'll do an old-school server-style isntall
yeah sure... we can just redefine the #'print-lpr func
yeah sux is relative
yeah system errors does it
yeah team nicky
yeah tell him we'll look into it
yeah test test 
yeah thanks boss - without you I am nothing
yeah that
yeah that LDate thing was causing a lot of shi
yeah that UI stuff only pulls up the WCO groups ... there are basically 2 functions i still need to write yet
yeah that always helps
yeah that auto-cache idea is probably subtly suicidal
yeah that chapman thing looks like a 3.0 import boog
yeah that contains master beta information
yeah that desc is good
yeah that granular shit is so 1999 
yeah that is really wack!
yeah that is sales
yeah that is the ever popular conflicting reservations bug
yeah that looks like a transient error
yeah that looks like it
yeah that makes sense
yeah that might be a good idea
yeah that might be it
yeah that one I got
yeah that safari browser is pretty decent
yeah that seems best ... i dunno what else has gone into 3.0.2 at this point anyway
yeah that seems pretty common on redhat
yeah that should do it
yeah that sounds right
yeah that stupid mit spinoff company's software rides it
yeah that sucks
yeah that sux in RH
yeah that was a good movie man...
yeah that was a thought
yeah that was going around i guess
yeah that was pooey
yeah that was sales' call
yeah that was the looky here h ross perot bug
yeah that was the real name
yeah that works fine
yeah that would be cool
yeah that would be good
yeah that would be my guess
yeah that would help
yeah that would probably do it
yeah that's  operation tourist strip-search 
yeah that's a bug
yeah that's a funny term isn't it
yeah that's a good idea too
yeah that's a good point. 
yeah that's a new one
yeah that's a safe bet
yeah that's a thought
yeah that's a toughy
yeah that's better
yeah that's called a 'drop-off'
yeah that's clear...i see my job as just a color change at a certain point
yeah that's cool, it's just that now when a new loc-sched node is created it has no pointer to it's regime
yeah that's cute
yeah that's dirty
yeah that's fine
yeah that's fun 
yeah that's handy
yeah that's how i found out about it originally
yeah that's in progress
yeah that's it
yeah that's it, lots of good drive names then
yeah that's kinda bogus
yeah that's lame
yeah that's my guess
yeah that's my next plan
yeah that's one way to get the pussy
yeah that's our mascot ... a resource-delivering platypus who speaks in king james english
yeah that's postgres
yeah that's pretty gross gracchus
yeah that's pretty informative
yeah that's probably 'resource unavailable'
yeah that's prolly the break thing 
yeah that's really how it works in the app anyway
yeah that's right
yeah that's right they added a bunch of stuff inbetween those didn't they
yeah that's right they have fuxy proxy
yeah that's sucky
yeah that's the ServerName directive
yeah that's the easy way :)
yeah that's the next step 
yeah that's the one
yeah that's true
yeah that's usually what they say 
yeah that's weird
yeah that's weird ... i see it too
yeah that's what i chose
yeah that's what i got
yeah that's what i told don
yeah that's what i was getting at 
yeah that's what i was thinking
yeah that's what she said
yeah that's what the hyperspec said
yeah the Beebmeister kics fuckin arse
yeah the CVS conflict let me konw
yeah the OO patterns class, but not a lisp class
yeah the ai kid
yeah the art direction was really great
yeah the bot starts whining if gracchus slaps him around too much
yeah the bug is just that the error is not pretty 
yeah the checkbox is missing and defaulted on in 2.0.x
yeah the clicksncuts comp is pretty hit or miss
yeah the defvar-function defines, push a note on the symbol plist
yeah the disk sounds jolly :)
yeah the dog butt was pretty much a good summary of the show
yeah the dog that greeted us was very nice too
yeah the error is reasonable
yeah the flo barrista dutr
yeah the generated ones
yeah the guy was doing it on an escalator!
yeah the guys from tortoise were decimating her liquor cabinet too
yeah the insert error is the real problem here
yeah the internet is, like, so two years ago
yeah the irony is there
yeah the kakes are in the jewels in chicago...
yeah the look like little poos
yeah the name is a subterfuge
yeah the networks are in chaos
yeah the nice thing about doing it on 3.0.x is it requires less branch jumping
yeah the only things i tried were changing the administrator password and creating a custom command to restart webcheckout
yeah the only times i've worked outside was doing audio sequencing with logic
yeah the photos are where they shine ... fatwah boy slim ... sheesh
yeah the problem is it's like statistically sparse ... like 1 in 500 allocations on SAIC
yeah the problem with OS X is that there is NO software for it yet
yeah the red and yellow look awful .. much better in rot und gelb
yeah the site is good
yeah the sound just shot up those shafts - keeping entire dorm awake!
yeah the test package takes a helluva long time to compile
yeah the unpopular military ruling party declared their support but there's not exactly a groundswell of support by the masses
yeah the update-to-head script rebuilds the applet
yeah the whole world just really sucks i guess
yeah then tell him to remove Camera as root type on all those screwy ones and we should be fine
yeah then you said you were gonna update gnumeric
yeah there are two types of women
yeah there is something shitty going on with chicago routing
yeah there must be one func that switches the time format from local-time or wall-time to integer 
yeah there was one chekbox on allocation confirm screen for Pickup
yeah there was some other really funny stuff there too
yeah there were some other dirs that used to do that too
yeah there you go
yeah there's a big 'raw food' movement
yeah there's all this allocation rendering stuff in find-activity-form so all i had to do was hook up a find-allocation-logs search to it and woowoo here we got some allocation logs
yeah there's no way to tell configure where httpd.conf is
yeah there's the rub
yeah theres a bunch of joneses
yeah they are 3V1L
yeah they are all over the city
yeah they are all spoiled rich kids
yeah they are as you descibe... 
yeah they are back up
yeah they are block heads
yeah they are fine
yeah they are going to love being down for 2 days for the 3.0 upgrade
yeah they are lame
yeah they are logged
yeah they are using it
yeah they close at like 7 or 8
yeah they do
yeah they got bought out like everybody else
yeah they have
yeah they have a lot of crap 
yeah they have some really good songs
yeah they hunted down the cow with the full might of the US military too
yeah they just have to retrain their users that printout does not signify success
yeah they just like to ask ask ask ask ask
yeah they pay her lots of dough
yeah they pretty morose
yeah they really shred live from what i hear
yeah they rebooted it 1.5 hours ago
yeah they rule
yeah they sound like a joy to deal with
yeah they told pam 30 minutes about 18 hours ago
yeah they were worried they wouldn't get good enough clearance
yeah they're good friends of mine; you're making me miss people
yeah they're rolling in the sheriffs busses
yeah things are getting kind of pokey 
yeah this guys a real catch
yeah this is a pain
yeah this is true, sometimes the mind wanders
yeah this one is just half-assed ... stuffy head and sore throat ... but it still blows
yeah this one is not from pyro mania 
yeah this one particular thing has been biting my ass since the last millenium though
yeah those are the friends. must sleep now
yeah those bike people like to dis the cars
yeah those brits, they serve it up warm and curdy
yeah those keyboards suck farts
yeah those look pretty anal to me
yeah tht's kind of an overstatement
yeah to both
yeah tomorrow, i'm tired of typing 
yeah too bad we fired her whole family
yeah too many cooks
yeah total canal banana
yeah totallly
yeah totally
yeah totally awesome
yeah totally hot
yeah tried taht
yeah true
yeah try doing a semester's worth of repeat reservations for 40 resources
yeah trying to clean up loc schedule
yeah turbo
yeah turntables are outselling guitars these days
yeah txpdr interface is pretty abstracted from alloc-core
yeah typecase i think
yeah um
yeah umm why don't we order at ll:30
yeah understand
yeah update that
yeah use 5208
yeah use a with-lexical-session and with-wcof-session pair like you would in the tests
yeah usually he calls me
yeah wahtever
yeah wahtever get back to work geek
yeah watch ch 2
yeah watching full metal jacket with the family...
yeah we are
yeah we begged them
yeah we burn some real rubber later eh?
yeah we do
yeah we got to figure out how to get rich off software
yeah we gots some testing to do
yeah we gotta change that doc
yeah we had aboog in the init skript
yeah we have a lot of bugs that are really hard to reproduce
yeah we have development on all machines basically
yeah we hung out for a while at the party
yeah we might be able to get that for 2.0.9
yeah we need to get those 2 together
yeah we should bill them hourly for that
yeah we should have a big candy dish full of valium
yeah we should have a login-screen.lisp or something
yeah we should have a secret shut-down-nicely webmethod
yeah we should move some tags
yeah we specifically webco to obey TZ on the server
yeah we're better off getting a new suck^H^H^H^Htester every release
yeah we're rolling in it alright
yeah we've got plenty of money
yeah webcheckout is now hereditarily slow
yeah weird bug no?
yeah weird, eh?
yeah well
yeah well 
yeah well - haev interview tomorrow so should be ok
yeah well ... look at microsoft
yeah well 2 years after i felt that way i still feel ignorant
yeah well I am flat broke now... but I will look into in.
yeah well I just got it so I thought to psot
yeah well be nicer to mr. clucky in the future 
yeah well confirm is now just a button and not so much a screen
yeah well for future reference, we CAN deal with server maintenance without root but it's a pain
yeah well given my tolerance for hippies i'll probably show up long enough to get interviewed by the TV news, get some nice NO WAR buttons and then skedaddle
yeah well i don't think much of hardcore ravers or their scene 
yeah well i guess if tbox is thrashing then the include fails or whatever
yeah well i have the name of whoever whatever if you want it
yeah well i'm not gonna take gordon up on the offer unless onshore folds or something
yeah well i'm one of those new world men
yeah well if i don't show up with the right people i may not get in
yeah well if they can figure out who to hit you know they will
yeah well it seems i am having trouble understanding how to do that... karl's terse documentation is not very specific
yeah well it should be
yeah well it's going to suck to sit thru migrating 3458965669239872334689256235 log entries in webcheckout 5.0 
yeah well it's going to take longer for us to fix it than it is for them to re-enter it
yeah well look around.. doesn't get much more unreal than what going on these days
yeah well mine has cold day old shrimp so ha
yeah well she wound up with a real catch i guess
yeah well something is fucked up at baylor anyway
yeah well that would be a start really
yeah well that's neal stephenson for you
yeah well that's the best way to do it really
yeah well the known problems, though... 
yeah well the one i saw on there was incompletely picking them up i think
yeah well the other thing to take into consideration is if att does it, so will the other guys
yeah well the road to chuck e cheese is paved with good intentions
yeah well the schools that really need it are the ones with no sysadmins
yeah well there's a mylex raid controller and an lvd disk lying around
yeah well this time we mean it!
yeah well we have rewritten usage fees before too
yeah well we still remember that crack about the city 'burned down by a cow'
yeah well we're having a really awesome rainy october afternoon here so you can keep your stupid beach 
yeah well whatever and stuff
yeah well when my teletype is down i have to use one of those flashy-lantern things from a ship
yeah well when you have programmers design the UI...
yeah well why don't we worry about this once we have 1) a stable working network 2) 3.0 ready to go
yeah well you will if you start to dump loads, and loads, and loads of your money into it 
yeah werird
yeah what a
yeah what a bummer to be an unregulated monopoly
yeah what about strontium 90
yeah what about the tag - wco_release_2_0_9 or wco_release_2_0_9_1?
yeah what browser are you using
yeah what could possibly be wrong with the app?
yeah what do you think i am, an assreader?
yeah what is with americans always blowing up allies
yeah what the fuck is that
yeah what the hell, we've violated the box in every other way possible :)
yeah what up beeyatch
yeah what up with that
yeah what's his #
yeah what's that going to look like on an imac screen at 800x600
yeah what's the proB?
yeah whatever
yeah whatever hippie
yeah whatever... already talked to the cops :)
yeah wheaton is fixed, i just tested it
yeah wheaton was looking for the dump today
yeah when I try to be funy u better wach out
yeah when is 1423.3 gonna be done
yeah when one is horking one can only hope to make one's time yes...
yeah whichever
yeah while anyway dude programmed the coolest bits of eiffel in like 200 lines of lisp code
yeah white emacs is a plague on society
yeah who
yeah who cares..
yeah whole checklist, start to finish, add more stuff if you think of it
yeah why can't SAIC just set their grace period to 0 minutes? problem solved
yeah why not
yeah why not give them a call and reinforce
yeah windows cost like $140 or something
yeah with horseradish if they have it
yeah woo dat?
yeah word
yeah word to that
yeah would be nice
yeah would it be a clever gag if i left my head at home
yeah would you please?  i'm trying to fix it now but it's nice to have a bug to close to give me the feeling of a job well done
yeah wow
yeah wtf
yeah yah
yeah yah! I'm back in Chelsea!
yeah yeah
yeah yeah break out the S-Club 7
yeah yeah get to the sister compliments
yeah yeah i'll get to it
yeah yeah its dumm and stupi
yeah yeah like that
yeah yeah that's what i said
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah, I know. But they give me quick and dirty backup when I'm rushing around from place to place.
yeah yeah, i'm reading my buffer
yeah yeah, me go vegas
yeah yeah, that's what I meant ;)
yeah yeah, we know that
yeah yeah... me editing...
yeah yer lucky
yeah you are correct, I just assumed one
yeah you are right
yeah you can
yeah you can do that 
yeah you can ssh tunnel or whatever
yeah you can tell which drugs were named by the 2nd string guys
yeah you can type in color with that i think
yeah you can't take nice looking pictures with anything under $2000
yeah you could strain a ligament
yeah you did
yeah you do
yeah you do :)
yeah you do!
yeah you got an answer?
yeah you gotta assert the dominance
yeah you gotta be fresh for the good people of webcheckout land
yeah you have to buy NT for the club remix
yeah you have to change the owner and then accept the bug
yeah you know that pam
yeah you might wanna go pick  up a copy of symantec or something
yeah you must
yeah you should check out fink too
yeah you should just restart it
yeah you suck
yeah you thug
yeah you won't find jack
yeah you'd think
yeah you'll be the only  one
yeah you're just too smart
yeah you're penciled in on the 3rd floor dude
yeah you're right
yeah youre probably right
yeah!
yeah! also extra charge for making me reinstall director on skeletor
yeah! ask Jeff Bezos!
yeah! casual day
yeah! come git it!
yeah! dan uses netscape, he's no dumy
yeah! fuckem!
yeah! get a job!
yeah! instant replay!
yeah! salesforce smackdown! boo yah!
yeah! that's it!!!
yeah! trade show! 
yeah! you go boys! 
yeah!!! showed you!
yeah!!!!11
yeah!!...
yeah,  i should get out a coupla hundred just in case :)
yeah, 'scool.
yeah, --system=redhat or whatever
yeah, 1.2 not supported in netscape
yeah, 1.8.7 from 6:25 this morning
yeah, 2
yeah, 2036 too
yeah, 205
yeah, 3574 is valid
yeah, 6you're right
yeah, :)
yeah, Back to Top
yeah, CK 2513 and CK2516 conflict, cancel 2516 please
yeah, DSL
yeah, Dan & I have sold $100k to two privates in the last few weeks
yeah, I am going to explain how renew works and then ask him the purpose of needing it to remove resources from current checkout, after he replies we will explain to him how he is crazy to want such a thing
yeah, I am on it already...
yeah, I am too busy with more important stuff to do that by that time
yeah, I can still fire up the old one under clhttp.
yeah, I could smoke em' in like, a week
yeah, I did that with cs.uchicago.edu
yeah, I didn't think Laune == freak
yeah, I don't like how Debian does it's network setup ... but it's better than redhats.  Actually, come to think of it, there aren't a lot of os' whose networking setup i like
yeah, I don't see how the script can help the fact that the modem keeps disconnecting
yeah, I don't think I could actually produce much just yet
yeah, I get to spend 10 minutes waiting for level1 tech support!
yeah, I going to make you.
yeah, I got that part
yeah, I gotta go to and do some file-system maint
yeah, I gotta work with rbleib and get the timing on cafe set properly
yeah, I guess it can get pretty hairy when you have to do several all at once.
yeah, I guess it's good to upgrade apache anyway
yeah, I guess seeing one of your parishoners going up like a torch would get your attention
yeah, I guess.  The lack of ready at hand hand guns here .. seems there are more stabbings, blugeonings and burnings as a result.
yeah, I had a brief talk with Eric and officers mtgs
yeah, I had a whole row and I slept
yeah, I had dinner with your mom last night.
yeah, I heard it was pretty nice in chitown today
yeah, I heard ya
yeah, I just had to rerun silo...
yeah, I know
yeah, I know jess
yeah, I know that bit... that's for the proper 302 redirection
yeah, I know we don't use it i was just thinking the install would barf without the argument
yeah, I know, I asked him the day before and on friday :)  but he keeps sending us stuff 
yeah, I lost a lot of mail today
yeah, I may get a cell for business if I can't split...
yeah, I ran to the bank and the deed was done
yeah, I read the Gentle introduction to Haskell paper
yeah, I read the white goddess this year .. had to get a tree
yeah, I see it's in applet mode now
yeah, I see that...
yeah, I sorta stuck some stuff into wco that I wasn't sure belonged where I put them
yeah, I think I forgot how to write cursive anything...
yeah, I think I sent you part nose
yeah, I think it comes in as hme0 on my ultra5 too
yeah, I think josh is working that out, the subnet stuff, right?
yeah, I think those are a good idea
yeah, I thought about it but decided bad idea
yeah, I thought it was fucking fun
yeah, I thought there might be a way but ill just restart. it kinda seemed wrong but no biggie
yeah, I want to rock you on Rebirth
yeah, I was cornfused
yeah, I was enjoying that too.
yeah, I was just being a prink
yeah, I was just fixing some final things
yeah, I was talking about entity tables
yeah, I will be in..
yeah, I wondered about that
yeah, I worry there may be many claps out there
yeah, I wouldnt really see a movie in the theater just for that
yeah, I'd like to stop by there too.
yeah, I'll be here a bit.
yeah, I'll brb... I need a break then I'll finish up the textual thing
yeah, I'll leave y'all alone...
yeah, I'll let you know what kind of rpm emerges from the bowels of alien
yeah, I'll let you know when I need an exit... 
yeah, I'm a hardass, esp. when I get to abuse a phone company
yeah, I'm getting a lot of real world experience at onshore
yeah, I'm now good...
yeah, I'm seeing that
yeah, I'm thinking the latter
yeah, I'm used to grief in my life @:)
yeah, I've had my crosses to bear...
yeah, I've had some fun with elisp
yeah, I've heard much of it
yeah, I've noticed :-)
yeah, I've tripped the alarm and don't know the code...
yeah, Im at home right now
yeah, MERRILY
yeah, MS Query can access the data source
yeah, Martin Gretschmann aka Console
yeah, Mattias was asking me
yeah, Max is Opcode
yeah, NWS
yeah, STCC reporteth
yeah, Sinfield was the lyricist for King Crimson, so an ELP connection is probable
yeah, a bit
yeah, a date relative to the beginning of time
yeah, a hoot ainnit
yeah, a little... he was doing some consulting
yeah, a lot of things get announced ;)
yeah, a riot
yeah, adam - glad to hear from you!
yeah, adam claimed it was because it was a distinct query, so i patched usql to allow non-distinct defqueries, and wrote find-allocations-2 which is non-distinct, and the report still takes 9.893333e+7 microseconds per 100 reservations
yeah, adam helped and pointed me to a couple things
yeah, adam's going to whip my ass 
yeah, all i really meant is not lisp.
yeah, all these internet users, speaking in coded messages, hatching plans, machinating machinations ... it's downright sinister if you ask me
yeah, all those little 2-3 k's add up
yeah, all those music biz fuckers are
yeah, alot easier than in bangkok
yeah, alot of it looks like its' partially done already
yeah, alpha got bum rushed 
yeah, already vouched for
yeah, although I think the you're not gonna need it rule flies in the face of a lot of OOSWE tenets
yeah, and I said so
yeah, and I want it to show up as 1999 revenue since it was done in 1999 :)
yeah, and I'll bet the dept of health gets more strangeness than the phone sex lines
yeah, and a harley
yeah, and guess what, it's causing problems
yeah, and he said twice how much he liked the demo
yeah, and i'm giving out candy tonight
yeah, and it freaked the hell out of me when it got it
yeah, and it's a big bleeding mess
yeah, and not pretentious
yeah, and only used on AOL chats :)
yeah, and open until 10pm their time
yeah, and reinitialize-instance
yeah, and the urinal cake mouse as well
yeah, and the whole local-time thing causes a bit of a headache with all the instances
yeah, and there's a reader macro which would explain the lack of grep hits
yeah, and those prentice hall lisp books
yeah, and throw poop at the admins
yeah, and un commitable
yeah, and you don't get paid a dime for it
yeah, aph... there are examples in the file
yeah, apop
yeah, around methods really call that into question
yeah, artcenter is getting leasing set up which will then get us po
yeah, as if there is any proof they actually listened to me talk for 13 hours a day! poop heads
yeah, as in I like to be paid @:)
yeah, ask her to sign off please
yeah, ask on irc :)
yeah, asker
yeah, at 1407... but I saw 1423
yeah, at least not at a reasonable rate
yeah, at least you have a window :P
yeah, at onshore we have a couple of big meetings to determine plan of action, etc.
yeah, at the start of ch.11
yeah, auth.eps is commented out...  that one should die
yeah, awwl dat
yeah, back to 1988
yeah, bad mike
yeah, basically i think we've hit this bug every time daylight savings time has changed in the past 2 years
yeah, because he's never going to get a chick with lines like that and then he's just going to have more anger towards them
yeah, been there done that.
yeah, before the next 2.0.x patch yah
yeah, better than >10 seconds for sure
yeah, better. Im slowly getting some changes around here tho. At lewast they are open to ideas. mainly hard to convince them that the time is better spent in the beggining rather thanlater
yeah, big mess... well, you can of course steal the files or just overlay them from what was tar'd into misleb's dir
yeah, bill and I talked to him pretty regularly
yeah, blows
yeah, bowie stays on top of things
yeah, bril with a nice scots accent could be quite a hoot
yeah, bug #4987
yeah, bug 5016
yeah, but I asked if they see any of the drop downs under fees and fines and they don't see them, i'll get the screen shot if the reboot doesn't work
yeah, but I didn't get your email, weird, I'll check again
yeah, but I didn't know {} was smart enough to recognize context, instead of just using the scalar value of the array ref
yeah, but I don't know of a relay that will accept me
yeah, but I'm going to make a few more trips over there today.
yeah, but I've only got a keyboard to work with
yeah, but SI keeps stealing them
yeah, but accd has a cooler box
yeah, but always heavy use. there's prolly something wrong
yeah, but approved is automatically set to ANY
yeah, but back to question one: how to I change the install target? 
yeah, but craigl was able to handle the ish
yeah, but first i want to file a P1 Blocker about it
yeah, but good dirty
yeah, but he wasn't
yeah, but he's become predictable
yeah, but i already told them that...don't worry about it...i'll lay it out for her and then if she freaks out, we'll deal with it from there
yeah, but i am using bitchx on jk's machine at home
yeah, but i can't remember how or when he died
yeah, but i want to see who could log in remotely
yeah, but i'm being challenged more specifically and i'm not smart enough to knw the answer
yeah, but i'm doing the development on LInux, so what works in Netscape 4.7 on Linux may or may not work in Netscape 4.7 on the Mac and vice versa
yeah, but isn't cron on 24 hour time?
yeah, but it did get critics choice last week, it was cute and light
yeah, but it must be hard to have to keep on such a similar thing for so long
yeah, but it wasn't in the applet, it let me move the bars over a yellow reserved time without pulling it back like it normally would, then I hit commit and then got the error
yeah, but it wouldn't sound as good ... he gets really good sound from that neotek
yeah, but it's keeping the chickens away
yeah, but itz a big one...has some kind of objct database
yeah, but maybe they haven't plugged it in yet
yeah, but not enough evidently
yeah, but not guaranteed available on wco boxes
yeah, but opus doesn't have raph's cell #
yeah, but since you'll be at work tomorrow, right?, you can answer it then
yeah, but that would just prevent the resource being added to the allocation altogether, not an incomplete object
yeah, but that's 3 words
yeah, but that's lossy...
yeah, but the code is already there
yeah, but the condition that caused it to blow up was ...
yeah, but the last 8 minutes are spent sitting in traffic 1 block away...
yeah, but the phorbes be diggin it
yeah, but the screens are *inside* the windows
yeah, but then we need to find time servers
yeah, but then you end up taking advantage of yourself
yeah, but there was supposed to be a 17-year gap between bilbo's birthday and frodo leaving bag-end
yeah, but they might provide some clues
yeah, but they were doing the form elements and they didn't want to muck with layers
yeah, but they were from boston, not new york!
yeah, but this one isn't in Notes
yeah, but those were before, this is now
yeah, but to really look like a genius you have to do the smacking with a very intent look on your face
yeah, but wait a year and see how simple it is
yeah, but we get complaints about 2 patrons missing
yeah, but we gotta wait until 2004 to find out
yeah, but what's the forward slash at the end?
yeah, but without strict there's not much point
yeah, but you're going to kill me
yeah, butusually for older models 
yeah, call them the trouble maker province 
yeah, can't opus do that for her? opus, brew coffee
yeah, can't replicate that header bullshit anymore
yeah, cant get it up ;)
yeah, cause it does those steps for you
yeah, checks are rolling in
yeah, chiyoko, i know...i just wanted something relatively cheep that we could put together ourselves
yeah, christmas in july would be cool
yeah, classic is actually pretty effective
yeah, combs don't do it for me
yeah, come over and rock out with us at 1423
yeah, commit, please.
yeah, congrats on putting your hand through whatever you had to put it through to get your red stripe
yeah, cool huh
yeah, could not be interrupted, but it did not disappeart
yeah, could you?
yeah, craig told me a bit about UnCommonSQL
yeah, craig was raving about it @:)
yeah, craig, I like the way the wizard is looking too
yeah, craig.  we are constantly being sweated by the man
yeah, dag what with the dame? was she showing off some gamsx?
yeah, database on alpha is poopy
yeah, dawn and I walked by when he was drawing
yeah, definitely
yeah, destroying our nice carpet with that horrible weapon
yeah, dick!
yeah, did MS buy out NYPD or something?  
yeah, did a half-hearted search; found nothing
yeah, did you have to do that on the head?
yeah, did you type the html tags into the layout window in golive?
yeah, do a split
yeah, do a traceroute -- we're going thru Cleveland
yeah, do the new colors
yeah, do you want them revealed?
yeah, don't be bored around kathleen ... she might break you in half 
yeah, don't change anything.
yeah, don't do that
yeah, don't you remember me telling you we had to log all changes
yeah, drink beer with us tonight?
yeah, dude told me of it in the email
yeah, dude, automake is another world ... a world of debugging impossiblity
yeah, eayh
yeah, ed norton's character wasn't developed enuf
yeah, eric talked to them today adn they didn't have a heavy usage day
yeah, especially cause they used this groovy Love song
yeah, especially considering how many pieces of HUGE construction equipment we had to get in and out of the Las Vegas convo center
yeah, even 10usd
yeah, even enteracts dns doesnt have it
yeah, event model very finicky across platforms
yeah, exactly
yeah, except a friend is somebody you actually hang out with because you *like* them
yeah, file as production instance and put [URI] in the subject line
yeah, focus PLZ!
yeah, forgot that
yeah, free candy
yeah, friday
yeah, from k westbrook
yeah, g-funk latin went out with hammer pants
yeah, gbg and hardware were not the best match
yeah, geek humor and patriotism mix so well
yeah, geez
yeah, get a full list of the pages we did and we'll look that over
yeah, give #2 a bump up...
yeah, go and work
yeah, go get em tiger
yeah, go to it d3wd
yeah, good call
yeah, good luck with getting JR to understand that :)
yeah, got it
yeah, got that
yeah, got the spare in the mail
yeah, got to *finally* learn some new moovz last night
yeah, green loogies are the coolest
yeah, gunzip baby
yeah, half the time people want to be able to reserve in the past
yeah, handler-case
yeah, he already popped on open on the phone... was inspiring
yeah, he does often wander around with a dazed look, mumbling where's my mister kitty?
yeah, he immediately starts mixing meanings
yeah, he just needs to work on his reporting demeanor
yeah, he let me off though because Im using clos as my lang of choice and no one else is
yeah, he planned it real good
yeah, he pointed me right at it right before he left
yeah, he probably has hands
yeah, he said he would discuss it with you guys though
yeah, he talks about evil trial lawyers and they show john edwards
yeah, he was like you work with UofC alums so you must know how we are
yeah, he's doing a little recording
yeah, he's even got a nice icon if you have a mac :)
yeah, he's pumped.  I saw his picture on the bugzilla page
yeah, he's reading
yeah, he's really improving!
yeah, he's still repackaging whatever's currently underground and pretending like he made it up
yeah, healthy employees are so expensive
yeah, heaps of it! egga rolla, soupa 'n' chicken
yeah, hell could be a 24 hour barry manilow and carpenters marathon
yeah, her!
yeah, here it is before editing:
yeah, here too
yeah, hip hop is really pan-racial and global
yeah, how did you get it?
yeah, how lame. it translates almost correctly
yeah, i actually drive up to dominicks rather than walk 2 blocks to jewel half the time 
yeah, i actually had to play guitar with her while she was performing them
yeah, i always do it manually
yeah, i am not positive i understand how post-action is called
yeah, i can click on reservations
yeah, i can do potato from here too
yeah, i can kind of understand why it does that
yeah, i can't think of a reason why they wouldn't
yeah, i checked in brozefsky style at 6 last night
yeah, i considered utah a pre-release anyways
yeah, i could see that
yeah, i did. I was just curious how that worked
yeah, i didn't really know though, i assumed
yeah, i didn't think so
yeah, i do, doing them now
yeah, i don't get section 6 either...well, i get a and b, but why we're supposed to de~scribe their process for internal review is weird and odd
yeah, i don't know what to do about that... i wish we had the luxury of being able to stop developing new features until the scheduling-core and transaction code was rock solid
yeah, i don't know why she didn't want to come to onshore
yeah, i don't think baylor's in production or anything 
yeah, i don't think it should block 2.0.4 
yeah, i don't think so
yeah, i don't understand why any one would want to remove a resource from a current checkout
yeah, i don;'t care 
yeah, i done got it
yeah, i dont' see it here
yeah, i figured something like that
yeah, i figured we could do it
yeah, i forgot i turned up debug level
yeah, i got a func to do that in log.lisp
yeah, i got a little script
yeah, i got a whole comp on skeletor
yeah, i got it all fresh in me noggin
yeah, i got it back to the listener for a second 
yeah, i got lots of complaints from users
yeah, i got no reply
yeah, i got props tho for being the only person at the gig to recognize both '1000 Homo DJ's' and 'Acid Horse'
yeah, i got so wrapped up in playing with wmaker doc apps i plumb forgot ...
yeah, i gotta be there at 9
yeah, i gotta get over starting testing at 5PM really 
yeah, i grew into olives and spicy foods, but never licorice
yeah, i had that too
yeah, i had to go back and subclass a buncha shit
yeah, i have  a feeling that's fixed
yeah, i have a four hour training session with chapman at 11 so needed to make sure all was ready, bad day to have to get up early though
yeah, i have been using opinionlab.onshore.com
yeah, i have no data tho
yeah, i have that too but there's nowhere to park here on campus
yeah, i have the other one
yeah, i have to go pick up the fax from kathy with the education stuff
yeah, i hold my breath when i walk past
yeah, i just booted from the same cd on aniother machine
yeah, i just deleted all their data :)
yeah, i just left it alone, computer magic
yeah, i just look at the tapes...
yeah, i kick to you...
yeah, i knocked out a couple sloppy boogs real quick
yeah, i know
yeah, i know how to find the groups a user is in, just wanted the reverse
yeah, i know how to make a 'manhattan' now
yeah, i know its been written a thousand times
yeah, i know there's someplace i gotta tell it which extensions to parse on
yeah, i know!
yeah, i like the british girls
yeah, i like the old hermitage trestle over by there
yeah, i like the way it is now...
yeah, i looked
yeah, i love those books. Another one by her is the power of your other hand
yeah, i miss napster
yeah, i need a squeezy toy here
yeah, i need to get a sketch doen for yesmial but while they peruse it i'll have time
yeah, i never gave them a chance in high school
yeah, i only did it once
yeah, i pay $500 for software that I cannot use.
yeah, i read in vice that NYC coke is shite these days
yeah, i read up on bash last night
yeah, i recently noticed that
yeah, i remember not particularly enjoying it last time
yeah, i remember when it happend, i just don't remember what the specific prob was
yeah, i saw him play a couple months ago
yeah, i saw that before. pretty neat
yeah, i saw that, the zombie process?
yeah, i saw the mail
yeah, i see them now
yeah, i seen that before too
yeah, i should check out DOM, that's wat mozilla is usgin, corrct?
yeah, i should just use them
yeah, i should really figure that shit out for kathleen
yeah, i think 1.7 will be smoother definitely
yeah, i think albini's reference is something to do with basebal
yeah, i think all i have to do is remove that line of metadata
yeah, i think buzz is pretty amateurish too, but hey it IS win98
yeah, i think fail-wm is the one we want in most cases
yeah, i think four is about as high as i can go
yeah, i think i'm on the way now
yeah, i think it soudns like erosion.  like you've got this really detailed texture and you can wear it down to a smooth surface by filtering it
yeah, i think it was postgresql suckage
yeah, i think resolutions for most of them are fairly self-explanatory as long as the user has seen the policy screen
yeah, i think so
yeah, i think the main change that is screwing up wheaton is this:
yeah, i think we just forgot to display it 
yeah, i think you need to specify --with-htdocs-url or something?
yeah, i think you're right. he was on stage with some really tall guys though, so he didn't look that tall
yeah, i thought abou that
yeah, i took a look - i think i'll leave it alone for the time being
yeah, i tried hooking up a hub between the modem and the airport router but tha tdidn't work
yeah, i tried to filter most of that out
yeah, i wanted to be TawnySuccubus
yeah, i was always amazed by what some of the students there could handle, full time job, 3 or 4 classes and a couple of kids!!  and then others would complain about the smallest requirements
yeah, i was basically tryting to use the Hub as a splitter, which i guess isn't really a plausible concept
yeah, i was e coli dismayed by the ram joke
yeah, i was getting dropouts between skeletor and strings
yeah, i was hoping i could M-x check-my-shit
yeah, i was like ... go ahead but then you'll have to pay us to reinstall webcheckout
yeah, i was on the phone with them for like 3 hours on sat. nite 
yeah, i was talking manual testing
yeah, i was talking with them when they were recovering from the hd failure
yeah, i was thinking about where george lucas went wrong
yeah, i was thinking we could use something like that here
yeah, i was using saic data and that was pretty befouled as well
yeah, i was whooping it up in the theater
yeah, i was wondering how we were going to do that LDAP shite
yeah, i went out on sunday with a hankering for a hot italian but got there an hour too late
yeah, i wonder if it's related to the switch from wcodemo user to webcheckout user?
yeah, i wonder if someone else contracted it before me ie kelly
yeah, i wonder why their oppposed to a single database
yeah, i would actually mark 2998 as a dupe of 3011
yeah, i would wager
yeah, i'd have to put the modem into promiscuous mode, right?
yeah, i'd just as soon not ship it with known blockers
yeah, i'd say that's a 2.1 at best
yeah, i'll bet he was sleeping when he was over them
yeah, i'll close it
yeah, i'll prolly need it when i start helping y'all
yeah, i'll upgrade session.lisp tonight too
yeah, i'm a dork
yeah, i'm citing it
yeah, i'm copying RPM files all over the state
yeah, i'm enjoying looking throug the stuff it trapped -- the reasons are hilarious
yeah, i'm going to start putting in a couple extra hours in from home to try and start updating the docs.  The release notes will really help though, so cheers to lee!!
yeah, i'm here
yeah, i'm just going to rip burt reynolds' bio from the Boogie Nights website
yeah, i'm just kidding
yeah, i'm not sure why that would be a bad idea
yeah, i'm noticing
yeah, i'm rebuilding clean whenever i see massive checkins and noting bugs as i come across them
yeah, i'm sick of being hassled by the fuzz
yeah, i'm spending money at about 1000% of my gross revenue, so by 1999 standards i'm about ready for an IPO
yeah, i'm sure it is. he know his computers well enuf
yeah, i'm sure onshore si will have that internet up and humming asap
yeah, i'm the next jerry seinfeld
yeah, i'm thinking webco-users
yeah, i'm trying to branch out to real instruments
yeah, i'm waiting and waiting for pro-tools for linux d00d
yeah, i've got one of those
yeah, i've restarted apache and webco now with no dice
yeah, i've used :wherein before...
yeah, if a resource has status rsvp, can we have it listed under the resource on ck just like if it was out on one?
yeah, if craig leaves irc he ceases to exist
yeah, if he digs that, that's a positive geek sign
yeah, if they don't get overwritten by the import
yeah, if we are backing up all the data nightly, why do we need every allocation ever made in there?  does SAIC really need to be able to pull up cancelled reservations from 1999?
yeah, if you can't get zenirc working you can always use BitchX, which is the IRC client i use
yeah, if you change users
yeah, if you move your mouse around things start to show up but only on roll over
yeah, if you think so I wam willing to do it, when do you want to go through it with me?  i have two meeting this afternoon so tomorrow would be better for me
yeah, ill see wassup on the cmucl tip
yeah, im there, i see the list of scripts and the +s, but cant tell what they do
yeah, in Thai Bhat though...
yeah, in that config.pl thing i guess
yeah, init-package :cold-boot is failing 
yeah, is that adaquately explained in the docs in huge bold red 24pt text yet?
yeah, is that just a matter of pinifying circulation policies?
yeah, is the fetching little dog a funny joke
yeah, is what i'm hoping for
yeah, it affects gopher as well as skel and strings
yeah, it aint Arthur Bryant's
yeah, it could be cut
yeah, it doesn't
yeah, it happened with both gnome and now icewm
yeah, it happens to be th thing I'e beend oing for two weeks too
yeah, it happens with demo data and saic data
yeah, it has a raid
yeah, it is really nice
yeah, it is somewhat less fussy but still not totally clear
yeah, it is. @:)
yeah, it like being on prozac without the sexual side affects
yeah, it looked like about 2 days though...
yeah, it looks good
yeah, it looks like an autocirculate authorization error on utah...
yeah, it looks like it needs remigration
yeah, it looks like they are
yeah, it must suck to have every bulemic goth girl in North America hot for your fishnet jock
yeah, it ought to
yeah, it probably could.
yeah, it said I'm a grass, who smokes hippy freaks
yeah, it seems a bit... you know
yeah, it seems like kel is putting all of it together into one single bid...also, i'm really going to have to sit and work on this division of phase 1 and phase 2
yeah, it seems so
yeah, it should
yeah, it should be a hard error for now
yeah, it should be delete-stray-oc-nodes
yeah, it should be more explicit about 1.8.7->2.0.3->2.0.5 too
yeah, it shows...
yeah, it sounds kind of handy
yeah, it started up at 14:15
yeah, it totally is
yeah, it was about that 150 hour estimate you gave the other day
yeah, it was an early episode and they got a tv or something because marvin monroe couldn
yeah, it was either a table or a picnic blanket or something
yeah, it was on accident
yeah, it was so cool and then bam! it got really warm and everything is blooming all at once
yeah, it was some really good, pro music... you know, I think it needs to try to break new ground and stuff but I don't know what you're going for...
yeah, it was very similar in fact
yeah, it works pretty nice, got it the first time
yeah, it would be hard to find a CSS-P bug in netscape 2.0
yeah, it's  there so that if the two keyword args that are added to the wrapper don't clash with the named parameters supplied.
yeah, it's BSD at heart
yeah, it's a blank file
yeah, it's all thanks to ameritech
yeah, it's an imaginary method
yeah, it's certainly not blocking anything
yeah, it's computing it to my local timezone i guess
yeah, it's either microcenter or onshore si
yeah, it's engraved
yeah, it's funny as hell
yeah, it's getting there definitely
yeah, it's going to be hard to test ...
yeah, it's got scsi and drives and all that shit already
yeah, it's handy when making new objects but lame when they already exist
yeah, it's hard enough as it is
yeah, it's just a time-domain spectral image
yeah, it's just that they screwed up their checkout center names
yeah, it's kind of a one-trick show righ tnow
yeah, it's kind of p2 at this point
yeah, it's land line that
yeah, it's like protection from creditors or something
yeah, it's like the lowest common denominator of peoples tastes
yeah, it's like the whites only grocer for the new millenium
yeah, it's made of lead
yeah, it's more of an anthropological view on semiconscious motivation of early human civilization
yeah, it's nice
yeah, it's not pressing but i think alberto has a point
yeah, it's not the best--yet. I'm rooting for it
yeah, it's ok now
yeah, it's ok.
yeah, it's on cafe
yeah, it's only happening on 35mm camera so far
yeah, it's possible
yeah, it's pretty amazing
yeah, it's pretty obvious if you go thru the cmd history
yeah, it's pretty simple
yeah, it's really fun music
yeah, it's really slow for me right now
yeah, it's some weird old cd rom from 1992 that somebody wanted me to try and run on my machine, but it doesn't seem to be working
yeah, it's ssh v2 and they disabled sshv1 compat the freaks
yeah, it's still going
yeah, it's there
yeah, it's there: subject: WebCheckout bug 4224 fixed
yeah, it's trying to initialize system roles
yeah, it's uncouth
yeah, it's very similar
yeah, it's warm here too
yeah, its tea time
yeah, iw as just thinking maybe it would be fun to use them all :)
yeah, jay has a tiny girlie voice
yeah, jeff
yeah, jesse rags me every week that we're using oracle at all..
yeah, josh quit
yeah, jsut thought of that
yeah, just '='
yeah, just because nobody else does it doesn't mean you shouldn't :)
yeah, just blip over that...
yeah, just checking if my query was working or not
yeah, just coming out of trials now.
yeah, just curious
yeah, just file a bug or notify ayres
yeah, just for art!
yeah, just keep 'em away from raul
yeah, just like once i'm a famous techno superstar they will be climibing over eachother to get at my loins
yeah, just like that
yeah, just one reason i don't prefer mac cvs
yeah, just revert buffer i guess
yeah, just stopped in on the way back
yeah, just throw a little sleep loop in there
yeah, just wanted a second op
yeah, kiddo wanted to start at 45K
yeah, knew dat
yeah, leave poor time warner alone. they are just trying to make it in this topsy turvey world
yeah, left message
yeah, less bad
yeah, less boring than being unemployed
yeah, let me commit here...
yeah, let me know if you need any help lowering those regression tests
yeah, let's do natural language parsing for our resource import
yeah, let's hope
yeah, like 4-color offset presses...
yeah, like Brits are froma country we're not aloud to trade with 8)
yeah, like I was soooo horked dude!
yeah, like an intellectual Hugh Heffner ... rocking the pipe and house-coat
yeah, like distilled even
yeah, like in the breadcrumbs
yeah, like it seems to some kina bot n' shit though...
yeah, like ol yeller
yeah, like that
yeah, like they cost all of $20
yeah, like this ¡
yeah, like those
yeah, lisp errors scare users
yeah, lisp starts but oos no work
yeah, listen to them backpedal on their pledge to eliminate terrorism now
yeah, little cameras
yeah, little snippets of text indicating which lines changed,
yeah, log on as saic and dump the saic db
yeah, lois what?
yeah, looks like iris-import loses accessory data
yeah, looks like thats it
yeah, lucent has a team of 10,000 assigned to it.
yeah, lyn ... prove your existence
yeah, make it ready to go
yeah, make like a banana and split
yeah, make like a bee and buzz off
yeah, make like a train and get out of here
yeah, make pong playable
yeah, make sure everything is the right color and font; take out her kooky font and span tags
yeah, mark as such. fix coming in in 5 minutes
yeah, maybe we should just institute an opt-out policy instead of opt-in
yeah, maybe we should then
yeah, maybe with different sessions too
yeah, maybe you could just link or something on the old data
yeah, me Sulu n' shit
yeah, me neither
yeah, me too
yeah, more like slut
yeah, most of that stuff isn't currently searchable using the high-level interface...
yeah, mostly
yeah, much FIXME spam
yeah, must upgrade.
yeah, my buddy jon lived in germany for 2 years and at the end people didn't BELIEVE him when he said he was american
yeah, my connector host which gives me a link to onshore went down ...
yeah, my dad would kill me if i overthrew anything
yeah, my mail folder is empty
yeah, my thoughts exactly
yeah, needs a lot more testing in my op
yeah, no java
yeah, no need to advertise
yeah, no panicked wheaton emails!
yeah, noice
yeah, non-blockers
yeah, non-unique meta prop
yeah, not a major dilly
yeah, not sure, aks jesse
yeah, note how much better their service is when your buying dsl from them instead of northpoint
yeah, note on their data there is an Accessories root rtype
yeah, nothing i can do about it ... sorry, just slow code...
yeah, now i wanna see Manhunter which is supposed to be better
yeah, now let's figure out why accessories don't show up
yeah, now that it's been slashdotted
yeah, obsolescent now prolly
yeah, obviously when testing migration, we did not consider enough ways the data could be fucked up
yeah, of course, everything is documented :)
yeah, oh please, let me do it
yeah, ok
yeah, ok, do you want to have a quick client mtg tomorrow?
yeah, ok...
yeah, old
yeah, on Queso
yeah, on gopher
yeah, on phone, one min pls
yeah, once jhu is guaranteed up
yeah, only 1 needed
yeah, only pussies listen to America
yeah, only to 2 printers from what I understand
yeah, option is takes 3 times as long
yeah, or if you want to use one reservation you can always renew to add a resource and then return the one item you want to off of it
yeah, otherwise it would take another month or so
yeah, our technically adept sales guy
yeah, people keep rewriting the applet
yeah, picture raul circa 1999 checking Director projects into cvs
yeah, pigfucker, you got it backwards
yeah, playa! good idea kathleen
yeah, playing frisbee and kicking sand in the faces of weaklings no doubt
yeah, please
yeah, please...
yeah, pops open a window
yeah, porno always gets him
yeah, post it!
yeah, postfix reload
yeah, postgres is up and running here
yeah, prbly
yeah, prllly
yeah, probably
yeah, probably get hepatitis too
yeah, probably if you run into that one you are doing somethign wrong anyways
yeah, probably would just do 50% for each
yeah, probably yer best bet ... you can just read it on gopher, can't you?
yeah, producer maps right in query now too
yeah, prolly
yeah, puddley, and no bad drivers
yeah, put a hit on Elf
yeah, raph messed up .. well, actually GNATS did.  it is evil
yeah, really
yeah, remember the definition of role:
yeah, remember?
yeah, right
yeah, right LAX, JFK, ORD and LGN
yeah, right, it's just retroism without much substance
yeah, rob@onshore
yeah, rsync does...
yeah, saic instance is stale ... depending on when it was last updated you might need to rerun setup.sh too
yeah, saic was completely deactivated afaict
yeah, same here
yeah, same source as last time
yeah, same time as you
yeah, saw some suffering cyclists out there
yeah, saw that. footer stuff too. 
yeah, saw the data
yeah, says invalid with mic0001 aaaa ya dig?
yeah, see if you removed it then you couldn't roll back and that would defeat the porpoise of cvs
yeah, see the pravda quotes aren't in a table
yeah, see those numbers between where it says November and 2001
yeah, send me a mail; right now I gotta go guy RAM and get a cable mode, as well as eat
yeah, she just said we ought to get together before the summer is over
yeah, she knows about that stuff and is quite html literate considering
yeah, she's gotta have it
yeah, she's interested, but sounds like she's too late
yeah, shouldn't be a problem for yesmail, i'm thinking more in terms of lefty
yeah, signal level meter should be suitable
yeah, silly ain't it
yeah, simple arg change
yeah, since they were making better computers and selling 'em cheaper
yeah, skip that
yeah, sliced duck w black sauce
yeah, so I've gone a long ways towards that I think
yeah, so don't dude me, dude!
yeah, so fun!
yeah, so i still have to reboot now and again
yeah, so is the L and the N
yeah, so it makes sense that it's source is not around
yeah, so they can get all sadistic on you and your loved ones
yeah, so, like let me clean up ok boss???
yeah, some level of team fragmentation until we get 3rd floor going
yeah, something's wrong, there's no function called wcof::wco-load-test-data anymore
yeah, sometimes I wonder why I think sitting in a room is better than living my life
yeah, sorry ... my mom made an appointment in the afternoon and her ride fell thru
yeah, sorry.
yeah, sorry.  that's pretty much catch-all
yeah, sorry...
yeah, sorta. 
yeah, speed blows there
yeah, speedy Raid 5 or Raid 3 disks 
yeah, spooky movie there
yeah, sql output shows the proper value
yeah, ssh == openssh, potato seems to have 1.2.2-1.4
yeah, ssh connect to onshore sux from outside
yeah, still trying to break it
yeah, strike that
yeah, suck
yeah, sure
yeah, sure you did
yeah, sure you're at the top
yeah, tell him to just make the footer in html himself
yeah, tell me about it
yeah, that
yeah, that 
yeah, that getting started document
yeah, that has got to stop
yeah, that is how I feel about dag's band, except it's so bad we'll never top it...
yeah, that is how I feel about my band, except it's so bad we'll never top it...
yeah, that is how i busted her
yeah, that is my IP
yeah, that is one fragile piece of ui code there
yeah, that is strange
yeah, that mostly got screwed up around 2.0 and hasn't been fixed 
yeah, that must be it
yeah, that one
yeah, that place i live when i'm not at my desk.
yeah, that remains to be seen ...
yeah, that should help 
yeah, that sounds about right
yeah, that sounds similar
yeah, that tape and Ren and Stimpy were surefire cures for bum trips
yeah, that was a lamo hack cos i just wanted to see it go
yeah, that was an issue before i believe
yeah, that was before i reproduced it... silly
yeah, that was it.
yeah, that was my impression
yeah, that was probably a myopic vision at best - it did bring in some ole greenback though
yeah, that whole bugs under my skin thing really sucks
yeah, that whole fame thing
yeah, that will work
yeah, that won't hurt anything i guess
yeah, that would be help
yeah, that'd be cool
yeah, that's 2
yeah, that's a cool one
yeah, that's a man page bug
yeah, that's about it.  
yeah, that's from all the Oggi people be eating
yeah, that's how we need to think when writing them in general, eh?
yeah, that's it
yeah, that's kind of what i was leaning towards
yeah, that's more helpful
yeah, that's my man CJ comeing thru
yeah, that's my question, which I gotta call them about since I don't know if BA has the technical capability
yeah, that's not it
yeah, that's popular
yeah, that's probably him
yeah, that's probably the right place for it
yeah, that's really helpful to me at this point
yeah, that's right ... you can tell by looking at auth-granting
yeah, that's right, I guess you've already done that @:)
yeah, that's right, I remember
yeah, that's the first code-snippet ever
yeah, that's the only thing remaining
yeah, that's the school's problem if they don't have enough cameras to go around
yeah, that's weird
yeah, that's weird isn't it
yeah, that's what I ended up doing. 
yeah, that's what I said
yeah, that's what I saw
yeah, that's what I was thinking
yeah, that's what I'm realizing
yeah, that's what i am doing now
yeah, that's what i do most of the time
yeah, that's what i figured
yeah, that's what i thought...
yeah, that's what i'm a doing
yeah, that's what jesse said too
yeah, that's what they're made for
yeah, that's what throws the error actually
yeah, that's when we started caching all kinds of metadata etc
yeah, that's why I asked
yeah, that's why they rule :)
yeah, thats a bit better
yeah, thats mine to deal with
yeah, thats what i thought
yeah, thats where i saw it
yeah, the .jar file is there
yeah, the 1.8.3 usql module was not deallocating memory properly
yeah, the 88 one
yeah, the Vector class
yeah, the circulation screen is a strange abomination 
yeah, the consul granted entry cleraance at the last moment!
yeah, the converter i used is fucked
yeah, the day looks like 48 hours long
yeah, the delay is not a java issue
yeah, the error is sender domain must exist
yeah, the fateful day when adam's floppy collection got hosed down by the CFD hook & ladder team
yeah, the file names were definitely a bit of information that really needed to be there
yeah, the hub over by here has plenty of socketz
yeah, the interface between wall-time and location-scheduling
yeah, the internet is all fucked up
yeah, the internet is kewl
yeah, the line was a boy, the dot a girl
yeah, the lisp compiler
yeah, the login screen is sorta...bereft of imho objects
yeah, the old alderman is so bad, that even though i've been re-districted out of her ward, i'm still actively supporting her challenger
yeah, the one that is currently on your alpha url
yeah, the only one that didn't base itself on shitty microsoft outlook code
yeah, the pile of dry tinder wood is about 3 feet out my bedroom window too
yeah, the project domain is really fascinating
yeah, the release notes for 1.8.6 say it was fixed there
yeah, the saic login and password
yeah, the second one you suggested returns a bug-category instance
yeah, the slot machines there must be even louder than the ACCD server fan
yeah, the stockholders are all freaking after fitz's speech last night
yeah, the thing is most schools run around 90 days or soimething
yeah, the thrill of moving over and over again
yeah, then it's very easy
yeah, then they applied that term to all the punk kids
yeah, then they switch the dial on their microminiature dayglo radio that turns into a robot
yeah, there are still the claw marks where he tried to escape
yeah, there is another java issue in 2.0.2
yeah, there is no reservation, so nothing needs to be replaced
yeah, there were fixes for propagating ec changes around within a session...
yeah, there weren't very many people there and there were 4 djs so the payout wasn't too hot
yeah, there's a screwy scrollbar in the applet
yeah, there's an rpm
yeah, there's good stuff in there, and of course there's crap
yeah, there's los simpson here too, but I speak 
yeah, there's nothing like the ability to make your own decisions
yeah, there's plenty of evidence
yeah, there's some wack backends
yeah, there's the rub 
yeah, they all fail on that set-simpleton thingy
yeah, they all pass now so I'm deleting them
yeah, they all said use tulip kernel mod
yeah, they all want to rub my laptop
yeah, they are closely related, except the craig-bot is extended to retrieve hip-hop lyrics from a database
yeah, they are dealing with 512MB RAM there
yeah, they are from around 1-4
yeah, they are functionally identical
yeah, they are not exactly mr nice regime
yeah, they are not fully using webcheckout yet so it was not a priority
yeah, they are the only other school besides saic that routinely gets those stuck alloc thingies
yeah, they could do Film-Sync and Film-Unsync as root types
yeah, they do have the exact same interface now don't they
yeah, they do, we are already working on that
yeah, they had a couple of good parties
yeah, they have pretty much the same niche
yeah, they just didn't have enough work for him
yeah, they just got togethere
yeah, they look the same in menu.hook and they work
yeah, they made it sound like they invented ADSL
yeah, they need installed next week
yeah, they never tell you
yeah, they probably are identical screens actually
yeah, they rocked
yeah, they set that up
yeah, they should both join the Wu Tang Clan
yeah, they should start putting those trouble-making palestinians in forced-labor camps
yeah, they should... I've heard the release manager saying the backlog would get kicked to woody
yeah, they should?
yeah, they weren't interested in my beans and rice
yeah, think so
yeah, thinking about it, in fact it's best to do that ...
yeah, thinkpad a21e
yeah, this is a concept album
yeah, this is bullshit
yeah, this one was more british
yeah, this situation dictates it
yeah, this web site named several buildings with ratings and everything
yeah, those are sux
yeah, those are the best
yeah, those are unneccessary
yeah, those escalate, especially when you are dealing with slimy employers
yeah, those have some good talking points 
yeah, those need to be the most streamlined UI-wise since they are the most-used
yeah, thought so
yeah, timestamps are all like about 1 year old
yeah, tmpfs is a virtual memory based filesystem which shares swap and tempfilesystem...
yeah, to be able to change the disposition of the invoice to waved
yeah, to get postgres user
yeah, too bad we coulda had a regular old brawl
yeah, too bad will ferrell left
yeah, too much ,monitor is bad for you
yeah, true. 
yeah, turn the canada, mississippi, michigan, alabama into links like the others
yeah, turnaround time ignored on mine too
yeah, ucla.webcheckout.net for the work craigb did
yeah, um guys there's some white powder on the kitchen counter near the non-dairy creamer canister, i think it's anthrax
yeah, um there really shouldn't ever be overlapping schedule nodes unless its unserialzied
yeah, undefined functions
yeah, under the FEE column
yeah, unless you just want to use default admin password and encourage users to do it via the app
yeah, until the world figured out the french were all smelly snobby froggies
yeah, use a black background color
yeah, use acid
yeah, use the Common Lisp Enterprise Eggplants interface
yeah, usually they play hardcore punk
yeah, very fun and nice... only a few rude parisians
yeah, very warm and sunny here too
yeah, want to take a couple day trips with the friends
yeah, was that dollars or pesos?
yeah, way too much troubl3
yeah, we are relaying for the entire 209.224 class b
yeah, we are using it for Broadacre.
yeah, we ate at Pennys
yeah, we did that too
yeah, we know
yeah, we might as well start documenting what's broken
yeah, we might refactor which ones can be non-distinct
yeah, we miss you too, but we do have your face on picard's body to keep us warm
yeah, we must torture 
yeah, we should correct on the lisp side
yeah, we should send out an advisory 
yeah, we should start DOSing their phone system again
yeah, we want a home of our own
yeah, we're doing it
yeah, we're pretty far into it
yeah, we're squeezing into bill's car supposedly
yeah, we've been a little preoccupied the last 2 weeks
yeah, weird
yeah, weird eh?
yeah, well
yeah, well adam wrote the shell script that calls it
yeah, well all the others are conceivable
yeah, well anyway if you think it should be in the migration i can do that
yeah, well gary and i were just discussing this...
yeah, well i don't discuss such matters with the customers
yeah, well if it doesn't blow up we're much closer :)
yeah, well look at his new email
yeah, well she was trying to get me to come out with her and her sex freak chums afterwards
yeah, well submit the bug, call raph and rob and perhaps you have a fighting chance
yeah, well that means we need to find an icon for departments
yeah, well that's what happens, you have somebody who innovates a particular style, and then somebody who comes along and popularizes it, and eventually it gets corrupted into pepsi commercials :)
yeah, well the gore daughters ... whoo-ee
yeah, well the thing is they are getting pressure from scott to move to webco so he can EOL the old software
yeah, well they asked for it anyway
yeah, well they can reinstall NT if they have too...
yeah, well they don't have a clue what to do
yeah, well usually we have any number of ready-to-go test sessions 
yeah, well we should definitely double check
yeah, well we're finishing the last of the keyword stuff now
yeah, well were there any changes to how policies are treated or set maybe?
yeah, well, he seems clean, track marks healed up
yeah, well, my situation is different since ange is sending mail from my box as well..
yeah, well, my situation is different... I have a 4 machine network here
yeah, well, that is a little different
yeah, well, the capability to do it...
yeah, what a concept
yeah, what a difference 30 degrees makes
yeah, what he said
yeah, what is spaxe? 
yeah, what's he thinking
yeah, what's that about josh?
yeah, what's up baby?
yeah, whatever dag's using
yeah, when he asked me if I would be his friend i almost freaked out and fled
yeah, when i was working on that one i removed everybody from the group to speed that up
yeah, when you type l
yeah, where
yeah, where the other stuff is...
yeah, which is kinda annoying, but the raphics rock
yeah, which is really pleasing to look at
yeah, who needs managers
yeah, why?
yeah, with soo do chop
yeah, within a wcof-session
yeah, word?
yeah, worked on wednesday  ... i logged two months worth o' hours thru it...
yeah, working feels really good in a lot of ways
yeah, wow
yeah, write, but not delete
yeah, yeah, that guy
yeah, yeah, you could say that
yeah, yeah--okey
yeah, yeah.
yeah, you can find an active checkout by resource id
yeah, you can get a filtering proxy or something
yeah, you can't fool her...she is a web technologist
yeah, you gotta make clean tho
yeah, you have a fix ready for them?
yeah, you just go on thinking that, byte-breath
yeah, you know, cheese, ok right?
yeah, you metaobject bigot
yeah, you might want to clarify that onshore-si doesn't support webcheckout and they shouldn't bother with the auto-direct there and only deal with the receptionist 
yeah, you pick off a few segments and the rest of it increases its velocity proportionally
yeah, you rule
yeah, you want me to come down?
yeah, you want to talk some more about that?
yeah, you would need to snarf a hash table library somewhere and learn its particular interface
yeah, you'll be picking many a bean
yeah, you, Matt and Lefty
yeah, your email program just says AndyStarr wrote
yeah-up
yeah.
yeah. 
yeah.  I heard Damon's new band is not too great. 
yeah.  Nothing to do but to wipe it. 
yeah.  i do that
yeah.  i liked the part where she was sucking her own butt
yeah.  i sorta took a break
yeah.  i'm going to shag that slag and show her me bollocks
yeah.  just a feeling i had though.  didn't want to step on toes
yeah.  large groups allow for happy rounds of deindividualization
yeah.  my building was on E.R. last night and i want to find out if my roommate got it taped
yeah.  restarted from scratch. 
yeah. B-Schoolers with bright ideas make scary things. 
yeah. Did you look at it>
yeah. I add Fat Bastard, it create Alica Adams n' shit
yeah. I don't know how people feel about it tho...
yeah. I got that. I will do so later. Thanks
yeah. I have a pcmcia card and eject it and change configs  to change locations
yeah. I splash around in watercolors every once in a while
yeah. I've had to turn my brain around a bit to deal with Java's obscene static typing.
yeah. It had been dormant for a month, then came to life 1 hours after he submitted his resume
yeah. People will come to our page just to doenload our logo
yeah. burning.
yeah. exactly like george michaels.  except for the part about the public restroom of course.
yeah. god bless america
yeah. ha ha ha
yeah. he set a streaming audio server at his work last week
yeah. i bet.
yeah. i know
yeah. in many cases they are interchangable terms
yeah. it's 500mhz g3 with airport and dvd
yeah. mac folk were unable to get mail this morn but that was fixed. dunno what was wrong tho
yeah. no boot into what i tell you no boot into
yeah. no popcorn for me there
yeah. right.
yeah. stoner metal
yeah. that's nice.
yeah. that's rough
yeah. that's the orso remix
yeah. the iPods are very very cool.
yeah. the penthouse dude indeed
yeah. the release notes reference two old bugs: 2888 2889.
yeah. things seem a bit .. uh.. fast
yeah. too easy
yeah. was most excellent
yeah. well Ill prolly be a bit better for subsequent quarters. Im knocking a lot of rust off my brain hinges
yeah. when you're really civil and hold back most of the time, the build up can be explosive when it does come out
yeah. you tape up your fingers to give extra support
yeah. you too
yeah..
yeah.. 
yeah..  ok... so...
yeah.. got it mostly untangled
yeah.. personally i would feel weird travelling right now
yeah.. so really though does anyone know if there's a linux client for apple talk?
yeah.. the latter sounds better...
yeah.. this thing is totally helping
yeah.. wait, I think I hav ethat...
yeah.. what for
yeah...
yeah... 
yeah...  is this all on wwwdev, or did you mirror it out?
yeah... I don't see any CVS changes... you checked i tin?
yeah... I know lefty was looking at the stuff andy was mentioning
yeah... I shall respond there
yeah... I think guanabana is sitting on my old desk by it... I'll run a serial cable to it and check 'er out
yeah... I was a bit nervous, but they totally set me up.
yeah... I'm just considering the parts we're *not* yet building...
yeah... I'm there..
yeah... catch22
yeah... figgerd a bad pun never hurt a distribution...
yeah... he was saying.
yeah... hee
yeah... hmm
yeah... hmmm
yeah... i assume they already have the Cgi backend for logging all this stuff...
yeah... i never had a problem with him
yeah... ima go through em again... after a little production...ok thanks...
yeah... isn't that sad?
yeah... it is there.. duh
yeah... it makes the indexes...
yeah... it might be other scripts doing that...
yeah... it must be that the object that defines that var is not around
yeah... it wasn't anything to do with the ticker, just some cgi scripts, right?
yeah... it's 17 preloads on every page.  we really should do the javascript in house
yeah... it's not working now... damn
yeah... it's secure in that it will not execute any external code
yeah... me too
yeah... or in CA for training
yeah... peeping
yeah... prolly not a good idea
yeah... right now my problem domain consists of drawing pretty colored rectangles
yeah... see my mail I just sent out...
yeah... sell it in a can, so you can open a can of whoop ass
yeah... that is hand-rolled, not CGI::Cookie
yeah... that was fun to setup
yeah... true...
yeah... vogt is a freelancer... the other two are going on the payroll, btw
yeah... well..
yeah....
yeah.... I have to call around and find out who can fscking split
yeah.... new top banner... sounds like...
yeah........
yeah....i got one row of states done....
yeah....pretty sad...
yeah....until I need to see your healthy faces...
yeah...but is he gonna check his mail..?
yeah...hmmm this could get tricky...
yeah...kristine is the one finalizing the templates and grphic names etc...
yeah...replace... the site in go live could get icky.
yeah...thats right....
yeah..?
yeah..you'll like it...

yes    
yes  of course
yes  there is a bug for that
yes 'Mutilate with Crapplet'
yes - I email craig address ands adam emails me info good
yes - I gathered that in my last sojourn
yes - I noticed that testing was opened today too
yes - buena suerte
yes - i have a new pad and bike
yes - i read of this in email
yes - i was in toronto just prior to thanksgiving - very cool town
yes - is there anything emacs cannot do?
yes - it's definitely draft
yes - it's not bad
yes - lisp is merged
yes - only jake could actually be serious about it as well
yes - pick pocket I am sure
yes - saw him and king crimson here a few years ago
yes - sorry
yes - the land of smiles
yes - we could use a stable tester now
yes - you rock @:)
yes -- I dunno if there's a configure option
yes -- if you start calling them responsible worker... that's wrong
yes -- it's a network install image 
yes -- so I should move that up?
yes -- sorry i stole some of your cheddar
yes -- yes they do
yes -preheat
yes . and it can be readded if needed
yes . he has been letting us use his MPC3000 and this is me and nate's return favor to him
yes .. .war
yes .. I think?
yes .. an instance, at least? Do you mean, our schema?
yes .. ask kreg too
yes .. but you wouldn't hit the framework sessions
yes .. colloid is the one with little bits of crud in like fluid
yes .. freedom and some friends drove to milwaukee to see the Vito Acconci retrospective
yes .. ho kakos arthropodos
yes .. is it the first try for that?
yes .. it makes things faster and easier. If a property changes on an object, the whole thing gets reindexed
yes .. it's allowed
yes .. lots of reasons
yes .. more 'lobodiva'
yes .. muffin and machiatto from expensive coffee house
yes .. sclerotic
yes .. status should report that
yes .. that's bad
yes .. that's different
yes .. the rest is just a literal identifier
yes .. try creating reservations again please
yes .. well, it would be easier to control in this scheme
yes ...
yes ... i had the extra step where it was checking to see if the person changed every time, but your idea simplifies that 
yes 1 + n
yes 1 sec

yes bug
yes bugzilla is now reachable
yes but I betcha it's the same problem.... 
yes but I said deleting and you reiterated dutr
yes but at least its fast
yes but by laughing you encourage them
yes but compile so fast!
yes but did we migrate their data ever?
yes but does it block usage or is it just sub-optimal
yes but don't underestimate the benefit of using someone who really knows it thru and thru
yes but filey sharey no worky
yes but i am useless
yes but i see where you are going
yes but i wouldn't have learned valuable lessons in shell scripting like you're always hounding me to do :)
yes but it takes a helluva lot more planning
yes but it turned out to be a problem in validate-modified-schedules
yes but it won't be the same
yes but maybe unwise due to other considerations ... i'll let adam field that one
yes but mine actually makes sense
yes but most of it I think is done already
yes but pretend i'm dag for a second...
yes but the database has DELETED -- a keyword -- not Y
yes but the point is that i erroneously thought we were still using TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE in the 3.0 psql db
yes but then i'd have to check out 3.0 code
yes but they are used for navigation...i guess there should be an empty black bar on the results page
yes but think of how well informed they are
yes but this is one of those end of the year reports that are so popular this season
yes but when i am playing at being a mook i do not touch the lisp listener
yes but you can't floss the attitude like puffy and then come out and dance like n'sync
yes but you could use it as a weapon
yes but you get to do fun stuff while i'm the little salesbitch
yes but you might as well just take a screenshot of it for all the good it does

yes, bug 4420
yes, but I 9ignored it
yes, but I also need to see that the data coming in is right and loaded right
yes, but I disabled the listener in httpd.conf
yes, but I don't get what the data is coming from?
yes, but I don't know about the bug, havent seen it
yes, but I havent run the dev fixture in a while
yes, but I think you're wrong in your conclusion
yes, but I was having some problems with restore, has to do with the order of classes being registered with the hierarchical indexes
yes, but I'm a little confused where to do that 
yes, but I'm saying it can't be done unless we know the class the reservation is for
yes, but Im not gonna take her.
yes, but also just to explain what the messages are so she's not confused
yes, but as far as the release notes are concerned i don't think we have to go into that much detail
yes, but auto-test ?
yes, but beleive you me, it's stressful.  We are afterall, largely on the person heroics end of the ISO scale
yes, but both were very high
yes, but doesn't seem to take
yes, but don't return formatted html from the framework. it should be a server package function that does that
yes, but don't we change admin pass and pin generally on install?
yes, but even so it seems evil
yes, but groups are simply ways of putting persons together
yes, but he's dead
yes, but he's wrong
yes, but his stuff is going to be needed for 2.0.x though
yes, but how would that apply to a reciept?
yes, but i can't change our entire organization's operating system just at this moment!
yes, but i could school you and scott
yes, but i don't know how 
yes, but i invariable miss one
yes, but i just couldn't type anything in me buffer
yes, but i just found it last week
yes, but i'd rather warn you than have you try that again and have me forget it
yes, but i'm getting really tired of proving it over and over again
yes, but i'm the one who spilled my guts to eric
yes, but i'm waiting for kristine to tell me HOW MUCH to embiggen it
yes, but if they fall on the fish tank, i might be able to save sydney, and our stuff, whereas they don't really have motivation to do that
yes, but isn't there a format on the biblio as well?
yes, but it shouldn't at all
yes, but it shows red for checkouts too
yes, but it tends to blow the stack and burn your house down.
yes, but it's a topical steroid
yes, but it's more like 2 hours instead of 4 or whatever
yes, but it's not introduced thru my own fault
yes, but it's the best long-term plan IMHO
yes, but jeff pearson hasn't been in any of them
yes, but listen
yes, but move on -- it's not a requirement
yes, but new features are incredibly well spec'd by yours truly
yes, but not aftger return
yes, but not if they have subtypes withresources
yes, but not really directed at you
yes, but not roles as mappings for resuath-authorizations
yes, but once VPN is up, do we need it?
yes, but raph the porn star is here too so watch out
yes, but remember what we talked about, listening
yes, but soul asylum doesn't RAWK
yes, but that facet definition is sort of different for a marc-stored record rather than an alist 
yes, but that's a function that can be done by other means
yes, but that's a indirect field only avialable for searching
yes, but that's not a full update
yes, but the cost incurred is less than the price charged, that is how..
yes, but the dmeo would go down
yes, but the duration it compares is clock time rather than only considering time which is covered by checkout center open time, right?
yes, but the function is gone and supposed to be gone?
yes, but the input, the entry..
yes, but the secure_login hack is *only* relevant for the http->https + https->http case
yes, but then I can't contorl the width of the line itself
yes, but there is a greater discriminaton with an AK47 or an M16.
yes, but there were no code violations cited at all
yes, but they're doing it on an abacus untill we install webcheckout
yes, but those aren't in dynamic range
yes, but those deps are either bog standard, or controlled by us 
yes, but we only allow manual *fine* assessment at return time right?
yes, but what application will be reading this file?
yes, but what did you do just before it hung
yes, but where is your mail, precisely, on the file system
yes, but why doesn't it happen regular as it used to ?
yes, but with consensus among the developers
yes, but you said:
yes, but you will be able to pay the rent
yes, but you're treating it as a speci8al case

yes, it is leftover from 1.8.x if that is what you meant
yes, it is multihoming
yes, it is never my fault, i assure you
yes, it is not
yes, it is only from within their internal system

yes, it will compile
yes, it will create an extra applet param tag but that will be of no consequence, it will just be ignored
