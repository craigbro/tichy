Work, work, work.
There are monkey-boys in the facility.
You are secure. Do not panic. John Endall must die.
Lord Whorfin must live. Work, work, work.
Keep your noses to the grindstone.
The greatest joy is the joy of duty. Work, work, work.
The monkey-boys are evil.  Lord Whorfin is supreme.
The great vehicle itself is now in final boarding state.
If you are not inside at this point, you have missed the boat.
We are now go for launch.
Work, work, work.  There are monkey-boys in the facility.
You are secure.  Do not panic.  John Endall must die.
Lord Whorfin must live. Work, work, work.
Keep your noses to the grindstone.  The greatest joy is the joy of duty.  Work, work, work.
