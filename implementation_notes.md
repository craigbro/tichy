From the article on 'phenomenology' in the Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy:

Intentionality essentially involves meaning, so the question arises
how meaning appears in phenomenal character. Importantly, the content
of a conscious experience typically carries a horizon of background
meaning, meaning that is largely implicit rather than explicit in
experience. But then a wide range of content carried by an experience
would not have a consciously felt phenomenal character.
