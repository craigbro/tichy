Front hall.  MRS. JOHNSON is at her desk.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and the LINDLEYS
burst in.

MRS. JOHNSON:

        Buckaroo!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Mrs. Johnson, this is Casper and Scooter Lindley.  Is Hikita-san
        here yet?  Where's the overthruster?  Where's Penny?

MRS. JOHNSON:
        The Prof is in the, ah, lab with the overthruster.  Penny's in
        the right-wing guest room.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Good.

MRS. JOHNSON:
        Everybody's safe and sound.


BUCKAROO BANZAI and the LINDLEYS head for the stairs.  They meet RENO NEVADA,
NEW JERSEY, and RAWHIDE coming down.

RENO NEVADA:
        They're Lectroids, Buckaroo.

NEW JERSEY:
        Planet Ten.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Planet Ten?  How do you guys know that?

RAWHIDE:
        It's all in the yellow record.  Come on.

RENO NEVADA:
        Heyyy, Casper Lindley!

CASPER LINDLEY:
        Reno.


They go upstairs.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Yellow record?

PERFECT TOMMY:
        However, they didn't come here on a non-stop flight.  They blasted
        through the 8th dimension in 1938, over in Grover's Mill.

NEW JERSEY:
        Where there was a huge electrical dimensional accident, some
        giant explosion, and they _hypnotized_ Orson Welles into covering
        it up, so first he says there's an invasion from Mars, but then
        he says no no no, it was just a radio show hoax.  Get it?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        No.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Let's go.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Orson Welles??  What about Yoyodyne?  What about Dr. Lizardo?

NEW JERSEY:
        That's what we're trying to tell you.

RENO NEVADA:
        There's _someone_ living inside him!


They go down the upstairs hall to the bunkhouse.

BILLY TRAVERS:
        Here, y'all put these on.  There's one in the box, one over there...

BILLY TRAVERS distributes lectroid goggles.  They all put them on.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        What's this?

RENO NEVADA:
        It came with the record.  It's like a 3-D type thing.

RENO NEVADA is preparing the BLACK LECTROID message device.

PINKY CARRUTHERS:
        How was _I_ supposed to know he came from outer space?  This
        Rasta guy pedals up to the front gate and delivers it all in a
        pink _cake_ box.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Why?  What's it for?

NEW JERSEY:
        We don't know.  It wouldn't tell us.  It wants to talk to
        the head honcho.

RENO NEVADA:
        Lights!

They turn the lights off.  A column of light appears from the device, and
resolves into the image of JOHN ENDALL, a dreadlocked woman
in a silver uniform.

JOHN ENDALL:
        Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.  I am John Endall, from
        Planet Ten.  A common grave danger confronts both our worlds.
        After a bloody reign of terror...

MRS. JOHNSON enters.  She squints, trying to see what's going on.

MRS. JOHNSON:
        Hey, what _is_ that?

RAWHIDE puts a pair of the goggles on MRS. JOHNSON.

JOHN ENDALL:
        ... the hated leader of our military caste, the self-proclaimed
        Lord John Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher even as your Hitler...

MRS. JOHNSON:
        Oh, wow...

JOHN ENDALL:
        ... was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and condemned,
        along with several hundred of his followers, to spend eternity
        in the formless void of the 8th dimension.  Death was deemed...
        [[ALT DIALOGUE:"... too good for their ilk."

BILLY: Who's Penny?

TOMMY: Well, where is she?]]

RAWHIDE:
        (to MRS. JOHNSON)  Did you tell Penny Buckaroo was looking for her?

MRS. JOHNSON:
        I looked in her room, she wasn't there.

JOHN ENDALL:
        ... too good for them.

BILLY TRAVERS:
        Who's Penny?

RAWHIDE:
        Well, where is she?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Will everybody please _shut up_ so I can hear the rest of this thing?

JOHN ENDALL:
        Now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally _helped_ John
        Whorfin with your oscillation overthruster.  For our intelligence
        warns us he intends to _steal_ your overthruster.  If he should
        attempt this, we will have _no choice_ but to disrupt world-wide
        electronic communications, and fire a particle beam weapon from
        your airspace to Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist
        Republics.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        (alarmed)
        That's an action the Kremlin would most certainly misinterpret
        as an American first strike!  They're already a little trigger-
        happy as it is!

[[ALT DIALOGUE:

JOHN EMDALL: 
        Exactly, Perfect Tommy! The Soviets _will_ retaliate! And your President Widmark 
will launch a mass counterforce strike. And within twenty minutes, the danger to 
Planet Ten will be removed.

ALL Look around

JOHN EMDALL:
        But... because we're good guys... we're giving you a chance to save your planet.]]


JOHN ENDALL:
        Stop... John... Whorfin... before sun... set!  If you fail, we
        will be _forced_ to help you destroy yourselves.

RAWHIDE:
        I'll tell you, if it ain't one thing, it's another.

PINKY CARRUTHERS:
        I know.

JOHN ENDALL:
        (sternly)  End of discussion.

NEW JERSEY:
        Discussion?!  What discussion?
        
The message ends and the image of JOHN ENDALL fades out.

CASPER LINDLEY:
        She gotta be kiddin', right?  Vaporize the whole damn _planet_?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        You wanna roll those dice, Casper?

CASPER LINDLEY:
        No... no-ho-ho, no, no.  Not me, man.  No way.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Gents...  we're going to Yoyodyne.
        Rawhide, see how Hikita-san's coming with that formula.

RAWHIDE:
        Right.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Billy, tell Sam to prep the jet car for city driving.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        What about a Blue Blaze strike team?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Naw, we'll keep it intimate.  Call the Kolodny brothers, call
        the Rugsuckers.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Where're you going?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Get my guns.


BUCKAROO BANZAI's bedroom.  PENNY PRIDDY is hiding in the bathroom.
BUCKAROO BANZAI pokes around, looking for his guns.

[[ALT: penny's line out]]

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Okay, okay, I'm a girl.  I won't deny it.  I sneaked into
        your bedroom, I invaded your privacy, I went through all
        your personal belongings...

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (frustrated)
        Ohhh... MRS. JOHNSON!  I can never find anything around here.

[ALT penny's line out]]

PENNY PRIDDY:
        ... I took a bath!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Penny, what's your problem?

[[ALT DIALOGUE:

PENNY:
        Where did you get that picture of us? 

BUCKAROO looks at a picture of him and Peggy on the table.

PENNY: I mean, that can't really be me, right? Unless it was taken in the 8th dimension. 
Who is she? Who am I? What am I doing here?]]

BUCKAROO BANZAI has found his guns.  He pulls a holster from a cabinet.

[[ALT: penny's line out]]

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Me!  You!  That picture!  I think I'm going crazy...  Who's that
        girl, Buckaroo?  What's going on around here?  You drag me out
        of jail, you're... you're like Jerry Lewis, you give me hope to
        carry on, but... then you leave me in the lurch while you strap
        on your six-guns!  What do you want from me, Buckaroo?  Who am I?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Near as I can figure, you had an identical twin sister...  and I
        married her...
        
PENNY PRIDDY slowly opens the bathroom door and looks at BUCKAROO BANZAI.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        ... but that's all over now, and she's gone, and that's
        about all there is for me to say about that...


A laboratory.  PROF. HIKITA and an ASSISTANT are bending over a large
Erlenmeyer flask full of bubbling green liquid.
PROF. HIKITA paces, deep in thought, while the ASSISTANT watches.

PROF. HIKITA:
        Don't know what to expect here...  all the standard pictures...
        it's producing a magnetic force...  No, no, I'm wrong!

Suddenly JOHN BIGBOOTE appears behind the ASSISTANT.  He throws him to the
floor and spits a dart into him.  The ASSISTANT yelps.
PROF. HIKITA grabs the overthruster and escapes.


Hall outside the lab.  RAWHIDE is patrolling.  He spots JOHN BIGBOOTE
leaving the lab and chases him.

[[SCENE: PENNY and BUCKAROO are in the bedroom.

PENNY: Where is she?

BUCKAROO: She's dead. Murdered. A Present from Hanoi Xan.

PENNY: Hanoi Xan. The Boss of the World Crime League. The guy in the comic books.

BUCKAROO: No (slowly)... not the guy in the comic books...

BUCKAROO spins the chamber on his gun.

BUCKAROO: A guy out _there_... 

BUCKAROO waves his pistol barrel...]]

BUCKAROO BANZAI's bedroom.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and PENNY PRIDDY are gazing
into each other's eyes.  PENNY PRIDDY slowly moves towards him.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Ohhhh, tell me I'm dreaming...

They are about to kiss when PENNY PRIDDY touches BUCKAROO BANZAI's hand.
There is a bright blue spark as PENNY PRIDDY is shocked.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        OWWW!

She shakes her hand, obviously in pain.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Sorry, I'm _sorry_, I got...

PERFECT TOMMY bursts in on them.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Buckaroo!  Sorry...  Sam's dead.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Sam?

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Someone broke into the jet car.  Things are going haywire
        over at the lab.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (to PENNY)  Wait here, I'll be right back.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Uh...


In the lab.  BUCKAROO BANZAI bends down over the body of the ASSISTANT.

RENO NEVADA:
        Holy...

BUCKAROO BANZAI pulls a Lectroid dart off the ASSISTANT's neck.
        
RENO NEVADA:
        He's dead.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Spread out.  They can't be very far off.


They rush into the hall.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Okay, Tommy, check the biomedical labs.  Reno, you take the physics
        wing.  Jersey, go with Reno.

NEW JERSEY:
        Where're you going?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Engineering.


They separate.  As PERFECT TOMMY and NEW JERSEY move off, NEW JERSEY is
pointing his gun at the ceiling.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Cowboy!

NEW JERSEY:
        What?

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Hold the gun in front of you, man.

NEW JERSEY:
        Oh, I see... okay.  It's... okay.


BUCKAROO BANZAI goes down a corridor.  An alarm is sounding.  He passes a
file cabinet with one drawer open and the files inside burning.  
BUCKAROO BANZAI enters a room, discovers RAWHIDE struggling
with JOHN BIGBOOTE.

RAWHIDE:
        Buckaroo, behind you!

BUCKAROO BANZAI shoots at JOHN BIGBOOTE, misses.
JOHN BIGBOOTE spits at RAWHIDE and escapes through a window.
BUCKAROO BANZAI grabs RAWHIDE, eases him to the floor.

RAWHIDE:
        (in pain)  Ooooh....

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        You... you okay?

RAWHIDE:
        (with difficulty)
        Yeah... yeah, just... get my breath... the Professor went down...
        into the purification vent.  He's got the overthruster...

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Great.

BUCKAROO BANZAI exits through the window.


Meanwhile, NEW JERSEY and RENO NEVADA are searching another lab.  They pass
racks of equipment, including a large watermelon clamped into some sort of
apparatus.

NEW JERSEY:
        Why is there a watermelon there?

RENO NEVADA:
        I'll tell you later.


Shots of BUCKAROO BANZAI cautiously searching dimly-lit corridors and
PROF. HIKITA down in the basement, searching for a way out.


Cut to PENNY PRIDDY descending stairs to the basement.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Buckaroo?  Rawhide?  Anybody?...


Shot of JOHN BIGBOOTE in basement, looking for PROF. HIKITA.


PENNY PRIDDY enters a room.  There is a barrier down the center.
PROF. HIKITA is on the other side, trying to unlock a gate in the barrier.
PENNY PRIDDY gasps in surprise when she sees PROF. HIKITA.

PROF. HIKITA:
        Here, young lady.  The overthruster...


JOHN BIGBOOTE is outside the room.  He begins to pound on the door on
PROF. HIKITA's side.  PROF. HIKITA takes the overthruster out of its case
and slides it under the barrier to PENNY PRIDDY.

PROF. HIKITA:
        Put it in your purse.


JOHN BIGBOOTE breaks the door open.  PENNY PRIDDY takes the overthruster
and runs.  PROF. HIKITA is trapped against the barrier.

PROF. HIKITA:
        Nooo!
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE grabs him.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Where's your overthruster, LITTLE MAN?


BUCKAROO BANZAI appears at the end of the hall.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Hikita-san!

BUCKAROO BANZAI shoots at JOHN BIGBOOTE, misses, and drops to the floor.
JOHN BIGBOOTE spits at BUCKAROO BANZAI, likewise misses, turns, and runs.


PENNY PRIDDY rounds a corner at the bottom of the basement stairs and runs
into JOHN O'CONNOR.  He smiles strangely.

JOHN O'CONNOR:
        Nice morning, huh?

PENNY PRIDDY gulps.


BUCKAROO BANZAI and PROF. HIKITA chase JOHN BIGBOOTE, but are blocked by a
metal door.  JOHN BIGBOOTE has torn a small hole in the door and escaped.


Back in the lab where RAWHIDE was hit, PERFECT TOMMY and NEW JERSEY are
trying to help him.

RAWHIDE:
        It's just like my legs are asleep, know what I'm saying?

PERFECT TOMMY:
        What the hell is _wrong_ with him?

NEW JERSEY:
        I dunno.  I dunno.
        (to RAWHIDE)
        Are you _cold_?

BUCKAROO BANZAI and PROF. HIKITA enter.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (to RAWHIDE)
        What're you still doing on the floor, pal?

RAWHIDE:
        Well, I think it's 'cause I can't move my legs.
        
NEW JERSEY examines RAWHIDE, pulls something off his back.

RAWHIDE:
        Ooooh!  Damn.

RAWHIDE:
        What is it, Apache?

NEW JERSEY:
        Radioactivity...

RAWHIDE:
        Ohhh, spiders... so I was right, huh?

PINKY CARRUTHERS enters, escorting JOHN PARKER.

PINKY CARRUTHERS:
        We got the guy, Rawhide.  Saw him in the hall, and...

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (to JOHN PARKER)
        Any antidote for these things?

JOHN PARKER:
        Nooo, not at all.
        
JOHN PARKER squashes the spider-thing on the floor.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        So, that mean you're on our side?

JOHN PARKER:
        That's right.

RAWHIDE:
        Ohhhh... oh, man... those things pack a mean wallop, uh?...
        
RAWHIDE looks around.  He is fading fast.

RAWHIDE:
        What're y'all lookin' at?...  We're on the clock, saddle up, huh?

RAWHIDE's eyes close and he dies.


Sound of a helicopter taking off outside.  They run to the window.

CASPER LINDLEY:
        Hey, man, they're stealin' my helicopter!

RENO NEVADA:
        They got Penny!

PROF. HIKITA:
        She... she has the overthruster!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        We'll get it back!  We'll get it back.


Later, in PRESIDENT WIDMARK's hospital room.  PRESIDENT WIDMARK is
strapped into some kind of rotating frame, surrounded by medical equipment.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        It's... it's not Buckaroo Banzai _per se_, Mr. President.
        It's his _men_.  Foreigners, some of them!  Or their names have
        been changed.  Their _true_ backgrounds are shrouded in secrecy!
        Now, all I'm saying is that this jet car belongs in the hands
        of Defense.  I mean, uh... if the Banzai Institute doesn't want
        to sell it to us, then we're gonna have to _take_ it from them!
        In, uh, the national interest, of course.

Somebody knocks on the door.
        
PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Come in.

SMIRNOFF:
        Excuse me, Mr. President.  World Watch One, direct incoming
        transmission.

SMIRNOFF wheels a videophone into the room, turns it on.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Hello, Mr. President.  I know your back is killing you,
        but, uh, I have a developing situation here and I must speak frankly.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Buckaroo, ahh.... Secretary of Defense McKinley and my National
        Security Advisor Smirnoff are... visiting me, but I have no secrets
        from them.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Well, something has reared its ugly head in outer space, Mr.
        President, and it looks like the Earth is caught in a crossfire.
        We have reason to believe that there are _vicious red aliens_
        walking freely among us.  Posing as the owners and operators of
        Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.  

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Ahh... Yoyodyne Propulsion, ahh...  the people working on
        our Truncheon bomber?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        (shocked)
        In the hands of _foreign nationals_?!?


[[ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE:

BUCKAROO: No, no,  not exactly, Mr Secretary; Red Lectroids from Planet 10 
led by Lord John Whorfin. And what they're building... forget the Truncheon 
bomber; what they're building is an enormous...]]

WIDMARK: slow down buckaroo; we go back a long way together, but...]]


JOHN PARKER appears next to BUCKAROO BANZAI on the screen.

JOHN PARKER:
        Excuse me, Mr. President.  Time is short.  In order to prevent
        John Whorfin's escape, my comrades are at this moment takin' up
        a geostationary position over New Jersey.  De situation is explosive!

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        What the _hell_ is that?

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Explosive?  What are you saying, man?  Some kind of race war
        in New Jersey?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        No, Mr. President, no.  This... this _man_, as you call him,
        is not a human being at all, but is in fact a Black Lectroid,
        named John Parker, from the very same Planet Ten, and his 
        spaceship is at this very moment anchored above Yoyodyne.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Yoyodyne!....

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Buckaroo... my good friend...


[[ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE:

JOHN PARKER: Ihave delivered a message from my own Chief Executive, John Emdall, 
and she has made it very clear that unless John Whorfin is destroyed before sundown, 
she will fire an atomic beam from American airspace, hit Smolensk, and...

WIDMARK: You're quite serious about this, Buckaroo...? I mean, we go way back...]]


Cut to commo center on the bus.  NJ is looking into a microscope.
His voice can be heard on the videophone.

NEW JERSEY:
        That's it!  These red creatures, they somehow give off the
        bacteria, we breath it, it swims up our nose...  to our cerebral
        cortex, where it literally _talks_ to our brain cells, tells
        us to see exactly what _they_ want us to see.

PROF. HIKITA:
        Electric brainwashing.


Back to hospital room.  The PRESIDENT WIDMARK looks mystified.

NEW JERSEY:
        ... Diabolical.  They get us so confused, they...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Buckaroo...  I, uh...  I don't know what to say.  Lectroids?
        Planet Ten?  Nuclear?  Extortion?  A girl named John?

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Buckaroo!  Lectroid Wing Commander.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have to go talk to the hornets' nest.
        
JOHN PARKER waves to the PRESIDENT.  The transmission ends.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Good God.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai, I'd say commit the man.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Get me SAC Headquarters, NORAD, and the Strategic Space Command.
        I want some hard data on that cloud.  John!  Get out in the
        field.  Stick your beak into this one!


Commo center on the bus.  PERFECT TOMMY is staring at a monitor, which is 
displaying a picture of the BLACK LECTROID command ship.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        What's this thing _made_ of?

RENO NEVADA:
        Cobalt, and electricity!  They're armed for _bear_, Buckaroo.

A telephone rings.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        World Watch One...  Buckaroo!  It's Whorfin.

BUCKAROO BANZAI turns the speakerphone on so everyone can hear.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Dr. Banzai...


Cut to Yoyodyne.  DR. LIZARDO is on the phone.  Various RED LECTROIDS are
working behind him.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Ehh... yes, this is, eh...  Emilio Lizardo.  Maybe you don't-a
        remember me.  ...  Ah.  I'm flattered.  Ehhh... we know the
        same people!


Shot of PENNY PRIDDY, tied to a chair and gagged.  
JOHN O'CONNOR is pouring honey on her from a squeeze bottle.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Yeah, in fact, one of them is with me right now.  Your, ehh...
        associate, Doctor Penny Priddy.

Cut to BUCKAROO BANZAI. 
He looks surprised, and covers the mouthpiece of the phone.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Doctor?!?


Back to Yoyoydyne.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Ehhh... may I pass along my congratulations for your great-a
        interdimensional breakthrough.  I'm sure, in the MISERABLE
        ANNALS OF THE EARTH, you will be DULY INSCRIBED!
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE is examining the contents of PENNY PRIDDY's purse.
He hasn't found the overthruster.

DR. LIZARDO:
        However, ah, Miss Priddy claims to be unable to solve _my_ problem.
        And provide me...


Shot of JOHN O'CONNOR smiling diabolically at PENNY PRIDDY as he shows her
a container of red ants.

DR. LIZARDO:
        ... with the crucial missing circuit for MY overthruster!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (to others)  He hasn't found it.  He hasn't found it.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Maybe _you_ can convince her to TRY.  John O'Connor!


JOHN O'CONNOR removes PENNY PRIDDY's gag.  DR. LIZARDO holds phone up
to her.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        (defiantly)
        I'm not worth it, Buckaroo!  Forget about me!  They'll never
        break me!  Never!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Penny, get _off_ the phone.  Dr. Lizardo, really, what does
        she know about your overthruster?  She's not a scientist...

DR. LIZARDO:
        Then... shall we say... a _penny_ for your thoughts?  Hah hah hah!

PENNY PRIDDY spits at DR. LIZARDO.  He takes the phone and sits back down.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Maybe _you_ can come in her place, huh?  Yoyodyne, Banzai.
        You know the address.  Come alone.  And bring your overthruster!
        
DR. LIZARDO slams the phone down.

DR. LIZARDO:
        He'll come.  I know his-a type.  TAKE HER TO THE PIT!  Go, Bigbooty!

PENNY PRIDDY struggles as JOHN BIGBOOTE and JOHN O'CONNOR untie her and haul
her away.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        NOOO!

DR. LIZARDO:
        Use more honey!  Find out what she knows!


[[SCENE:

PENNY turns

PENNY: Not on your life! You think you' re gonna destroy me like you did my sister!
 I know who you are, _Hanoi Xan_!

PENNY is led away.

JOHN WHORFIN: (pondering) Hanoi Xan? Who's that?]]


In the commo center on the bus.  Everybody is wearing yellow plastic vests
with hoses and mouthpieces attached to them.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        These breathing devices Hikita-san has cooked up will enable you
        to see these beings as they really are, as I've been seeing them
        since yesterday.  As Lectroids.  And to _our_ eyes, they're not 
        very pretty.  Nothing personal, John Parker.

NEW JERSEY looks at JOHN PARKER.  He sees a man with dreadlocks.  NEW JERSEY
breathes from the mouthpiece.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        If we blow this today, there ain't no tomorrow.

NEW JERSEY looks at JOHN PARKER again.  He sees a Black Lectroid.

JOHN PARKER:
        We have only two hundred and forty minutes remaining.

NEW JERSEY looks very disturbed.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Right.  I'm working under the assumption that Penny still has the
        overthruster, but this psycho Whorfin doesn't _know_ that.  So
        that'll be my job, to get her and it back in one piece.  Your
        objective is to eighty-six Whorfin.  You know your two strike 
        groups.  Apache Group, that's you, Reno; Chapparal Group, that's
        you, Perfect Tommy.  John Parker, you ride with Chapparal.  It's
        my guess that no human being has _ever_ been inside the place,
        so who knows what we're gonna find there.  Top priority is the
        overthruster.  Without it, Whorfin can't get off this planet.
        This homing device will probably make it easy to find.
        It may be a lot harder to get back.


PRESIDENT WIDMARK's hospital room.  SMIRNOFF is on the phone.

SMIRNOFF:
        Strategic Space Command now reports all satellite communication
        jammed.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Jammed?!  By who?  Who by?

SMIRNOFF:
        Ah, possible atmospheric conditions, sir.  Solar.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM:
        Solar?

SMIRNOFF:
        Intelligence confirms that Soviets are having the same problem.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Ahhh... Should we be on _Code Red_?

GENERAL CATBURD:
        We go to Code Red, the Russians go to Code Red.  No sense going
        off half-cocked, Mr. President.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM:
        I don't know, but Buckaroo Banzai has never been wrong before.

GENERAL CATBURD:
        The man's been through _solid matter_, for crying out loud!  Who
        knows what's happened to his brain?  Maybe it's scrambled his
        molecules!  All I'm saying, Mr. President, is let's not _panic_!

Weird electronic noises as the room lights flicker and turn red.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        What's happening?

SMIRNOFF:
        Uh... electromagnetic pulse, sir.  Russians just gone to Defense
        Condition Two, sir.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        No choice, then.

GENERAL CATBURD:
        Mr. President, I am a soldier.  And I'm a damn good one.  I've
        got enough decorations to snap a Christmas tree!  All I'm trying
        to say is, and I hope I speak for everyone in this room, is that 
        I am scared.  I'm barely holding my... fudge, right now.

Cut to SENATOR CUNNINGHAM.  She is disgusted.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM:
        Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl, General, and pull 
        yourself together.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        I'm glad _someone_ has the _balls_ to face facts!


[[ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE:

WIDMARK: (mumbling) Forget we're the good guys and we never attack first... 
they think we're godless monsters just like them... put yourself in their samovars...
sitting in the dark without radar... no way they're going to listen to _reason_...

CATBIRD goes out of the room to an MP box outside. A DRESS MARINE snaps to attention.

CATBIRD: What are you waiting for, Lieutenant?

DRESS MARINE: NOTHING, SIR!

CATBIRD: Get that thing in here.

DRESS MARINE: SIR, YES, SIR!]]


Staging area.
BUCKAROO BANZAI is preparing to leave for Yoyodyne in the jet car.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Don't embarrass us.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Have I ever?...  Gimme thirty minutes, then come in and mop up.
        
He starts the jet car.  It sounds like it needs a new muffler.


Hallway at Yoyodyne.  JOHN O'CONNOR is dragging PENNY PRIDDY to the Pit.
She breaks away and runs.  Another RED LECTROID appears in front of her
and they grab her.  She struggles.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        No... oh no!

JOHN O'CONNOR:
        I've had ENOUGH of you, Penny Priddy!

They wrestle her to the floor, which is ankle-deep in greenish water.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Nooo!


PRESIDENT WIDMARK's hospital room.  MRS. JOHNSON has just finished playing 
JOHN ENDALL's message.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Well... Mrs. Johnson, thank you.  It's certainly... food for thought.

SMIRNOFF:
        No answer at the Kremlin, sir.  Just dead silence.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Then, I guess... the moment is upon us.

GENERAL CATBURD:
        Here ya go, Mr. President.  The Presidential emergency action
        documents.  For your eyes only.  John Hancock these, and Hail Mary.

GENERAL CATBURD hands documents to the PRESIDENT.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM:
        You know... on second thought, maybe we should think this through
        a bit more, so that future generations of Americans will...

The lights dim and flicker again.  More weird electronic noises.

MRS. JOHNSON:
        Oh, wow.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        (reading document)  Declaration of War - the Short Form.


Road outside the Yoyodyne plant.  The jet car pulls up to the gate.

GUARD:
        Okay, bring that thing right through the gate.  Straight
        ahead.  Straight ahead.


Interior of the plant.  DR. LIZARDO is on a high platform, haranguing
the RED LECTROIDS.  He is wearing his greatcoat and medals, and trying to
imitate Benito Mussolini.

DR. LIZARDO:
        BLACKS!  Are on this planet!  HERE!  In-a New Jersey!  Coming
        to destroy us!  We must act!  ESCAPE, or die!  We must-a work
        _faster_, to-a finish the Great Vehicle Itself, so that we can-a
        enter the 8th dimension, and FREE our trapped comrades, so
        we can return home, and seize power once again!
        WHAT IS THE GREATEST JOY?

RED LECTROIDS on the floor of the plant are sitting around, eating junk
food and watching TV.  They don't seem too excited.

RED LECTROIDS:
        The joy of duty.

DR. LIZARDO:
        LOUDER!

RED LECTROIDS:
        THE JOY OF DUTY!

DR. LIZARDO:
        History... is-a made at night!  Character... is what you are in
        the dark!  We must WORK, while the clock, she's-a ticking!

RED LECTROID:
        Death to the Black Lectroids!

DR. LIZARDO:
        WHERE ARE WE GOING?

The RED LECTROIDS are a little more animated now.

RED LECTROIDS:
        Planet Ten!

DR. LIZARDO:
        WHEN?

RED LECTROIDS:
        Real Soon!


Directed by the GUARD, BUCKAROO BANZAI drives the jet car into the building.

GUARD:
        C'mon, bring it over here.  This way.  _This_ way!  Now park it.


BUCKAROO BANZAI climbs out as RED LECTROIDS surround the car.
DR. LIZARDO watches from a catwalk as JOHN GOMEZ searches the jet car.

JOHN GOMEZ:
        There's no overthruster!  Get him in here.  
        Get him out of there!  I wanna see his face!  IT'S NOT HERE!

JOHN BIGBOOTE punches BUCKAROO BANZAI in the stomach.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Take him... to the Shock Tower!


Shot of PENNY PRIDDY in the Pit.  Sound of water dripping.  She is tied to
some kind of frame.  A tarantula is crawling up her leg.


Meanwhile, BUCKAROO BANZAI has been put in the Shock Tower.  A device is
lowered onto his head.

DR. LIZARDO:
        The equations... solve them!  Enter your data on this-a keypad.
        And they better be right.  The Shock Tower... is a lie detector.
        Any falsehood triggers a brutal charge to your... auditory meatus.

COMPUTER VOICE:
        Open circuit.

DR. LIZARDO:
        So??!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        You're not getting _jack_ from me until you let Penny out of
        this junkyard.

DR. LIZARDO:
        CURSE-A YOU, BANZAI!  Don't you-a realize what you are _saying_?
        Your whole planet's gonna be destroyed, and you sit here wasting
        time!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Time?  I've got nothing _but_ time.

DR. LIZARDO throws a switch and BUCKAROO BANZAI is shocked.

DR. LIZARDO:
        (gloating)
        Sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife...  Doomed is-a your _soul_,
        and damned is your _life_!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Buh... buzz off.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Bigbooty, more... _power_ to him.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        (annoyed)  Bigboo-TAY.

DR. LIZARDO:
        I want-a my missing circuit!  NOW!

JOHN BIGBOOTE turns the power up.
BUCKAROO BANZAI is shocked again, and screams.


Staging area.  PERFECT TOMMY is sitting under a large umbrella outside the
tour bus.  A helicopter lands and drops off the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE as
the Rugsuckers' van arrives.
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE strides up to PERFECT TOMMY.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Is there something I can help you with, John?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Is Buckaroo upstairs?

JOHN PARKER exits the bus, waves to the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

JOHN PARKER:
        'Ello, Mr. Secret'ry.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Where is he?
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE climbs aboard the bus.


Back to the Shock Tower.  BUCKAROO BANZAI has not been cooperative.

COMPUTER VOICE:
        That won't work either.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Cursed computer!


He stands up and snaps his fingers.  A RED LECTROID moves to turn several
TV monitors on.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Eyy, Banzai.  Take a look at-a your girl friend.

DR. LIZARDO grins, then notices one monitor is blank.  He curses in Italian
and switches it on.  PENNY PRIDDY is visible in the Pit.

DR. LIZARDO:
        She'll-a live, but... only for a while.  And she won't-a enjoy it!
        Only _you_ can save her from a fate even worse than that-a of your
        friend, Mr. Rawhide!

[[SCENE: On the bus:

CATBURD: Anybody got anything? Or are we still blacked out?

NJ: We sit here for 12 more minutes; Buckaroo's orders.

CATBURD: Damn Buckaroo!

CATBIRD grabs a gun from PERFECT TOMMY and leaves the bus]]

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        The missing circuit's in your _head_, Whorfin.


[[MISSING DIALOGUE: According to Peter Weller, 
Rick Richter most regretted this dialogue cut:

JOHN WHORFIN: Whorfin? How did you know that was my secret identity?!?

BUCKAROO: John Emdall spilled the beans.

JOHN WHORFIN is shocked in turn.]]


DR. LIZARDO:
        Bigbooty... activate your probes!

JOHN BIGBOOTE throws switch.  BUCKAROO BANZAI is shocked again. 
He grits his teeth.


The tour bus passes a billboard showing a Boy Scout holding a tiny American
flag and saluting the Yoyodyne logo.  At the top is the legend "The Future
Begins Tomorrow."  At the bottom, it says "A Growing Excited Company."
The bus pulls up to the main gate.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Slow this sucker down.  I'll handle these birds.

JOHN YAYA:
        Whoa!


The bus stops. 
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE jumps off and goes up to the guard shack.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        You young gentlemen have a telephone in here, ah, you wanna jump on
        the horn and get me Mr. John Big Boot?

JOHN YAYA:
        Bigboo-TAY.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Oh, hell, wanna do _anything_ nowadays, you gotta do it yourself!

The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE storms into the shack.  JOHN YAYA follows and grabs
the phone before the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE can pick it up.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        What is your name?

The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE pulls a notebook out of his pocket.  Outside, the
tour bus drives through the gate.  The security guards don't notice.

JOHN YAYA:
        John Yaya.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        John Yaya, huh?  And you are...
        (reads his badge)  John Small Berries!


The tour bus pulls to a stop inside the Yoyodyne complex.  The door is flung
open and various Hong Kong Cavaliers jump out, brandishing assorted assault
weapons.  They cautiously head for the main building.  PERFECT TOMMY is in
the lead.

[[many minor cuts were made in the Yoyodyne interior chase and infiltrate scenes;
actually, to the better; it's tighter in the finished form. Some dialogues or scenes
seemed to help support the story; I have included that material.]]


JOHN PARKER:
        (pointing)  It's down dere.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        What?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        I feel it.  (He runs ahead.)
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        Oh.  We're not...
        
        
They advance past what looks like part of a sewage treatment plant and
enter the main building.  Television sets are placed randomly amid
piles of junk.

JOHN PARKER:
        It's a nest.
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        Birds nest.  People don't nest.
        
JOHN PARKER:
        (shakes his head)  Red Lectroid...
        
They hear something that sounds like a music box.  Moving forward to
investigate, they find a toy carousel.  It is turning and playing a little
tune.  PERFECT TOMMY thinks it's cute.


BILLY TRAVERS:
        Don't touch it.  It might be a bomb, man.
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        Naw...  It's a toy.
        
With a shriek, a RED LECTROID drops onto PERFECT TOMMY's back from overhead.
There is a brief struggle, ending when one of the other Hong Kong Cavaliers
breaks its neck.


Cut to an office in the Yoyodyne building.  A GUARD is sitting behind the
desk as the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE strides in.

GUARD:
        Sir?
        
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Sit down!
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE heads down the hall.

GUARD:
        Hey, that area's restricted!
        
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Yeah?  Not to me!
        

Interior of the main building.  Shots of the Hong Kong Cavaliers covering each
other as they advance.  Many RED LECTROIDS are sitting around, oblivious.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        What _is_ this place?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        It's a bivouac.  They sleep here.
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        [unintelligible]

JOHN PARKER:
        You better believe it.
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        Lizardo.  Which way?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        (pointing)  Over dere.
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        You sure?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Believe it!
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        Just hold on a second.


PERFECT TOMMY runs across an open space.  In the foreground, several
RED LECTROIDS are watching TV and eating potato chips.  JOHN PARKER follows.


PERFECT TOMMY and the rest of Chapparal Group take cover behind a large piece
of machinery on the factory floor.  Apache Group rejoins them.

RENO NEVADA:
        What's going _on_, man?  Where _are_ we?
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        It's a bivouac, man.  They sleep here.
        
Suddenly, the alarm on PERFECT TOMMY's watch goes off.  As he tries to shut it
off, a RED LECTROID hears the beeping, runs to a control panel, and sets off
an alarm.  A klaxon sounds, and the Hong Kong Cavaliers turn and fire
at the LECTROID.  He is hit, and the control panel explodes in a shower
of sparks.


The Shock Tower room.  The klaxon can be heard, and the lights flicker as
the power fails.

DR. LIZARDO:
        (panicked)  What's happening?


Shot of BUCKAROO BANZAI in the Shock Tower.  The probes retract.  DR. LIZARDO
and JOHN BIGBOOTE have forgotten BUCKAROO BANZAI as they respond to the
emergency.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Bigbooty!  Go down to the Pit.  KILL THE GIRL!
        
        
Factory floor.  The RED LECTROIDS are aware of the intruders now, but the
Hong Kong Cavaliers are mowing them down as they attack.  Gunfire, RED
LECTROIDS being hit and falling from rafters, etc.

CASPER LINDLEY:
        Scooter!  Where are you?
        
        
Cut to RED LECTROIDS swarming around their ship, elsewhere in the factory.
JOHN BIGBOOTE enters, takes charge.


Shock Tower.  DR. LIZARDO fiddles with controls.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Eyy!  Somebody shut off that gosh-damned klaxon!
        
He picks up his overthruster and leaves, ignoring BUCKAROO BANZAI who is now
freeing himself from the restraints of the Shock Tower.

PA VOICE:
        Work, work, work.  There are monkey-boys in the facility.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI looks for a way out of the Shock Tower room.

PA VOICE:
        You are secure.  Do not panic.  John Endall must die.
        Lord Whorfin must live.
        
        
Hallway.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE knocks on a door.  A sign reads
"NOBUDY CUMZ IN HERE - SEKRIT".  He opens the door.

PA VOICE:
        Work, work, work.
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE enters a weirdly-lit room containing a maze of
plastic sheeting hanging from the ceiling.


Another hallway.  NEW JERSEY staggers down the hall, panting.  Suddenly someone
touches his shoulder.  There is a bright flash.

NEW JERSEY:
        Uhhhh!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Sorry... I'm sorry, Sidney.
        
NEW JERSEY:
        Buckaroo!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        It's good to see you, pal.  You got a pistol?
        
NEW JERSEY:
        Yeah.  (hands revolver to BUCKAROO BANZAI)
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (pops cylinder, checks to see if pistol is loaded)
        What are you gonna use?
        
NEW JERSEY draws another gun, spins it flashily.

NEW JERSEY:
        Where _are_ we?
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        I'd hate to tell you.
        
NEW JERSEY:
        Uh, where're we going?
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI produces a hand-held direction finder.  An illuminated arrow 
flashes, and there is a clicking sound a lot like a car's turn signal.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        This way.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI and NEW JERSEY move off.


Meanwhile, the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE emerges into the area of the plant where 
the spaceship is being completed.  Power tools can be heard in the background.

PA VOICE:
        Keep your noses to the grindstone.  The greatest joy is the joy
        of duty.  Work, work, work.
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE stares in disbelief at the giant spaceship.

PA VOICE:
        The monkey-boys are evil.  Lord Whorfin is supreme.
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE spots JOHN BIGBOOTE supervising the workers.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Big Boot?  Big Boot!  C'mon a minute, I wanna talk to you!

JOHN BIGBOOTE looks up, surprised.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Hey, what the hell's the matter with you?  You deaf?  I said, 
        I wanna talk to you!


[[SCENE: CATBURD, following JOHN BIGBOOTÉ, gets entangled in the moving, 
rubbery bands of some strange engine]]
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE turns and leaves through a door marked "PITT".


Dark hallway.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and NEW JERSEY advance to an intersection with
another corridor.  RED LECTROIDS attack in turn from each of the four
directions and are alternately gunned down by BUCKAROO BANZAI and NEW JERSEY.
They look at each other, and NEW JERSEY blows the smoke from the muzzle of
his gun.


The Pit.  JOHN BIGBOOTE and JOHN O'CONNOR are preparing to kill PENNY PRIDDY
as the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE enters.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        (steps in ankle-deep water)  Jeez!
        What the HELL is going on here, Big Boot?  Where's my bomber?
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Bigboo-TAY.
        John O'Connor, put the Smon on the track.
        
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Hey, I don't give a flying handshake WHAT your name is, I'm
        here to see a bomber.
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE stares at PENNY PRIDDY.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        _This_ sure ain't it.
        
JOHN O'CONNOR smiles strangely as he puts a slimy alien slug-like thing on a 
track that slopes down towards PENNY PRIDDY's head.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Let's just go back upstairs to my office.  Talk about this like
        two reasonable beings.
        
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        (gestures at PENNY PRIDDY)
        Now you listen to me.  Your private life, that's your own concern, but
        I'm here to see a _bomber_, and I'm damn sure gonna see it _now_!
        
        (points to the water on the floor)
        Look... LOOK at this place!  Don't you have any PRIDE?  It looks like
        a goddamn _pigsty_!
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE grabs the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE's necktie and hoists
him off his feet.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        It's not my goddamn PLANET, understand, MONKEY-BOY?
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE drops the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, who falls to the floor.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Let's get out of here, John O'Connor.
        
JOHN O'CONNOR:
        (disappointed)
        But John Whorfin _said_ we could kill her.
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        DAMN JOHN WHORFIN AND THE HORSE HE RODE IN ON!
        
They leave as the alien creature begins to ooze down the track towards
PENNY PRIDDY.


Hallway.  A RED LECTROID screams and lunges towards BUCKAROO BANZAI.
A shot rings out and the LECTROID falls.  PERFECT TOMMY appears.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        You owe me one, bud.
        

        
The Pit.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE comes to.  He spots PENNY PRIDDY's purse
and crawls painfully towards it.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        (gritting his teeth)
        It's not over yet...  I may be down, but I'm not out.
        

[[ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE: 

    CATBURD: I'm not down yet! I'll come out of this smelling like a goddamned rose!

He fondles the Overthruster.]]

He reaches the purse.  The overthruster beeps from inside.
Suddenly BUCKAROO BANZAI and NEW JERSEY burst in, and star at the 
Smon making its way down the track towards PENNY's face.


NEW JERSEY:
        What is THAT?
        Don't pick it up!  Don't....

There is a high-pitched squeal as BUCKAROO BANZAI sweeps the alien thing off
the track.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE pockets the overthruster and crawls away
unnoticed as BUCKAROO BANZAI and NEW JERSEY bend over PENNY PRIDDY, 
who is unconscious.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Penny...
        (He grabs her wrist, feeling for a pulse.)
        How's she doing?
        
NEW JERSEY:
        Uhh...  I don't know?
        
PERFECT TOMMY searches PENNY PRIDDY's purse.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        There's no overthruster.
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Buckaroo Banzai!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        What?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Dere is little time!  You better come quickly, if your planet is
        still important to you!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI is torn between PENNY PRIDDY and the call of duty.

NEW JERSEY:
        Leave her to me.  You take care of business.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI hesitates.

NEW JERSEY:
        Go.  Go.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Right.
        
JOHN PARKER leaves, followed by BUCKAROO BANZAI.


Control room.  JOHN BIGBOOTE enters.  JOHN O'CONNOR is helping DR. LIZARDO
with his coat.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Where's Buckaroo Banzai?
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        He has-a flown the coop.  Is the girl dead?
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Yes!
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Then sound the call to board the ship!
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        (exasperated)
        Without the crucial missing circuit, we'll never _make_ it!
        
JOHN O'CONNOR:
        They are only monkey-boys... we can still crush them here on
        Earth, Lord Whorfin!
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Noooo...  it's-a time to go home!
        John Bigbooty - you carry my overthruster.  John O'Connor, _you_
        stick-a by my side!
        
DR. LIZARDO and JOHN O'CONNOR hurry off.  JOHN BIGBOOTE is shocked that he is
apparently no longer second in command.


Factory floor.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER are sneaking towards the ship.

PA VOICE:
        The great vehicle itself is now in final boarding state.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI sees the ship for the first time.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        What is _that_?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Is a troop ship.  Lord Whorfin....


Cut to the basket of a cherry picker lifting DR. LIZARDO, JOHN O'CONNOR,
and JOHN BIGBOOTE to the ship.  DR. LIZARDO spots BUCKAROO BANZAI below.

DR. LIZARDO:
        MASSACRE THEM WITHOUT A QUARTER!
        
RED LECTROIDS attack BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER, and are defeated in
bitter hand-to-hand combat.


Interior of ship.  A hatch in the floor opens and DR. LIZARDO is helped inside.

INTERCOM VOICE:
        His extreme eminence, Lord Whorfin, is now aboard.
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Tell the flight attendants to close the doors, and prepare for
        cross check!
        

Factory floor.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER run towards the ship, gunning 
down RED LECTROIDS as they go.  They reach some scaffolding, and climb towards
the ship.

PA VOICE:
        If you are not inside at this point, you have missed the boat.
        

Interior of thermopod.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER climb through
the hatch.

PA VOICE:
        We are now go for launch.
        
They cautiously explore the thermopod.  Suddenly the hatch closes, trapping
them inside.


Ship's control room.  Frenzied preparations are being made for departure.

DR. LIZARDO:
        John O'Connor!  Install my overthruster!
        
INTERCOM VOICE:
        ... all carry-on baggage overhead and secure.
        
A RED LECTROID switches the ship to internal power, and lights go on.


Thermopod.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER can now see the interior.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        What is this?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        It looks like one of our thermopods.
        (ominously)
        But it's a _very_ bad design.
        
They experiment with various controls.  DR. LIZARDO's voice is heard on
the intercom system.

DR. LIZARDO:
        ... your tray tables, secure!  And your seat backs in the full
        upright position!


Ship's control room.

JOHN O'CONNOR:
        Your overthruster is in place, Lord Whorfin!
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        (gesturing wildly)
        It won't work!  IT WON'T WORK!
        
DR. LIZARDO turns to shout at JOHN BIGBOOTE.

DR. LIZARDO:
        SHUT UP, John Bigbooty, you COWARD!  You're da weakest individual
        I ever knew!
        
DR. LIZARDO turns back to the controls as, behind him, JOHN BIGBOOTE 
gives him the finger.


Meanwhile, the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE is snooping around the jet car, which is
covered in plastic.

SCOOTER LINDLEY:
        Get away from that car, or I drink your BLOOD!
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE looks around, and sees SCOOTER LINDLEY aiming an
M-14 rifle at him.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        (nervously)
        Whatcha got there, son?  That's...  uh... not _real_, is it?
        
SCOOTER LINDLEY fires a round at the ceiling.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
jumps back.

SCOOTER LINDLEY:
        Get 'em up.


Ship's control room.  Preparation for launch continues.  DR. LIZARDO is 
removing his shoes so he can work a set of levers with his feet.

VOICE:
        H2 tank pressurization, okay.  We are go for launch.
        
VOICE:
        John Many Jars, establish overthruster beam grid, over!
        Activate oscillator!
        

Factory floor.  BILLY TRAVERS stares at the ship as three bright blue beams of
light appear and wave around wildly, trying to line up with a grid painted
on the wall.


Control room.

DR. LIZARDO:
        John O'Connor!  MY OVERTHRUSTER!
        
He moves levers with his feet.


Exterior.  The ship lurches, and begins to move along its track.  A few
RED LECTROIDS are still outside.

RED LECTROID:
        Don't leave!  DON'T LEAVE!
        

Quick cuts between control room, thermopod, and exterior as the ship
jolts down the track.

RED LECTROID:
        NOOOOOO!  WAIT!


Thermopod cockpit.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        If they can't connect the dots, they'll never penetrate.
        

The ship lurches to a stop.
BUCKAROO BANZAI stares as a milky fluid pours through a channel in the
thermopod's cockpit.

VOICE:
        ... fluid valves now closed.  The problem is corrected.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Wh... what _is_ that?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Is okay.  No worry.  Is an insulatin' liquid.
        

Control room.  DR. LIZARDO is speaking into a microphone.

DR. LIZARDO:
        FULL SPEED AHEAD!  And may I remind you, to fasten your-a seat belts,
        and esstinguish all smoking materials.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        We haven't a CHANCE!  Your overthruster is SHIT!  We'll lose...
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        One more WORD out of you, BigBOOTY...
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Bigboo-TAY!  Tay!  TAY!!!
        
DR. LIZARDO pulls a gun, turns, and shoots JOHN BIGBOOTE.


Cut to thermopod cockpit.

DR. LIZARDO:
        (on intercom)
        Welcome aboard, Banzai.  You're NEXT!
        

Control room.

VOICE:
        Roger, John Mudhead.
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Let's-a go home.
        
VOICE:
        Horizontal velocity is expanding, over.
        

Exterior of ship as massive cables begin to drag it down the track again.

VOICE:
        The wall is softening.


Thermopod.  A cover is removed, and BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER can now
see out the thermopod's windshield.  The wall and its grid markings are 
coming towards them.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Oh, no.
        
        
Quick shots of beams dancing on the grid, DR. LIZARDO's feet frantically
moving controls, the ship accelerating down the track, and the thermopod
cockpit.  BUCKAROO BANZAI ducks just before impact.


Exterior of Yoyodyne's main building.  A section of the wall crumbles
and debris flies as the ship smashes through the wall.  In the control
room, DR. LIZARDO is still manipulating his levers.

VOICE:
        Danger, danger.  We do not have crossover.
        
VOICE:
        Negative mass is critical.
        

View of industrial park as the ship accelerates into a climbing turn.


In the BLACK LECTROID command ship, the WING COMMANDER is eavesdropping on
the RED LECTROID's intercom.

RED VOICE 1:
        We are not in the 8th dimension.  We are over New Jersey.
        
RED VOICE 2:
        All is not lost.
        
RED VOICE 1:
        But we are...
        
WING COMMANDER:
        Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.
        

Thermopod cockpit.  DR. LIZARDO's voice is heard on the intercom.

DR. LIZARDO:
        So sorry, gentlemen.  But I must-a drop the excess baggage.


The thermopod is jettisoned and drops like a rock.

DR. LIZARDO:
        ARRIVIDERCI, BANZAI!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Where's the power?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        I am a diplomat!  I failed flight school!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI grabs a cable hanging from the wall.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        What do we do?  Jump-start it?
        
Seconds before impact, he plugs the cable into a panel.  Whining noises as
the power comes on, and the thermopod stops falling and hovers.  He 
experiments with various controls.


Cut to exterior.  The thermopod climbs, dives, and turns erratically as
BUCKAROO BANZAI tries to figure out how to fly it.


Back to the cockpit.  JOHN PARKER looks very relieved.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        ... stabilizers...
        
JOHN PARKER:
        What's dis?  (indicating a handgrip and trigger next to him)
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Looks like a gun.
        
He pulls the trigger.  There is a whooshing sound, and a pulsing beam of red
light shoots from the front of the thermopod.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        John Parker, take this wheel.
        
They switch places.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Just... just hold on... that's good.  It flies like a truck.
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Good.  What is a truck?


Cut to DR. LIZARDO at the controls of the ship.

VOICE:
        Electric beam is fine, Lord Whorfin.
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Heh heh heh.
        
        
Back to thermopod.  BUCKAROO BANZAI is studying the weapons panel.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Gotta be something to aim...  aim...  aim...
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Whoa!
        
The ship pops out of a cloud directly in front of them, on a collision course.
JOHN PARKER spins the wheel wildly, and they evade the ship just in time.  The
thermopod turns to follow it.


Control room.

VOICE:
        Thermopod on our tail, over.
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        (hisses)
        Banzai!  So, you wanna play GAMES, eh?...
        

Thermopod.  Voices from the ship can be heard on a speaker.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Where's the stabilizer?
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        ... you wanna play HIDE and SEEK, hanh?
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        All right.
        
SHIP VOICE:
        Commence evasive action, over.


The ship begins to jink back and forth, trying to shake the thermopod.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Okay.  Okay.  Start left.  Go left.  More, more, more, more...
        left, left...  LEFT!  I said LEFT!
        
JOHN PARKER:
        This _is_ left!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        I mean _my_ left!  On...  go _your_ right!
        

Control room.  DR. LIZARDO kicks levers frantically as the ship tries to evade.

VOICE:
        Faster.  He is gaining.
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Feets!  Do your stuff!
        

Back to thermopod.  BUCKAROO BANZAI is sighting in on the ship.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Locking, locking now, locking...
        
SHIP VOICE:
        DIVE!  DIVE!  DIVE!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        ...now, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive...
        
They dive to follow the ship.

SHIP VOICE:
        Repeat, Lord Whorfin!  Repeat!  DIVE!  DIVE!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Whorfin...  Sayonara.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI pulls the trigger.


Cut to closeup of DR. LIZARDO at controls.

DR. LIZARDO:
        BANZAI!!  I'LL SEE YOU IN-A HELL!!!


Back to thermopod.  The ship explodes in a massive fireball.

JOHN PARKER:
        We got him!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Go LEFT!  Stop!
        
He grabs controls, stops the thermopod before it flies into the expanding
fireball.


Below, members of Team Banzai look up as the explosion lights up the sky.


Black command ship.

BLACK LECTROID:
        John Whorfin...  _destroyed_.
        
WING COMMANDER:
        Deactivate particle beam.  Tracking zero... zero... zero.
        

BUCKAROO BANZAI is descending on a parachute.  He salutes as JOHN PARKER
hovers the thermopod next to him, then flies away.  BUCKAROO BANZAI waves.


Outside Yoyodyne.  PERFECT TOMMY and RENO NEVADA run up as BUCKAROO BANZAI
lands next to the building.

RENO NEVADA:
        Hah hah!
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        That was one time I thought you'd bought it.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Yeah, me too.  Where's Penny?
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        At the bus.  New Jersey helped me bring her back.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        How is she?  Okay?
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        He said he'd pull her through.  Quite a guy, you want my opinion.
        

Cut to SECRETARY OF DEFENSE and SCOOTER LINDLEY sitting on a bench.
SCOOTER LINDLEY is holding the overthruster and covering the
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE with his M-14.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        You give me that gizmo, I'll give you a _brand new_ crisp
        twenty-dollar bill.  Hunh?
        
SCOOTER LINDLEY grins and shakes his head.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE takes his
hat off and offers it and the money.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        All right, I'll tell you what...


BUCKAROO BANZAI, PERFECT TOMMY, and RENO NEVADA walk up.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Hey, Scooter!  Fall in.
        
SCOOTER LINDLEY whips the $20 out of the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE's hand and
pockets it as he stands up.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE sneaks away.

SCOOTER LINDLEY:
        This what you're lookin' for, Buckaroo?
        
He gives BUCKAROO BANZAI the overthruster.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Scooter...
        (looks at PERFECT TOMMY)
        You got _his_ job.
        
SCOOTER LINDLEY:
        All right!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        You wanna ride with me in the jet car?
        
SCOOTER LINDLEY:
        Wow!  You know it!...  But I have to ask my dad first.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Okay, you ask your dad.  I'll wash up.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI grins at PERFECT TOMMY and walks away.
PERFECT TOMMY looks upset.  RENO NEVADA punches his shoulder.

RENO NEVADA:
        Awwwww....
        

BUCKAROO BANZAI walks up to the bus.  NEW JERSEY is standing at the door. 
He shakes his head.

NEW JERSEY:
        I did all I could.

BUCKAROO BANZAI boards the bus and passes through the commo center.

RADAR BLAZE 1:
        Buckaroo, the President's on line 1, calling about is everything okay
        with the alien space bomb and Planet Ten, or should we just go ahead
        and destroy Russia?
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (distracted)
        Tell him yes on one and no on two.
        
RADAR BLAZE 2:
        Which was yes?  The destroy Russia, or the, uh, number two?


BUCKAROO BANZAI ignores him and goes to a bedroom.  PENNY PRIDDY is lying on a
futon, completely covered by a white sheet.  He whips the sheet away, to reveal
her lying on her back, with her arms crossed.

BUCKAROO BANZAI slowly bends down to kiss PENNY PRIDDY.  As he is about to
touch her lips, there is a bright blue flash and a spark jumps between them.
BUCKAROO BANZAI is thrown backwards.

NOVA POLICE officer grins.

BUCKAROO BANZAI sits up, rubbing his face.  He looks at PENNY PRIDDY, then
stares in disbelief as her leg moves slightly.  

He bends down to kiss her again.  Small sparks as their lips touch.  He
pulls away as she slowly opens her eyes.


BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Careful.   You're all right.

Cut to command ship.  The BLACK LECTROIDS are eavesdropping as usual.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        You look awful, Buckaroo.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        You don't exactly light up a party yourself...

Back to the bedroom.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        ... Penny Priddy.
        
They embrace, and PENNY PRIDDY pulls him down onto the futon as he closes
the blinds.

WING COMMANDER:
        So what.  Big deal.
        
Fade to black.

Front hall.  MRS. JOHNSON is at her desk.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and the LINDLEYS
burst in.

MRS. JOHNSON:

        Buckaroo!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Mrs. Johnson, this is Casper and Scooter Lindley.  Is Hikita-san
        here yet?  Where's the overthruster?  Where's Penny?

MRS. JOHNSON:
        The Prof is in the, ah, lab with the overthruster.  Penny's in
        the right-wing guest room.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Good.

MRS. JOHNSON:
        Everybody's safe and sound.


BUCKAROO BANZAI and the LINDLEYS head for the stairs.  They meet RENO NEVADA,
NEW JERSEY, and RAWHIDE coming down.

RENO NEVADA:
        They're Lectroids, Buckaroo.

NEW JERSEY:
        Planet Ten.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Planet Ten?  How do you guys know that?

RAWHIDE:
        It's all in the yellow record.  Come on.

RENO NEVADA:
        Heyyy, Casper Lindley!

CASPER LINDLEY:
        Reno.


They go upstairs.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Yellow record?

PERFECT TOMMY:
        However, they didn't come here on a non-stop flight.  They blasted
        through the 8th dimension in 1938, over in Grover's Mill.

NEW JERSEY:
        Where there was a huge electrical dimensional accident, some
        giant explosion, and they _hypnotized_ Orson Welles into covering
        it up, so first he says there's an invasion from Mars, but then
        he says no no no, it was just a radio show hoax.  Get it?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        No.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Let's go.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Orson Welles??  What about Yoyodyne?  What about Dr. Lizardo?

NEW JERSEY:
        That's what we're trying to tell you.

RENO NEVADA:
        There's _someone_ living inside him!


They go down the upstairs hall to the bunkhouse.

BILLY TRAVERS:
        Here, y'all put these on.  There's one in the box, one over there...

BILLY TRAVERS distributes lectroid goggles.  They all put them on.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        What's this?

RENO NEVADA:
        It came with the record.  It's like a 3-D type thing.

RENO NEVADA is preparing the BLACK LECTROID message device.

PINKY CARRUTHERS:
        How was _I_ supposed to know he came from outer space?  This
        Rasta guy pedals up to the front gate and delivers it all in a
        pink _cake_ box.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Why?  What's it for?

NEW JERSEY:
        We don't know.  It wouldn't tell us.  It wants to talk to
        the head honcho.

RENO NEVADA:
        Lights!

They turn the lights off.  A column of light appears from the device, and
resolves into the image of JOHN ENDALL, a dreadlocked woman
in a silver uniform.

JOHN ENDALL:
        Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.  I am John Endall, from
        Planet Ten.  A common grave danger confronts both our worlds.
        After a bloody reign of terror...

MRS. JOHNSON enters.  She squints, trying to see what's going on.

MRS. JOHNSON:
        Hey, what _is_ that?

RAWHIDE puts a pair of the goggles on MRS. JOHNSON.

JOHN ENDALL:
        ... the hated leader of our military caste, the self-proclaimed
        Lord John Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher even as your Hitler...

MRS. JOHNSON:
        Oh, wow...

JOHN ENDALL:
        ... was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and condemned,
        along with several hundred of his followers, to spend eternity
        in the formless void of the 8th dimension.  Death was deemed...
        [[ALT DIALOGUE:"... too good for their ilk."

BILLY: Who's Penny?

TOMMY: Well, where is she?]]

RAWHIDE:
        (to MRS. JOHNSON)  Did you tell Penny Buckaroo was looking for her?

MRS. JOHNSON:
        I looked in her room, she wasn't there.

JOHN ENDALL:
        ... too good for them.

BILLY TRAVERS:
        Who's Penny?

RAWHIDE:
        Well, where is she?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Will everybody please _shut up_ so I can hear the rest of this thing?

JOHN ENDALL:
        Now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally _helped_ John
        Whorfin with your oscillation overthruster.  For our intelligence
        warns us he intends to _steal_ your overthruster.  If he should
        attempt this, we will have _no choice_ but to disrupt world-wide
        electronic communications, and fire a particle beam weapon from
        your airspace to Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist
        Republics.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        (alarmed)
        That's an action the Kremlin would most certainly misinterpret
        as an American first strike!  They're already a little trigger-
        happy as it is!

[[ALT DIALOGUE:

JOHN EMDALL: 
        Exactly, Perfect Tommy! The Soviets _will_ retaliate! And your President Widmark 
will launch a mass counterforce strike. And within twenty minutes, the danger to 
Planet Ten will be removed.

ALL Look around

JOHN EMDALL:
        But... because we're good guys... we're giving you a chance to save your planet.]]


JOHN ENDALL:
        Stop... John... Whorfin... before sun... set!  If you fail, we
        will be _forced_ to help you destroy yourselves.

RAWHIDE:
        I'll tell you, if it ain't one thing, it's another.

PINKY CARRUTHERS:
        I know.

JOHN ENDALL:
        (sternly)  End of discussion.

NEW JERSEY:
        Discussion?!  What discussion?
        
The message ends and the image of JOHN ENDALL fades out.

CASPER LINDLEY:
        She gotta be kiddin', right?  Vaporize the whole damn _planet_?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        You wanna roll those dice, Casper?

CASPER LINDLEY:
        No... no-ho-ho, no, no.  Not me, man.  No way.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Gents...  we're going to Yoyodyne.
        Rawhide, see how Hikita-san's coming with that formula.

RAWHIDE:
        Right.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Billy, tell Sam to prep the jet car for city driving.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        What about a Blue Blaze strike team?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Naw, we'll keep it intimate.  Call the Kolodny brothers, call
        the Rugsuckers.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Where're you going?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Get my guns.


BUCKAROO BANZAI's bedroom.  PENNY PRIDDY is hiding in the bathroom.
BUCKAROO BANZAI pokes around, looking for his guns.

[[ALT: penny's line out]]

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Okay, okay, I'm a girl.  I won't deny it.  I sneaked into
        your bedroom, I invaded your privacy, I went through all
        your personal belongings...

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (frustrated)
        Ohhh... MRS. JOHNSON!  I can never find anything around here.

[ALT penny's line out]]

PENNY PRIDDY:
        ... I took a bath!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Penny, what's your problem?

[[ALT DIALOGUE:

PENNY:
        Where did you get that picture of us? 

BUCKAROO looks at a picture of him and Peggy on the table.

PENNY: I mean, that can't really be me, right? Unless it was taken in the 8th dimension. 
Who is she? Who am I? What am I doing here?]]

BUCKAROO BANZAI has found his guns.  He pulls a holster from a cabinet.

[[ALT: penny's line out]]

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Me!  You!  That picture!  I think I'm going crazy...  Who's that
        girl, Buckaroo?  What's going on around here?  You drag me out
        of jail, you're... you're like Jerry Lewis, you give me hope to
        carry on, but... then you leave me in the lurch while you strap
        on your six-guns!  What do you want from me, Buckaroo?  Who am I?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Near as I can figure, you had an identical twin sister...  and I
        married her...
        
PENNY PRIDDY slowly opens the bathroom door and looks at BUCKAROO BANZAI.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        ... but that's all over now, and she's gone, and that's
        about all there is for me to say about that...


A laboratory.  PROF. HIKITA and an ASSISTANT are bending over a large
Erlenmeyer flask full of bubbling green liquid.
PROF. HIKITA paces, deep in thought, while the ASSISTANT watches.

PROF. HIKITA:
        Don't know what to expect here...  all the standard pictures...
        it's producing a magnetic force...  No, no, I'm wrong!

Suddenly JOHN BIGBOOTE appears behind the ASSISTANT.  He throws him to the
floor and spits a dart into him.  The ASSISTANT yelps.
PROF. HIKITA grabs the overthruster and escapes.


Hall outside the lab.  RAWHIDE is patrolling.  He spots JOHN BIGBOOTE
leaving the lab and chases him.

[[SCENE: PENNY and BUCKAROO are in the bedroom.

PENNY: Where is she?

BUCKAROO: She's dead. Murdered. A Present from Hanoi Xan.

PENNY: Hanoi Xan. The Boss of the World Crime League. The guy in the comic books.

BUCKAROO: No (slowly)... not the guy in the comic books...

BUCKAROO spins the chamber on his gun.

BUCKAROO: A guy out _there_... 

BUCKAROO waves his pistol barrel...]]

BUCKAROO BANZAI's bedroom.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and PENNY PRIDDY are gazing
into each other's eyes.  PENNY PRIDDY slowly moves towards him.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Ohhhh, tell me I'm dreaming...

They are about to kiss when PENNY PRIDDY touches BUCKAROO BANZAI's hand.
There is a bright blue spark as PENNY PRIDDY is shocked.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        OWWW!

She shakes her hand, obviously in pain.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Sorry, I'm _sorry_, I got...

PERFECT TOMMY bursts in on them.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Buckaroo!  Sorry...  Sam's dead.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Sam?

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Someone broke into the jet car.  Things are going haywire
        over at the lab.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (to PENNY)  Wait here, I'll be right back.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Uh...


In the lab.  BUCKAROO BANZAI bends down over the body of the ASSISTANT.

RENO NEVADA:
        Holy...

BUCKAROO BANZAI pulls a Lectroid dart off the ASSISTANT's neck.
        
RENO NEVADA:
        He's dead.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Spread out.  They can't be very far off.


They rush into the hall.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Okay, Tommy, check the biomedical labs.  Reno, you take the physics
        wing.  Jersey, go with Reno.

NEW JERSEY:
        Where're you going?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Engineering.


They separate.  As PERFECT TOMMY and NEW JERSEY move off, NEW JERSEY is
pointing his gun at the ceiling.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Cowboy!

NEW JERSEY:
        What?

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Hold the gun in front of you, man.

NEW JERSEY:
        Oh, I see... okay.  It's... okay.


BUCKAROO BANZAI goes down a corridor.  An alarm is sounding.  He passes a
file cabinet with one drawer open and the files inside burning.  
BUCKAROO BANZAI enters a room, discovers RAWHIDE struggling
with JOHN BIGBOOTE.

RAWHIDE:
        Buckaroo, behind you!

BUCKAROO BANZAI shoots at JOHN BIGBOOTE, misses.
JOHN BIGBOOTE spits at RAWHIDE and escapes through a window.
BUCKAROO BANZAI grabs RAWHIDE, eases him to the floor.

RAWHIDE:
        (in pain)  Ooooh....

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        You... you okay?

RAWHIDE:
        (with difficulty)
        Yeah... yeah, just... get my breath... the Professor went down...
        into the purification vent.  He's got the overthruster...

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Great.

BUCKAROO BANZAI exits through the window.


Meanwhile, NEW JERSEY and RENO NEVADA are searching another lab.  They pass
racks of equipment, including a large watermelon clamped into some sort of
apparatus.

NEW JERSEY:
        Why is there a watermelon there?

RENO NEVADA:
        I'll tell you later.


Shots of BUCKAROO BANZAI cautiously searching dimly-lit corridors and
PROF. HIKITA down in the basement, searching for a way out.


Cut to PENNY PRIDDY descending stairs to the basement.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Buckaroo?  Rawhide?  Anybody?...


Shot of JOHN BIGBOOTE in basement, looking for PROF. HIKITA.


PENNY PRIDDY enters a room.  There is a barrier down the center.
PROF. HIKITA is on the other side, trying to unlock a gate in the barrier.
PENNY PRIDDY gasps in surprise when she sees PROF. HIKITA.

PROF. HIKITA:
        Here, young lady.  The overthruster...


JOHN BIGBOOTE is outside the room.  He begins to pound on the door on
PROF. HIKITA's side.  PROF. HIKITA takes the overthruster out of its case
and slides it under the barrier to PENNY PRIDDY.

PROF. HIKITA:
        Put it in your purse.


JOHN BIGBOOTE breaks the door open.  PENNY PRIDDY takes the overthruster
and runs.  PROF. HIKITA is trapped against the barrier.

PROF. HIKITA:
        Nooo!
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE grabs him.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Where's your overthruster, LITTLE MAN?


BUCKAROO BANZAI appears at the end of the hall.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Hikita-san!

BUCKAROO BANZAI shoots at JOHN BIGBOOTE, misses, and drops to the floor.
JOHN BIGBOOTE spits at BUCKAROO BANZAI, likewise misses, turns, and runs.


PENNY PRIDDY rounds a corner at the bottom of the basement stairs and runs
into JOHN O'CONNOR.  He smiles strangely.

JOHN O'CONNOR:
        Nice morning, huh?

PENNY PRIDDY gulps.


BUCKAROO BANZAI and PROF. HIKITA chase JOHN BIGBOOTE, but are blocked by a
metal door.  JOHN BIGBOOTE has torn a small hole in the door and escaped.


Back in the lab where RAWHIDE was hit, PERFECT TOMMY and NEW JERSEY are
trying to help him.

RAWHIDE:
        It's just like my legs are asleep, know what I'm saying?

PERFECT TOMMY:
        What the hell is _wrong_ with him?

NEW JERSEY:
        I dunno.  I dunno.
        (to RAWHIDE)
        Are you _cold_?

BUCKAROO BANZAI and PROF. HIKITA enter.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (to RAWHIDE)
        What're you still doing on the floor, pal?

RAWHIDE:
        Well, I think it's 'cause I can't move my legs.
        
NEW JERSEY examines RAWHIDE, pulls something off his back.

RAWHIDE:
        Ooooh!  Damn.

RAWHIDE:
        What is it, Apache?

NEW JERSEY:
        Radioactivity...

RAWHIDE:
        Ohhh, spiders... so I was right, huh?

PINKY CARRUTHERS enters, escorting JOHN PARKER.

PINKY CARRUTHERS:
        We got the guy, Rawhide.  Saw him in the hall, and...

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (to JOHN PARKER)
        Any antidote for these things?

JOHN PARKER:
        Nooo, not at all.
        
JOHN PARKER squashes the spider-thing on the floor.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        So, that mean you're on our side?

JOHN PARKER:
        That's right.

RAWHIDE:
        Ohhhh... oh, man... those things pack a mean wallop, uh?...
        
RAWHIDE looks around.  He is fading fast.

RAWHIDE:
        What're y'all lookin' at?...  We're on the clock, saddle up, huh?

RAWHIDE's eyes close and he dies.


Sound of a helicopter taking off outside.  They run to the window.

CASPER LINDLEY:
        Hey, man, they're stealin' my helicopter!

RENO NEVADA:
        They got Penny!

PROF. HIKITA:
        She... she has the overthruster!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        We'll get it back!  We'll get it back.


Later, in PRESIDENT WIDMARK's hospital room.  PRESIDENT WIDMARK is
strapped into some kind of rotating frame, surrounded by medical equipment.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        It's... it's not Buckaroo Banzai _per se_, Mr. President.
        It's his _men_.  Foreigners, some of them!  Or their names have
        been changed.  Their _true_ backgrounds are shrouded in secrecy!
        Now, all I'm saying is that this jet car belongs in the hands
        of Defense.  I mean, uh... if the Banzai Institute doesn't want
        to sell it to us, then we're gonna have to _take_ it from them!
        In, uh, the national interest, of course.

Somebody knocks on the door.
        
PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Come in.

SMIRNOFF:
        Excuse me, Mr. President.  World Watch One, direct incoming
        transmission.

SMIRNOFF wheels a videophone into the room, turns it on.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Hello, Mr. President.  I know your back is killing you,
        but, uh, I have a developing situation here and I must speak frankly.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Buckaroo, ahh.... Secretary of Defense McKinley and my National
        Security Advisor Smirnoff are... visiting me, but I have no secrets
        from them.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Well, something has reared its ugly head in outer space, Mr.
        President, and it looks like the Earth is caught in a crossfire.
        We have reason to believe that there are _vicious red aliens_
        walking freely among us.  Posing as the owners and operators of
        Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.  

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Ahh... Yoyodyne Propulsion, ahh...  the people working on
        our Truncheon bomber?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        (shocked)
        In the hands of _foreign nationals_?!?


[[ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE:

BUCKAROO: No, no,  not exactly, Mr Secretary; Red Lectroids from Planet 10 
led by Lord John Whorfin. And what they're building... forget the Truncheon 
bomber; what they're building is an enormous...]]

WIDMARK: slow down buckaroo; we go back a long way together, but...]]


JOHN PARKER appears next to BUCKAROO BANZAI on the screen.

JOHN PARKER:
        Excuse me, Mr. President.  Time is short.  In order to prevent
        John Whorfin's escape, my comrades are at this moment takin' up
        a geostationary position over New Jersey.  De situation is explosive!

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        What the _hell_ is that?

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Explosive?  What are you saying, man?  Some kind of race war
        in New Jersey?

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        No, Mr. President, no.  This... this _man_, as you call him,
        is not a human being at all, but is in fact a Black Lectroid,
        named John Parker, from the very same Planet Ten, and his 
        spaceship is at this very moment anchored above Yoyodyne.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Yoyodyne!....

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Buckaroo... my good friend...


[[ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE:

JOHN PARKER: Ihave delivered a message from my own Chief Executive, John Emdall, 
and she has made it very clear that unless John Whorfin is destroyed before sundown, 
she will fire an atomic beam from American airspace, hit Smolensk, and...

WIDMARK: You're quite serious about this, Buckaroo...? I mean, we go way back...]]


Cut to commo center on the bus.  NJ is looking into a microscope.
His voice can be heard on the videophone.

NEW JERSEY:
        That's it!  These red creatures, they somehow give off the
        bacteria, we breath it, it swims up our nose...  to our cerebral
        cortex, where it literally _talks_ to our brain cells, tells
        us to see exactly what _they_ want us to see.

PROF. HIKITA:
        Electric brainwashing.


Back to hospital room.  The PRESIDENT WIDMARK looks mystified.

NEW JERSEY:
        ... Diabolical.  They get us so confused, they...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Buckaroo...  I, uh...  I don't know what to say.  Lectroids?
        Planet Ten?  Nuclear?  Extortion?  A girl named John?

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Buckaroo!  Lectroid Wing Commander.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have to go talk to the hornets' nest.
        
JOHN PARKER waves to the PRESIDENT.  The transmission ends.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Good God.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai, I'd say commit the man.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Get me SAC Headquarters, NORAD, and the Strategic Space Command.
        I want some hard data on that cloud.  John!  Get out in the
        field.  Stick your beak into this one!


Commo center on the bus.  PERFECT TOMMY is staring at a monitor, which is 
displaying a picture of the BLACK LECTROID command ship.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        What's this thing _made_ of?

RENO NEVADA:
        Cobalt, and electricity!  They're armed for _bear_, Buckaroo.

A telephone rings.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        World Watch One...  Buckaroo!  It's Whorfin.

BUCKAROO BANZAI turns the speakerphone on so everyone can hear.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Dr. Banzai...


Cut to Yoyodyne.  DR. LIZARDO is on the phone.  Various RED LECTROIDS are
working behind him.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Ehh... yes, this is, eh...  Emilio Lizardo.  Maybe you don't-a
        remember me.  ...  Ah.  I'm flattered.  Ehhh... we know the
        same people!


Shot of PENNY PRIDDY, tied to a chair and gagged.  
JOHN O'CONNOR is pouring honey on her from a squeeze bottle.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Yeah, in fact, one of them is with me right now.  Your, ehh...
        associate, Doctor Penny Priddy.

Cut to BUCKAROO BANZAI. 
He looks surprised, and covers the mouthpiece of the phone.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Doctor?!?


Back to Yoyoydyne.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Ehhh... may I pass along my congratulations for your great-a
        interdimensional breakthrough.  I'm sure, in the MISERABLE
        ANNALS OF THE EARTH, you will be DULY INSCRIBED!
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE is examining the contents of PENNY PRIDDY's purse.
He hasn't found the overthruster.

DR. LIZARDO:
        However, ah, Miss Priddy claims to be unable to solve _my_ problem.
        And provide me...


Shot of JOHN O'CONNOR smiling diabolically at PENNY PRIDDY as he shows her
a container of red ants.

DR. LIZARDO:
        ... with the crucial missing circuit for MY overthruster!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (to others)  He hasn't found it.  He hasn't found it.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Maybe _you_ can convince her to TRY.  John O'Connor!


JOHN O'CONNOR removes PENNY PRIDDY's gag.  DR. LIZARDO holds phone up
to her.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        (defiantly)
        I'm not worth it, Buckaroo!  Forget about me!  They'll never
        break me!  Never!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Penny, get _off_ the phone.  Dr. Lizardo, really, what does
        she know about your overthruster?  She's not a scientist...

DR. LIZARDO:
        Then... shall we say... a _penny_ for your thoughts?  Hah hah hah!

PENNY PRIDDY spits at DR. LIZARDO.  He takes the phone and sits back down.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Maybe _you_ can come in her place, huh?  Yoyodyne, Banzai.
        You know the address.  Come alone.  And bring your overthruster!
        
DR. LIZARDO slams the phone down.

DR. LIZARDO:
        He'll come.  I know his-a type.  TAKE HER TO THE PIT!  Go, Bigbooty!

PENNY PRIDDY struggles as JOHN BIGBOOTE and JOHN O'CONNOR untie her and haul
her away.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        NOOO!

DR. LIZARDO:
        Use more honey!  Find out what she knows!


[[SCENE:

PENNY turns

PENNY: Not on your life! You think you' re gonna destroy me like you did my sister!
 I know who you are, _Hanoi Xan_!

PENNY is led away.

JOHN WHORFIN: (pondering) Hanoi Xan? Who's that?]]


In the commo center on the bus.  Everybody is wearing yellow plastic vests
with hoses and mouthpieces attached to them.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        These breathing devices Hikita-san has cooked up will enable you
        to see these beings as they really are, as I've been seeing them
        since yesterday.  As Lectroids.  And to _our_ eyes, they're not 
        very pretty.  Nothing personal, John Parker.

NEW JERSEY looks at JOHN PARKER.  He sees a man with dreadlocks.  NEW JERSEY
breathes from the mouthpiece.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        If we blow this today, there ain't no tomorrow.

NEW JERSEY looks at JOHN PARKER again.  He sees a Black Lectroid.

JOHN PARKER:
        We have only two hundred and forty minutes remaining.

NEW JERSEY looks very disturbed.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Right.  I'm working under the assumption that Penny still has the
        overthruster, but this psycho Whorfin doesn't _know_ that.  So
        that'll be my job, to get her and it back in one piece.  Your
        objective is to eighty-six Whorfin.  You know your two strike 
        groups.  Apache Group, that's you, Reno; Chapparal Group, that's
        you, Perfect Tommy.  John Parker, you ride with Chapparal.  It's
        my guess that no human being has _ever_ been inside the place,
        so who knows what we're gonna find there.  Top priority is the
        overthruster.  Without it, Whorfin can't get off this planet.
        This homing device will probably make it easy to find.
        It may be a lot harder to get back.


PRESIDENT WIDMARK's hospital room.  SMIRNOFF is on the phone.

SMIRNOFF:
        Strategic Space Command now reports all satellite communication
        jammed.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Jammed?!  By who?  Who by?

SMIRNOFF:
        Ah, possible atmospheric conditions, sir.  Solar.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM:
        Solar?

SMIRNOFF:
        Intelligence confirms that Soviets are having the same problem.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Ahhh... Should we be on _Code Red_?

GENERAL CATBURD:
        We go to Code Red, the Russians go to Code Red.  No sense going
        off half-cocked, Mr. President.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM:
        I don't know, but Buckaroo Banzai has never been wrong before.

GENERAL CATBURD:
        The man's been through _solid matter_, for crying out loud!  Who
        knows what's happened to his brain?  Maybe it's scrambled his
        molecules!  All I'm saying, Mr. President, is let's not _panic_!

Weird electronic noises as the room lights flicker and turn red.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        What's happening?

SMIRNOFF:
        Uh... electromagnetic pulse, sir.  Russians just gone to Defense
        Condition Two, sir.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        No choice, then.

GENERAL CATBURD:
        Mr. President, I am a soldier.  And I'm a damn good one.  I've
        got enough decorations to snap a Christmas tree!  All I'm trying
        to say is, and I hope I speak for everyone in this room, is that 
        I am scared.  I'm barely holding my... fudge, right now.

Cut to SENATOR CUNNINGHAM.  She is disgusted.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM:
        Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl, General, and pull 
        yourself together.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        I'm glad _someone_ has the _balls_ to face facts!


[[ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE:

WIDMARK: (mumbling) Forget we're the good guys and we never attack first... 
they think we're godless monsters just like them... put yourself in their samovars...
sitting in the dark without radar... no way they're going to listen to _reason_...

CATBIRD goes out of the room to an MP box outside. A DRESS MARINE snaps to attention.

CATBIRD: What are you waiting for, Lieutenant?

DRESS MARINE: NOTHING, SIR!

CATBIRD: Get that thing in here.

DRESS MARINE: SIR, YES, SIR!]]


Staging area.
BUCKAROO BANZAI is preparing to leave for Yoyodyne in the jet car.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Don't embarrass us.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Have I ever?...  Gimme thirty minutes, then come in and mop up.
        
He starts the jet car.  It sounds like it needs a new muffler.


Hallway at Yoyodyne.  JOHN O'CONNOR is dragging PENNY PRIDDY to the Pit.
She breaks away and runs.  Another RED LECTROID appears in front of her
and they grab her.  She struggles.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        No... oh no!

JOHN O'CONNOR:
        I've had ENOUGH of you, Penny Priddy!

They wrestle her to the floor, which is ankle-deep in greenish water.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        Nooo!


PRESIDENT WIDMARK's hospital room.  MRS. JOHNSON has just finished playing 
JOHN ENDALL's message.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Well... Mrs. Johnson, thank you.  It's certainly... food for thought.

SMIRNOFF:
        No answer at the Kremlin, sir.  Just dead silence.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        Then, I guess... the moment is upon us.

GENERAL CATBURD:
        Here ya go, Mr. President.  The Presidential emergency action
        documents.  For your eyes only.  John Hancock these, and Hail Mary.

GENERAL CATBURD hands documents to the PRESIDENT.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM:
        You know... on second thought, maybe we should think this through
        a bit more, so that future generations of Americans will...

The lights dim and flicker again.  More weird electronic noises.

MRS. JOHNSON:
        Oh, wow.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK:
        (reading document)  Declaration of War - the Short Form.


Road outside the Yoyodyne plant.  The jet car pulls up to the gate.

GUARD:
        Okay, bring that thing right through the gate.  Straight
        ahead.  Straight ahead.


Interior of the plant.  DR. LIZARDO is on a high platform, haranguing
the RED LECTROIDS.  He is wearing his greatcoat and medals, and trying to
imitate Benito Mussolini.

DR. LIZARDO:
        BLACKS!  Are on this planet!  HERE!  In-a New Jersey!  Coming
        to destroy us!  We must act!  ESCAPE, or die!  We must-a work
        _faster_, to-a finish the Great Vehicle Itself, so that we can-a
        enter the 8th dimension, and FREE our trapped comrades, so
        we can return home, and seize power once again!
        WHAT IS THE GREATEST JOY?

RED LECTROIDS on the floor of the plant are sitting around, eating junk
food and watching TV.  They don't seem too excited.

RED LECTROIDS:
        The joy of duty.

DR. LIZARDO:
        LOUDER!

RED LECTROIDS:
        THE JOY OF DUTY!

DR. LIZARDO:
        History... is-a made at night!  Character... is what you are in
        the dark!  We must WORK, while the clock, she's-a ticking!

RED LECTROID:
        Death to the Black Lectroids!

DR. LIZARDO:
        WHERE ARE WE GOING?

The RED LECTROIDS are a little more animated now.

RED LECTROIDS:
        Planet Ten!

DR. LIZARDO:
        WHEN?

RED LECTROIDS:
        Real Soon!


Directed by the GUARD, BUCKAROO BANZAI drives the jet car into the building.

GUARD:
        C'mon, bring it over here.  This way.  _This_ way!  Now park it.


BUCKAROO BANZAI climbs out as RED LECTROIDS surround the car.
DR. LIZARDO watches from a catwalk as JOHN GOMEZ searches the jet car.

JOHN GOMEZ:
        There's no overthruster!  Get him in here.  
        Get him out of there!  I wanna see his face!  IT'S NOT HERE!

JOHN BIGBOOTE punches BUCKAROO BANZAI in the stomach.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Take him... to the Shock Tower!


Shot of PENNY PRIDDY in the Pit.  Sound of water dripping.  She is tied to
some kind of frame.  A tarantula is crawling up her leg.


Meanwhile, BUCKAROO BANZAI has been put in the Shock Tower.  A device is
lowered onto his head.

DR. LIZARDO:
        The equations... solve them!  Enter your data on this-a keypad.
        And they better be right.  The Shock Tower... is a lie detector.
        Any falsehood triggers a brutal charge to your... auditory meatus.

COMPUTER VOICE:
        Open circuit.

DR. LIZARDO:
        So??!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        You're not getting _jack_ from me until you let Penny out of
        this junkyard.

DR. LIZARDO:
        CURSE-A YOU, BANZAI!  Don't you-a realize what you are _saying_?
        Your whole planet's gonna be destroyed, and you sit here wasting
        time!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Time?  I've got nothing _but_ time.

DR. LIZARDO throws a switch and BUCKAROO BANZAI is shocked.

DR. LIZARDO:
        (gloating)
        Sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife...  Doomed is-a your _soul_,
        and damned is your _life_!

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Buh... buzz off.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Bigbooty, more... _power_ to him.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        (annoyed)  Bigboo-TAY.

DR. LIZARDO:
        I want-a my missing circuit!  NOW!

JOHN BIGBOOTE turns the power up.
BUCKAROO BANZAI is shocked again, and screams.


Staging area.  PERFECT TOMMY is sitting under a large umbrella outside the
tour bus.  A helicopter lands and drops off the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE as
the Rugsuckers' van arrives.
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE strides up to PERFECT TOMMY.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Is there something I can help you with, John?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Is Buckaroo upstairs?

JOHN PARKER exits the bus, waves to the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

JOHN PARKER:
        'Ello, Mr. Secret'ry.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Where is he?
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE climbs aboard the bus.


Back to the Shock Tower.  BUCKAROO BANZAI has not been cooperative.

COMPUTER VOICE:
        That won't work either.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Cursed computer!


He stands up and snaps his fingers.  A RED LECTROID moves to turn several
TV monitors on.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Eyy, Banzai.  Take a look at-a your girl friend.

DR. LIZARDO grins, then notices one monitor is blank.  He curses in Italian
and switches it on.  PENNY PRIDDY is visible in the Pit.

DR. LIZARDO:
        She'll-a live, but... only for a while.  And she won't-a enjoy it!
        Only _you_ can save her from a fate even worse than that-a of your
        friend, Mr. Rawhide!

[[SCENE: On the bus:

CATBURD: Anybody got anything? Or are we still blacked out?

NJ: We sit here for 12 more minutes; Buckaroo's orders.

CATBURD: Damn Buckaroo!

CATBIRD grabs a gun from PERFECT TOMMY and leaves the bus]]

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        The missing circuit's in your _head_, Whorfin.


[[MISSING DIALOGUE: According to Peter Weller, 
Rick Richter most regretted this dialogue cut:

JOHN WHORFIN: Whorfin? How did you know that was my secret identity?!?

BUCKAROO: John Emdall spilled the beans.

JOHN WHORFIN is shocked in turn.]]


DR. LIZARDO:
        Bigbooty... activate your probes!

JOHN BIGBOOTE throws switch.  BUCKAROO BANZAI is shocked again. 
He grits his teeth.


The tour bus passes a billboard showing a Boy Scout holding a tiny American
flag and saluting the Yoyodyne logo.  At the top is the legend "The Future
Begins Tomorrow."  At the bottom, it says "A Growing Excited Company."
The bus pulls up to the main gate.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Slow this sucker down.  I'll handle these birds.

JOHN YAYA:
        Whoa!


The bus stops. 
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE jumps off and goes up to the guard shack.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        You young gentlemen have a telephone in here, ah, you wanna jump on
        the horn and get me Mr. John Big Boot?

JOHN YAYA:
        Bigboo-TAY.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Oh, hell, wanna do _anything_ nowadays, you gotta do it yourself!

The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE storms into the shack.  JOHN YAYA follows and grabs
the phone before the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE can pick it up.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        What is your name?

The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE pulls a notebook out of his pocket.  Outside, the
tour bus drives through the gate.  The security guards don't notice.

JOHN YAYA:
        John Yaya.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        John Yaya, huh?  And you are...
        (reads his badge)  John Small Berries!


The tour bus pulls to a stop inside the Yoyodyne complex.  The door is flung
open and various Hong Kong Cavaliers jump out, brandishing assorted assault
weapons.  They cautiously head for the main building.  PERFECT TOMMY is in
the lead.

[[many minor cuts were made in the Yoyodyne interior chase and infiltrate scenes;
actually, to the better; it's tighter in the finished form. Some dialogues or scenes
seemed to help support the story; I have included that material.]]


JOHN PARKER:
        (pointing)  It's down dere.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        What?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        I feel it.  (He runs ahead.)
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        Oh.  We're not...
        
        
They advance past what looks like part of a sewage treatment plant and
enter the main building.  Television sets are placed randomly amid
piles of junk.

JOHN PARKER:
        It's a nest.
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        Birds nest.  People don't nest.
        
JOHN PARKER:
        (shakes his head)  Red Lectroid...
        
They hear something that sounds like a music box.  Moving forward to
investigate, they find a toy carousel.  It is turning and playing a little
tune.  PERFECT TOMMY thinks it's cute.


BILLY TRAVERS:
        Don't touch it.  It might be a bomb, man.
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        Naw...  It's a toy.
        
With a shriek, a RED LECTROID drops onto PERFECT TOMMY's back from overhead.
There is a brief struggle, ending when one of the other Hong Kong Cavaliers
breaks its neck.


Cut to an office in the Yoyodyne building.  A GUARD is sitting behind the
desk as the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE strides in.

GUARD:
        Sir?
        
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Sit down!
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE heads down the hall.

GUARD:
        Hey, that area's restricted!
        
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Yeah?  Not to me!
        

Interior of the main building.  Shots of the Hong Kong Cavaliers covering each
other as they advance.  Many RED LECTROIDS are sitting around, oblivious.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        What _is_ this place?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        It's a bivouac.  They sleep here.
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        [unintelligible]

JOHN PARKER:
        You better believe it.
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        Lizardo.  Which way?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        (pointing)  Over dere.
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        You sure?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Believe it!
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        Just hold on a second.


PERFECT TOMMY runs across an open space.  In the foreground, several
RED LECTROIDS are watching TV and eating potato chips.  JOHN PARKER follows.


PERFECT TOMMY and the rest of Chapparal Group take cover behind a large piece
of machinery on the factory floor.  Apache Group rejoins them.

RENO NEVADA:
        What's going _on_, man?  Where _are_ we?
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        It's a bivouac, man.  They sleep here.
        
Suddenly, the alarm on PERFECT TOMMY's watch goes off.  As he tries to shut it
off, a RED LECTROID hears the beeping, runs to a control panel, and sets off
an alarm.  A klaxon sounds, and the Hong Kong Cavaliers turn and fire
at the LECTROID.  He is hit, and the control panel explodes in a shower
of sparks.


The Shock Tower room.  The klaxon can be heard, and the lights flicker as
the power fails.

DR. LIZARDO:
        (panicked)  What's happening?


Shot of BUCKAROO BANZAI in the Shock Tower.  The probes retract.  DR. LIZARDO
and JOHN BIGBOOTE have forgotten BUCKAROO BANZAI as they respond to the
emergency.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Bigbooty!  Go down to the Pit.  KILL THE GIRL!
        
        
Factory floor.  The RED LECTROIDS are aware of the intruders now, but the
Hong Kong Cavaliers are mowing them down as they attack.  Gunfire, RED
LECTROIDS being hit and falling from rafters, etc.

CASPER LINDLEY:
        Scooter!  Where are you?
        
        
Cut to RED LECTROIDS swarming around their ship, elsewhere in the factory.
JOHN BIGBOOTE enters, takes charge.


Shock Tower.  DR. LIZARDO fiddles with controls.

DR. LIZARDO:
        Eyy!  Somebody shut off that gosh-damned klaxon!
        
He picks up his overthruster and leaves, ignoring BUCKAROO BANZAI who is now
freeing himself from the restraints of the Shock Tower.

PA VOICE:
        Work, work, work.  There are monkey-boys in the facility.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI looks for a way out of the Shock Tower room.

PA VOICE:
        You are secure.  Do not panic.  John Endall must die.
        Lord Whorfin must live.
        
        
Hallway.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE knocks on a door.  A sign reads
"NOBUDY CUMZ IN HERE - SEKRIT".  He opens the door.

PA VOICE:
        Work, work, work.
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE enters a weirdly-lit room containing a maze of
plastic sheeting hanging from the ceiling.


Another hallway.  NEW JERSEY staggers down the hall, panting.  Suddenly someone
touches his shoulder.  There is a bright flash.

NEW JERSEY:
        Uhhhh!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Sorry... I'm sorry, Sidney.
        
NEW JERSEY:
        Buckaroo!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        It's good to see you, pal.  You got a pistol?
        
NEW JERSEY:
        Yeah.  (hands revolver to BUCKAROO BANZAI)
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (pops cylinder, checks to see if pistol is loaded)
        What are you gonna use?
        
NEW JERSEY draws another gun, spins it flashily.

NEW JERSEY:
        Where _are_ we?
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        I'd hate to tell you.
        
NEW JERSEY:
        Uh, where're we going?
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI produces a hand-held direction finder.  An illuminated arrow 
flashes, and there is a clicking sound a lot like a car's turn signal.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        This way.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI and NEW JERSEY move off.


Meanwhile, the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE emerges into the area of the plant where 
the spaceship is being completed.  Power tools can be heard in the background.

PA VOICE:
        Keep your noses to the grindstone.  The greatest joy is the joy
        of duty.  Work, work, work.
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE stares in disbelief at the giant spaceship.

PA VOICE:
        The monkey-boys are evil.  Lord Whorfin is supreme.
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE spots JOHN BIGBOOTE supervising the workers.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Big Boot?  Big Boot!  C'mon a minute, I wanna talk to you!

JOHN BIGBOOTE looks up, surprised.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Hey, what the hell's the matter with you?  You deaf?  I said, 
        I wanna talk to you!


[[SCENE: CATBURD, following JOHN BIGBOOTÉ, gets entangled in the moving, 
rubbery bands of some strange engine]]
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE turns and leaves through a door marked "PITT".


Dark hallway.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and NEW JERSEY advance to an intersection with
another corridor.  RED LECTROIDS attack in turn from each of the four
directions and are alternately gunned down by BUCKAROO BANZAI and NEW JERSEY.
They look at each other, and NEW JERSEY blows the smoke from the muzzle of
his gun.


The Pit.  JOHN BIGBOOTE and JOHN O'CONNOR are preparing to kill PENNY PRIDDY
as the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE enters.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        (steps in ankle-deep water)  Jeez!
        What the HELL is going on here, Big Boot?  Where's my bomber?
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Bigboo-TAY.
        John O'Connor, put the Smon on the track.
        
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        Hey, I don't give a flying handshake WHAT your name is, I'm
        here to see a bomber.
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE stares at PENNY PRIDDY.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        _This_ sure ain't it.
        
JOHN O'CONNOR smiles strangely as he puts a slimy alien slug-like thing on a 
track that slopes down towards PENNY PRIDDY's head.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Let's just go back upstairs to my office.  Talk about this like
        two reasonable beings.
        
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        (gestures at PENNY PRIDDY)
        Now you listen to me.  Your private life, that's your own concern, but
        I'm here to see a _bomber_, and I'm damn sure gonna see it _now_!
        
        (points to the water on the floor)
        Look... LOOK at this place!  Don't you have any PRIDE?  It looks like
        a goddamn _pigsty_!
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE grabs the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE's necktie and hoists
him off his feet.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        It's not my goddamn PLANET, understand, MONKEY-BOY?
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE drops the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, who falls to the floor.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Let's get out of here, John O'Connor.
        
JOHN O'CONNOR:
        (disappointed)
        But John Whorfin _said_ we could kill her.
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        DAMN JOHN WHORFIN AND THE HORSE HE RODE IN ON!
        
They leave as the alien creature begins to ooze down the track towards
PENNY PRIDDY.


Hallway.  A RED LECTROID screams and lunges towards BUCKAROO BANZAI.
A shot rings out and the LECTROID falls.  PERFECT TOMMY appears.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        You owe me one, bud.
        

        
The Pit.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE comes to.  He spots PENNY PRIDDY's purse
and crawls painfully towards it.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        (gritting his teeth)
        It's not over yet...  I may be down, but I'm not out.
        

[[ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE: 

    CATBURD: I'm not down yet! I'll come out of this smelling like a goddamned rose!

He fondles the Overthruster.]]

He reaches the purse.  The overthruster beeps from inside.
Suddenly BUCKAROO BANZAI and NEW JERSEY burst in, and star at the 
Smon making its way down the track towards PENNY's face.


NEW JERSEY:
        What is THAT?
        Don't pick it up!  Don't....

There is a high-pitched squeal as BUCKAROO BANZAI sweeps the alien thing off
the track.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE pockets the overthruster and crawls away
unnoticed as BUCKAROO BANZAI and NEW JERSEY bend over PENNY PRIDDY, 
who is unconscious.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Penny...
        (He grabs her wrist, feeling for a pulse.)
        How's she doing?
        
NEW JERSEY:
        Uhh...  I don't know?
        
PERFECT TOMMY searches PENNY PRIDDY's purse.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        There's no overthruster.
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Buckaroo Banzai!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        What?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Dere is little time!  You better come quickly, if your planet is
        still important to you!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI is torn between PENNY PRIDDY and the call of duty.

NEW JERSEY:
        Leave her to me.  You take care of business.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI hesitates.

NEW JERSEY:
        Go.  Go.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Right.
        
JOHN PARKER leaves, followed by BUCKAROO BANZAI.


Control room.  JOHN BIGBOOTE enters.  JOHN O'CONNOR is helping DR. LIZARDO
with his coat.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Where's Buckaroo Banzai?
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        He has-a flown the coop.  Is the girl dead?
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Yes!
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Then sound the call to board the ship!
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        (exasperated)
        Without the crucial missing circuit, we'll never _make_ it!
        
JOHN O'CONNOR:
        They are only monkey-boys... we can still crush them here on
        Earth, Lord Whorfin!
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Noooo...  it's-a time to go home!
        John Bigbooty - you carry my overthruster.  John O'Connor, _you_
        stick-a by my side!
        
DR. LIZARDO and JOHN O'CONNOR hurry off.  JOHN BIGBOOTE is shocked that he is
apparently no longer second in command.


Factory floor.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER are sneaking towards the ship.

PA VOICE:
        The great vehicle itself is now in final boarding state.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI sees the ship for the first time.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        What is _that_?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Is a troop ship.  Lord Whorfin....


Cut to the basket of a cherry picker lifting DR. LIZARDO, JOHN O'CONNOR,
and JOHN BIGBOOTE to the ship.  DR. LIZARDO spots BUCKAROO BANZAI below.

DR. LIZARDO:
        MASSACRE THEM WITHOUT A QUARTER!
        
RED LECTROIDS attack BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER, and are defeated in
bitter hand-to-hand combat.


Interior of ship.  A hatch in the floor opens and DR. LIZARDO is helped inside.

INTERCOM VOICE:
        His extreme eminence, Lord Whorfin, is now aboard.
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Tell the flight attendants to close the doors, and prepare for
        cross check!
        

Factory floor.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER run towards the ship, gunning 
down RED LECTROIDS as they go.  They reach some scaffolding, and climb towards
the ship.

PA VOICE:
        If you are not inside at this point, you have missed the boat.
        

Interior of thermopod.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER climb through
the hatch.

PA VOICE:
        We are now go for launch.
        
They cautiously explore the thermopod.  Suddenly the hatch closes, trapping
them inside.


Ship's control room.  Frenzied preparations are being made for departure.

DR. LIZARDO:
        John O'Connor!  Install my overthruster!
        
INTERCOM VOICE:
        ... all carry-on baggage overhead and secure.
        
A RED LECTROID switches the ship to internal power, and lights go on.


Thermopod.  BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER can now see the interior.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        What is this?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        It looks like one of our thermopods.
        (ominously)
        But it's a _very_ bad design.
        
They experiment with various controls.  DR. LIZARDO's voice is heard on
the intercom system.

DR. LIZARDO:
        ... your tray tables, secure!  And your seat backs in the full
        upright position!


Ship's control room.

JOHN O'CONNOR:
        Your overthruster is in place, Lord Whorfin!
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        (gesturing wildly)
        It won't work!  IT WON'T WORK!
        
DR. LIZARDO turns to shout at JOHN BIGBOOTE.

DR. LIZARDO:
        SHUT UP, John Bigbooty, you COWARD!  You're da weakest individual
        I ever knew!
        
DR. LIZARDO turns back to the controls as, behind him, JOHN BIGBOOTE 
gives him the finger.


Meanwhile, the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE is snooping around the jet car, which is
covered in plastic.

SCOOTER LINDLEY:
        Get away from that car, or I drink your BLOOD!
        
The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE looks around, and sees SCOOTER LINDLEY aiming an
M-14 rifle at him.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        (nervously)
        Whatcha got there, son?  That's...  uh... not _real_, is it?
        
SCOOTER LINDLEY fires a round at the ceiling.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
jumps back.

SCOOTER LINDLEY:
        Get 'em up.


Ship's control room.  Preparation for launch continues.  DR. LIZARDO is 
removing his shoes so he can work a set of levers with his feet.

VOICE:
        H2 tank pressurization, okay.  We are go for launch.
        
VOICE:
        John Many Jars, establish overthruster beam grid, over!
        Activate oscillator!
        

Factory floor.  BILLY TRAVERS stares at the ship as three bright blue beams of
light appear and wave around wildly, trying to line up with a grid painted
on the wall.


Control room.

DR. LIZARDO:
        John O'Connor!  MY OVERTHRUSTER!
        
He moves levers with his feet.


Exterior.  The ship lurches, and begins to move along its track.  A few
RED LECTROIDS are still outside.

RED LECTROID:
        Don't leave!  DON'T LEAVE!
        

Quick cuts between control room, thermopod, and exterior as the ship
jolts down the track.

RED LECTROID:
        NOOOOOO!  WAIT!


Thermopod cockpit.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        If they can't connect the dots, they'll never penetrate.
        

The ship lurches to a stop.
BUCKAROO BANZAI stares as a milky fluid pours through a channel in the
thermopod's cockpit.

VOICE:
        ... fluid valves now closed.  The problem is corrected.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Wh... what _is_ that?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Is okay.  No worry.  Is an insulatin' liquid.
        

Control room.  DR. LIZARDO is speaking into a microphone.

DR. LIZARDO:
        FULL SPEED AHEAD!  And may I remind you, to fasten your-a seat belts,
        and esstinguish all smoking materials.

JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        We haven't a CHANCE!  Your overthruster is SHIT!  We'll lose...
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        One more WORD out of you, BigBOOTY...
        
JOHN BIGBOOTE:
        Bigboo-TAY!  Tay!  TAY!!!
        
DR. LIZARDO pulls a gun, turns, and shoots JOHN BIGBOOTE.


Cut to thermopod cockpit.

DR. LIZARDO:
        (on intercom)
        Welcome aboard, Banzai.  You're NEXT!
        

Control room.

VOICE:
        Roger, John Mudhead.
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Let's-a go home.
        
VOICE:
        Horizontal velocity is expanding, over.
        

Exterior of ship as massive cables begin to drag it down the track again.

VOICE:
        The wall is softening.


Thermopod.  A cover is removed, and BUCKAROO BANZAI and JOHN PARKER can now
see out the thermopod's windshield.  The wall and its grid markings are 
coming towards them.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Oh, no.
        
        
Quick shots of beams dancing on the grid, DR. LIZARDO's feet frantically
moving controls, the ship accelerating down the track, and the thermopod
cockpit.  BUCKAROO BANZAI ducks just before impact.


Exterior of Yoyodyne's main building.  A section of the wall crumbles
and debris flies as the ship smashes through the wall.  In the control
room, DR. LIZARDO is still manipulating his levers.

VOICE:
        Danger, danger.  We do not have crossover.
        
VOICE:
        Negative mass is critical.
        

View of industrial park as the ship accelerates into a climbing turn.


In the BLACK LECTROID command ship, the WING COMMANDER is eavesdropping on
the RED LECTROID's intercom.

RED VOICE 1:
        We are not in the 8th dimension.  We are over New Jersey.
        
RED VOICE 2:
        All is not lost.
        
RED VOICE 1:
        But we are...
        
WING COMMANDER:
        Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.
        

Thermopod cockpit.  DR. LIZARDO's voice is heard on the intercom.

DR. LIZARDO:
        So sorry, gentlemen.  But I must-a drop the excess baggage.


The thermopod is jettisoned and drops like a rock.

DR. LIZARDO:
        ARRIVIDERCI, BANZAI!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Where's the power?
        
JOHN PARKER:
        I am a diplomat!  I failed flight school!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI grabs a cable hanging from the wall.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        What do we do?  Jump-start it?
        
Seconds before impact, he plugs the cable into a panel.  Whining noises as
the power comes on, and the thermopod stops falling and hovers.  He 
experiments with various controls.


Cut to exterior.  The thermopod climbs, dives, and turns erratically as
BUCKAROO BANZAI tries to figure out how to fly it.


Back to the cockpit.  JOHN PARKER looks very relieved.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        ... stabilizers...
        
JOHN PARKER:
        What's dis?  (indicating a handgrip and trigger next to him)
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Looks like a gun.
        
He pulls the trigger.  There is a whooshing sound, and a pulsing beam of red
light shoots from the front of the thermopod.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        John Parker, take this wheel.
        
They switch places.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Just... just hold on... that's good.  It flies like a truck.
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Good.  What is a truck?


Cut to DR. LIZARDO at the controls of the ship.

VOICE:
        Electric beam is fine, Lord Whorfin.
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Heh heh heh.
        
        
Back to thermopod.  BUCKAROO BANZAI is studying the weapons panel.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Gotta be something to aim...  aim...  aim...
        
JOHN PARKER:
        Whoa!
        
The ship pops out of a cloud directly in front of them, on a collision course.
JOHN PARKER spins the wheel wildly, and they evade the ship just in time.  The
thermopod turns to follow it.


Control room.

VOICE:
        Thermopod on our tail, over.
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        (hisses)
        Banzai!  So, you wanna play GAMES, eh?...
        

Thermopod.  Voices from the ship can be heard on a speaker.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Where's the stabilizer?
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        ... you wanna play HIDE and SEEK, hanh?
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        All right.
        
SHIP VOICE:
        Commence evasive action, over.


The ship begins to jink back and forth, trying to shake the thermopod.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Okay.  Okay.  Start left.  Go left.  More, more, more, more...
        left, left...  LEFT!  I said LEFT!
        
JOHN PARKER:
        This _is_ left!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        I mean _my_ left!  On...  go _your_ right!
        

Control room.  DR. LIZARDO kicks levers frantically as the ship tries to evade.

VOICE:
        Faster.  He is gaining.
        
DR. LIZARDO:
        Feets!  Do your stuff!
        

Back to thermopod.  BUCKAROO BANZAI is sighting in on the ship.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Locking, locking now, locking...
        
SHIP VOICE:
        DIVE!  DIVE!  DIVE!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        ...now, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive...
        
They dive to follow the ship.

SHIP VOICE:
        Repeat, Lord Whorfin!  Repeat!  DIVE!  DIVE!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Whorfin...  Sayonara.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI pulls the trigger.


Cut to closeup of DR. LIZARDO at controls.

DR. LIZARDO:
        BANZAI!!  I'LL SEE YOU IN-A HELL!!!


Back to thermopod.  The ship explodes in a massive fireball.

JOHN PARKER:
        We got him!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Go LEFT!  Stop!
        
He grabs controls, stops the thermopod before it flies into the expanding
fireball.


Below, members of Team Banzai look up as the explosion lights up the sky.


Black command ship.

BLACK LECTROID:
        John Whorfin...  _destroyed_.
        
WING COMMANDER:
        Deactivate particle beam.  Tracking zero... zero... zero.
        

BUCKAROO BANZAI is descending on a parachute.  He salutes as JOHN PARKER
hovers the thermopod next to him, then flies away.  BUCKAROO BANZAI waves.


Outside Yoyodyne.  PERFECT TOMMY and RENO NEVADA run up as BUCKAROO BANZAI
lands next to the building.

RENO NEVADA:
        Hah hah!
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        That was one time I thought you'd bought it.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Yeah, me too.  Where's Penny?
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        At the bus.  New Jersey helped me bring her back.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        How is she?  Okay?
        
PERFECT TOMMY:
        He said he'd pull her through.  Quite a guy, you want my opinion.
        

Cut to SECRETARY OF DEFENSE and SCOOTER LINDLEY sitting on a bench.
SCOOTER LINDLEY is holding the overthruster and covering the
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE with his M-14.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        You give me that gizmo, I'll give you a _brand new_ crisp
        twenty-dollar bill.  Hunh?
        
SCOOTER LINDLEY grins and shakes his head.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE takes his
hat off and offers it and the money.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
        All right, I'll tell you what...


BUCKAROO BANZAI, PERFECT TOMMY, and RENO NEVADA walk up.

PERFECT TOMMY:
        Hey, Scooter!  Fall in.
        
SCOOTER LINDLEY whips the $20 out of the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE's hand and
pockets it as he stands up.  The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE sneaks away.

SCOOTER LINDLEY:
        This what you're lookin' for, Buckaroo?
        
He gives BUCKAROO BANZAI the overthruster.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Scooter...
        (looks at PERFECT TOMMY)
        You got _his_ job.
        
SCOOTER LINDLEY:
        All right!
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        You wanna ride with me in the jet car?
        
SCOOTER LINDLEY:
        Wow!  You know it!...  But I have to ask my dad first.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Okay, you ask your dad.  I'll wash up.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI grins at PERFECT TOMMY and walks away.
PERFECT TOMMY looks upset.  RENO NEVADA punches his shoulder.

RENO NEVADA:
        Awwwww....
        

BUCKAROO BANZAI walks up to the bus.  NEW JERSEY is standing at the door. 
He shakes his head.

NEW JERSEY:
        I did all I could.

BUCKAROO BANZAI boards the bus and passes through the commo center.

RADAR BLAZE 1:
        Buckaroo, the President's on line 1, calling about is everything okay
        with the alien space bomb and Planet Ten, or should we just go ahead
        and destroy Russia?
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        (distracted)
        Tell him yes on one and no on two.
        
RADAR BLAZE 2:
        Which was yes?  The destroy Russia, or the, uh, number two?


BUCKAROO BANZAI ignores him and goes to a bedroom.  PENNY PRIDDY is lying on a
futon, completely covered by a white sheet.  He whips the sheet away, to reveal
her lying on her back, with her arms crossed.

BUCKAROO BANZAI slowly bends down to kiss PENNY PRIDDY.  As he is about to
touch her lips, there is a bright blue flash and a spark jumps between them.
BUCKAROO BANZAI is thrown backwards.

NOVA POLICE officer grins.

BUCKAROO BANZAI sits up, rubbing his face.  He looks at PENNY PRIDDY, then
stares in disbelief as her leg moves slightly.  

He bends down to kiss her again.  Small sparks as their lips touch.  He
pulls away as she slowly opens her eyes.


BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        Careful.   You're all right.

Cut to command ship.  The BLACK LECTROIDS are eavesdropping as usual.

PENNY PRIDDY:
        You look awful, Buckaroo.
        
BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        You don't exactly light up a party yourself...

Back to the bedroom.

BUCKAROO BANZAI:
        ... Penny Priddy.
        
They embrace, and PENNY PRIDDY pulls him down onto the futon as he closes
the blinds.

WING COMMANDER:
        So what.  Big deal.
        
Fade to black.


Title appears.
